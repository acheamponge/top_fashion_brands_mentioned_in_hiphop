Passion in the motion I expressed.\\nOverwhelmed by you're presence always content never wanted anybody else I thought if heaven exists its here. Until my happiness turned to tears. All my fears exposed. Like a bad dream with no close. Screaming for help but everytime I wept, you left, you fucking left without once looking back. I didn't know how to react, my love for you was under attack, I couldnt take it. I needed you back. I came cryin' to you, 'till everything was cool, Atleast until I thought it was. Fuck the drugs! Being around you was my buzz. we had a energy a type of chemistry that kept me fiendin for u. But there's no high in the world that lasts forever, lasts forever...\\nVERSE 2\\nWhenever we disagree you push me out the door and leave. But you keep the door open, just enuff, that when push comes to shove you can string me along like some fucked up R&B; song. 'cause after time apart, you miss me too much. so we have a break up fuck and each time it happens it made the passion even stronger, we stay together longer. But each break up got harder. I had the urge to be violent, jealousy I couldnt hide it. craziness I couldnt fight it. I was losing it. this is one big mind game fueled by pain that I couldnt escape. my sanity has been raped. what happened to fate? this is far from that. this is one fucking giant mistake. I was obsessed with you, you consume my brain. and worst of all it wasn't gonna change.\\nVERSE 3\\nI was changing for the worst, little shit made me curse. Each verse that I wrote was therapy.i couldnt cope, I'd smoke weed and flow.Escape in the agony of letting this control me. What is happening to me? I'm getting violent from all the screams and all this fighting. this is sucking all the life from me. This either gonna kill you or kill me. But without the high you give me I'm incomplete, so please accept me, and treat me with a little fucking dignity.'cause I need u. I can't function without u. nothing can replace u. the feeling that you bring is very addicting, very consuming. very controlling. this is killing me I need some fucking therapy. 'cause I'm sick of you controlling me. I wannafunction normally. like everybody else, and again find happiness. I need to know its for the best, I swear to god I'm putting you back on the shelf, miss addiction, 'cause now I'm respectin' myself\",\n",
