She ain't exclusive news\nShe only care about the money, she don't care 'bout you\nWhy you chasing that? She ain't exclusive news\nShe only care about the money, she don't care 'bout you\nShe ain't exclusive, she ain't exclusive, no\nShe ain't exclusive, she ain't exclusive, no\nShe ain't exclusive, she ain't exclusive, no\nShe ain't exclusive, she ain't exclusive, no\n\n[Verse 1]\nI had to swerve on the bitch, cause I'm 'bout my dollars\nThat's that same nasty bitch in that dirty Impala\nI'm all in every city cause I'm 'bout my dough\nThat ho used to fuck with Dan Marino\nShe ride your wave like a dolphin till you lay in the coffin\nShe always silent in the house but in the streets just talking\nBetter off passing her to one of your bros\nYou can't be sad in the streets when we don't love them hoes\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Outro]\nWhy you tricking that? Why you chasing that?\nWhy you tricking that? She ain't exclusive", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e2c6cfed8938d1c97285bb5e322dde89.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "I LOVE MAKONNEN", "year": null}]}
