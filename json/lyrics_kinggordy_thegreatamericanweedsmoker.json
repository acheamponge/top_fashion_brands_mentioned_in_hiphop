You can just go inside of my wife's butt.\" (Oh!)\nWhile I'm in front, got her in there wide to suck my right nut\nKnow why I like the Bushes, him and his wife like to try stuff\nMatter of fact, while my pipe was inside of his wife cunt\nI got him to sign a bill just to legalize kine buds (Yes)\nHis wife's sauce and mine got the right-to-light tight nugs\nA head is, whatever is better than any white drug\nSo send him your letters, the Federal Judge might budge\nIf he says \"never\", we'll head over there when night comes\nPut fav in his wifes' lungs (What)\nKeep nan for the nice judge\nWho said \"fuck you\" like you don't warrant you a nice buzz\nThey don't trust you like you gon' fuck somebody's life up\nWell, hippies follow me down this marijuana trail\nThrough America, got some marijuana stories to tell"}]}
