Tell your friends, they're leaving without ya!\nGot a hotel room with a view of the city that I know you gonna like\nGot the candles leading to the bathtub baby, let's hop inside!\nRide in the two door with the roof gone\nMy oh my, baby it's been too long\nSo grab your coat and your purse\nI'll walk out of here first\nWait about five and I'll be parked outside!\n\nI know we ain't got no strings attached\nBut this could be a perfect match!\nAnd girl, we ain't no cuddie buddies\nCause this is way more than that!\n\nYou're my boo thang\nCan't get enough, I love yo stuff!\nLet's turn it up, you get what you want\nCause you're my boo thang\nAnd when your friends ask\nI'm not ya man just the closest thing that you have!\nTo a boo thang, boo thang\nBoo thang, boo thang\nBoo thang, boo thang!\n\nHey, girl, I can't leave here without you, uh huh!\nAnd how you're looking I love everything about you!\nGirl it's more then your body, I'm making love to your mind\nAnd every time that I want you\nYou're ready all of the time!\n\nI know we ain't got no strings attached\nBut this could be a perfect match!\nAnd girl, we ain't no cuddie buddies\nCause this is way more than that!\n\nYou're my boo thang\nCan't get enough, I love you, stuff!\nLet's turn it up, you get what you want\nCause you're my boo thang\nAnd when your friends ask\nI'm not ya man just the closest thing that you have!\nTo a boo thang, boo thang\nBoo thang, boo thang\nBoo thang, boo thang!\n\nBaby turn the lights off\nAll I wanna do is touch you!\nWe can make a movie, baby\nNobody do it like us two!\nYeah, boy put your hands all on my body\nRide that thang just like a harley. so come on let's get it started!\nTurn the Lights off!
