We're so confused\nEasily led astray\nLet me tell ya that\nEverything is everything\n(Everything is everything)\nEverything is everything\nAfter winter, must come spring\nEverything is everything\n\nI philosophy\nPossibly speak tongues\nBeat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist\nRap this in fine linen\nFrom the beginning\nMy practice extending across the atlas\nI begat this\nFlippin' in the ghetto on a dirty mattress\nYou can't match this rapper / actress\nMore powerful than two Cleopatras\nBomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti\nMCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti\nMy rhymes is heavy like the mind of Sister Betty\nL. Boogie spars with stars and constellations\nThen came down for a little conversation\nAdjacent to the king, fear no human being\nRoll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum\nNow hear this mixture\nWhere hip hop meets scripture\nDevelop a negative into a positive picture\n\nNow everything, is everything\nWhat is meant to be, will be\nAfter winter, must come spring\nChange, it comes eventually\n\nSometimes it seems\nWe'll touch that dream\nBut things come slow or not at all\nAnd the ones on top, won't make it stop\nSo convinced that they might fall\nLet's love ourselves then we can't fail\nTo make a better situation\nTomorrow, our seeds will grow\nAll we need is dedication\n\nLet me tell ya that\nEverything is everything\n(Everything is everything)\nEverything is everything\nAfter winter, must come spring\nEverything is everything\n\nEverything is everything\nWhat is meant to be, will be\nAfter winter, must come spring\nChange, it comes eventually\n\nLa la la la la la la la (until song fades)"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
