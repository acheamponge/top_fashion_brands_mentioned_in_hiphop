(You Seem) Far Away.. So So (x2)\n\n[Verse 1]\nHopeless!\nI can spell it\nI can smell it in the air\nLotta people wonder if you still care\nAnd are you still there\nCuz I dun lost it all\nI keep calling your name\nBut do you hear my call\nAnd are you still involved\nOr am I left alone\nI wander the streets\nCuz I no longer have a home\nMy brothers all GONE\nMy sisters all GONE\nMy families and my friends ain't gonna be here in the Mornin\nYa see me hear mourning\nThey say you feel my pain\nThey say you went through it\nSay to die is to gain\nBut I ain't gain nothing\nI lost everybody\nNow Im losing my mind\nAnd my faith is all Im counting\nIm still holding on\nThats why Im still pray\nFeelin empty inside\nI can't make it through today\nI dont know what else to do\nI dont know what else to say\nIm talking to ya now\nBut I promise you feel so far\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nDear hope: Been waitin on ya for a while now\nBeen cut so deep that I ain't sure if I can smile now\nLook at this devastation\nLook at the pain and sorrow\nSomebody fed me lies and promised me a bright tomorrow\nI know the God I follow\nIs bigger than disaster\nBig enough to handle\nAny evil that harasses us\nBut I feel like he passed us\nPain overtook us\nBuildings tumble over head\nAs the ground shook us\nGod have you forsook us\nLord you still with me\nI know you save souls\nI trust you to forgive me\nRelief can you hear me\nHey Rest can you get me\nHey Peace can you see me\nHey love can you heal me\nI dont know what to do\nI ain't looking for answers\nI just need you to hold my hand\nThrough this cancer\nTell me you never left\nEven in the midst of death\nBreathe on me I'll do anything to feel your Breath\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Interlude]\nFor God alone, O my soul, wait in silence\nFor my hope is from him\nHe only is my rock and my salvation\nMy fortress; I shall not be shaken\nOn God rests my salvation and my glory;\nMy mighty rock, my refuge is God\nTrust in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before him;\nGod is a refuge for us\n\n[Outro]\n(Far far away.) Hes not (Far Away) No hes not (Far Away) Our Gods not Even though he seems"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
