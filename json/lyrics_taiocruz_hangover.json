Come again\nGive me Henn, give me gin, give me liquor\nGive me champagne bubbles 'til I'm bent\nWhat happens after that? If you inspired then tell a friend\nLike oh my homie Taio, we can all sip again\nGet it in and again and again, leave evidence\nWasted, so what? Irrelevant\nBeer keg to the head, who's selling it\nI got a hangover, that's my medicine\nDon't mean to brag or sound too intelligent\nA little Jack can't hurt this veteran\nI show up but I never throw up\nSo let the drinks pour up, pour up\n\n[Chorus: Taio Cruz]\nI got a hangover, wo-oh!\nI've been drinking too much for sure\nI got a hangover, wo-oh!\nI got an empty cup, pour me some more\nSo I can go until I blow up, eh\nAnd I can drink until I throw up, eh\nAnd I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh\nI wanna keep it going, keep keep it going, come on!\n\n[Chorus: Taio Cruz]\nI got a hangover, wo-oh!\nI've been drinking too much for sure\nI got a hangover, wo-oh!\nI got an empty cup, pour me some more\nSo I can go until I blow up, eh\nAnd I can drink until I throw up, eh\nAnd I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh\nI wanna keep it going, keep keep it going, come on!"}], "artist": "Taio Cruz"}
