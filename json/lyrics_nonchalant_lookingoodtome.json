Can we do this or not?\nI'm ready to give eveything that I got\nI'm waitin' on you to make the next move\nBut I hope you move quick or you're gonna knock the groove\nThe green lights flashin ready, set, go!\nEverything I think you need, yeah you know\nSexy little buggar, heart strings tugger\nTell me where she at cause I wanna thank your mother\nI don't give a damn about the rules that I'm breakin'\nStep onto your face, straight up with no fakin'\nYou're killing me softly so I'm pressed for time\nWhy don't you just say that you're gonna be mine\nCause ain't no other in the world for you lover\nAnd that's what you are, a sexy brown brother\nI'm keepin' it real so you know how I feel\nCause I want to be with you and just chill\n\n(chorus till fade...)"}], "artist": "Nonchalant"}
