Climb to the moon!\nWe on Today, Today, Matt Laur\nEvery 24 we going like Jack Bauer\nHear the bell ringing I'm thinking it's that hour\nTurning on my light and I set it to max power\nLet's keep it going and going, I'm talking moment to moment we live the high and the low\nAnd then when we're broken like cracking open a coconut we pull ourselves together again and we gotta go\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bridge (x4)]\nPushing offa the ground tonight\nI be up in the clouds tonight\nLooking over my town tonight\nIn the shadow we found the light", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0199ac49c667975a2b0c5188cae549aa.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "All You Can Do", "title": "Right Now"}]}
