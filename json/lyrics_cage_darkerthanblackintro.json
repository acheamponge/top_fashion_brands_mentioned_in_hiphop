We have\nDiscovered that an all encompassing substance\nCalled Dark Matter threatens our very existence is\nThis mysterious energy the true source of evil?\nAnd what small hope have we as black\nHoles angrily devour our floating islands of light\nTheory becomes reality and another cross lines\nThe cosmic roadside engulfed by something....\nDARKER THAN BLACK"}]}
