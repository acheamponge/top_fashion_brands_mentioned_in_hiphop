I ain't a younger for you\nI'm 35 and I look younger than yous\nThis is from the heart, I did it for the art\nCan't believe some of the shit that you've done for some views\nNow the years loom I lay my game flat\nI want my spot back take two\nBest fire in the booth since fire in the booth\nWe all know I give evidence right here is the proof", "year": "2019-10-12"}]}
