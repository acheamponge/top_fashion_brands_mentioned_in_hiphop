That's a no no\nSeen her back yard took [?] to the go-go\nWhite tee, Polo\nQuite G, low pro\nWe can just do it no Nike logo\nSpike Lee and at the game 'Mello dropped 40\nMoney real loud I don't yell a lot shorty\nLouboutin slippers Cinderella copped for me\nIf you got a hot friend you should tell her Hi for me\nShe say she got a man? Goddamn, how corny\nIf you treat the wood right a good..

Motherfucker POOM, POW!\nHunt for the pussy, I'ma gut the womb down\nHe don't fuck you like me you should cut the fool now\nI'm stuntin' too loud, I don't hear those weirdos\nMy niggas move birds like scarecrows, here goes\nThe S-W-A-GG-AB-OY, know why? I'm Gucci crazy\nI've been running through the paper like its loose leaf lately\nHad a bitter past all I need is two sweet ladies\nBigger house, bigger living room\nAnd I ain't talkin bout the living room\nPlay soccer, nigga, all I do is kick it to em\nIf they want game, damn right I'ma give it to em\n\n[Hook]"}]}
