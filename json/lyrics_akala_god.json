{"songs": [{"title": "God?", "lyrics": "As I lay on my back and look at the stars\nWith dreams of floating and going to Mars\nI can't help but feeling a little helpless\nAnd that makes me feel selfish\nHow can I among all this wonder\nStill be concerned with my own blunders\nHow am I among all this greatness\nPreoccupied with what my fate is?\n\nGod, can you tell me?\nIs that my nature\nIs that how you made me?\nOr is it what I learned since I was a baby\nAm I really gonna burn if I don't obey thee?\n\nGod, who are you?\nWhat are you?\nWhere are you?\nHow are you?\nA star you?\nWhat are you?\nWho are you?\n\nI must be sky high\nThinking we can vibe right\nLook you in your eye sight\nBlinded by divine light\nI'd love to know now if I have a role in your grand design\nGod, who are you?\nWhat are you?\nWhere are you?\nOr am I just someone like you floating in your space and time\n\nGod, who are you?\nWhat are you?\nWhere are you?\nHow are you?\n\nAs I lay on my back and look at the stars\nI try to imagine just how far\nFive of ten million light-years are\nAnd I can't do it, so I feel stupid\nAlso a feeling I can't describe\nAnd I won't try\nWords are not qualified\n\nGod, can you tell me\nDo you stand with us?\nDid you abandon us?\nAnd leave us to revel in our own disgust?\nWas intelligence given to olden us?\n\nIf our galaxy is just a piece of dust in the universe crust\nWe're just a grain, we think we're the desert\nCan you tell me, are we special?\nOr just a practice run\nActors for your fun\nWill the show finish\nSo we can start living?\n\nGod, who are you?\nWhat are you?\nWhere are you?\nHow are you?\nA star you?\nWhat are you?\nWho are you?\n\nI must be sky high\nThinking we can vibe right\nLook you in your eye sight\nBlinded by divine light\nI'd love to know now if I have a role in your grand design\nGod, who are you?\nWhat are you?\nWhere are you?\nOr am I just someone like you floating in your space and time\n\nGod, who are you?\nWhat are you?\nWhere are you?\nHow are you?\n\nGod, are you a man?\nDoes that mean...\nAnd if you're a woman\nWould you then...\nAre we made in your image\nOr have we made you in our likeness?\nOr are you just like us\nHappy then sad\nDo you get mad when you see people acting bad?\nOr are you too busy making up new galaxies\nTo notice human tragedies\nGod, can you tell me\nDo the animals talk among their selves about us\nAnd imagine how great things would be without us?\nAnd what's up with this chap Satan?\n\nGod, who are you?\nWhat are you?\nWhere are you?\nHow are you?\nA star you?\nWhat are you?\nWho are you?\n\nI must be sky high\nThinking we can vibe right\nLook you in your eye sight\nBlinded by divine light\nI'd love to know now if I have a role in your grand design\nGod, who are you?\nWhat are you?\nWhere are you?\nOr am I just someone like you floating in your space and time\n\nGod, who are you?\nWhat are you?\nWhere are you?\nHow are you?\n\nI'd love to know now if I have a role in your grand design\nGod, who are you?\nWhat are you?\nWhere are you?\nOr am I just someone like you floating in your space and time\n\nGod, who are you?\nWhat are you?\nWhere are you?\nHow are you?\nA star you?\nWhat are you?\nWho are you?\n\nGod, where are you?\nWho are you?\nWhat are you?\nA star you?\nHow are you?\nWhat are you?\nWhere are you?\nGod?", "year": "2010-05-03", "album": "DoubleThink", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1d372a1e5ce6759370053ad0e1be955f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
