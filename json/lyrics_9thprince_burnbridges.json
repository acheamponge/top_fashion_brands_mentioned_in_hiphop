Should we attack 'em?\nShould we gunsmack 'em or carjack 'em?\nSlap 'em, computer hack 'em\nBypasses the school, I failed 5 classes\nHad my eyes on the fat thighs and fat asses\nBig tits, I used to rock the Gucci knits\nAnd thick Polo sweaters with the horsey on the stitch\nNow I rock the W-U W-E-A-R, boy be a star\nNo matter who you are, A-B Allah, B-C Allah\nI was born in the wilderness with the urge of fullfillin' this\nRotten hip-hop that you crabs forgot\nWu what? Wu tucks, Wu cuts, Wu new chucks\nYou could suck dew nuts\n\n[Chorus: RZA (both)]\nSome of y'all niggas hold mic like bitches\nSome of y'all bitches hold mics like niggas\nHard for seeds to figure which is which is\nNow you wonder why your seed switches\nBurn the Bridges!\n(See some of y'all niggas hold mic like bitches\nSome of y'all bitches hold mics like niggas)\nHard for seeds to figure which is which is\nMake you wonder why your seed switches\nBurn the Bridges!\n\n[9th Prince]\nAiyo I spit lead, the aim strike for ya head\n9th Prince, sometimes I'm braindead\nSix foot four, kick down ya front door\nBreakin' all laws, verbal prostitute\nYa life is my whore, me and The RZA is like Twin Towers\nSmack you with the culture power, sweet and sour\nRain acid showers, so grab ya umbrella\nPoetry spoken accapella, the bad fellas\nYou can't feel us or smell us, or even rebel against us\nSo run for ya life par, fuck bein' a superstar\nGive life like Allah U Akbar\nStay in ya lane with ya Go Kart, we too smart\nHollow point darts that'll stop ya heart\nBeware of the dark, we teeth like tiger sharks\nOr Noah's Ark, head shock reveals the worst part\n\n[Chorus]", "year": null, "title": "Burn Bridges", "image": "https://images.genius.com/aee759b8fa2fa70e9bb2b738d3297e33.462x462x1.jpg"}]}
