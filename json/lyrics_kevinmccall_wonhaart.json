See, Valentine's Day is just a holiday where you show the people you love how much you love 'em, but a gentleman show that everyday\nDaddy, do you love my mommy?\nOf course I love your mommy, you look just like her, baby\nEwww... Gross, you're the worst man\nHeh, I know, baby, but that's real love\nWill you be my Valetine?\nEvery single day, baby\n\n[Hook: Kevin McCall]\nOnly got one heart\nSo many girls I love\nCan't make my mind\nThis time can take me time but I\nCan't keep falling in love\nWith all of y'all\nKeep falling in love\nWith all of y'all\nKeep falling in love\nWith all of y'all\nBut if I could, I would\nMake you all mine\n\n[Skit]\n[?]\n\n[Verse: Kevin McCall]\nSo many beautiful girls everywhere I go\n[?] romantic\n'Cause I'll never let them go\nYeah I don't see nothing wrong\n'Cause there's plenty love to throw around\n\n[Hook: Kevin McCall]\nOnly got one heart\nSo many girls I love\nCan't make my mind\nThis time can take me time but I\nCan't keep falling in love\nWith all of y'all\nKeep falling in love\nWith all of y'all\nKeep falling in love\nWith all of y'all\nBut if I could, I would\nMake you all mine"}]}
