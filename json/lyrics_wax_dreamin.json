Run of the mill\nYou rhyme for days and ain't one of em ill\nI know you dyin' for praise comin' from someone with skill\nBut if you were dying of AIDS, I'd make fun of you still\nBut let me talk to the listeners, enough about you\nBefore you play the album, this is what you gotta do:\nYou gotta hit some more medical and pick up more edibles\nAnd hit the liquor store and pick up six or more whatever\nYou choose and press play\nIt couldn't get no more incredible\nYou gonna fuck with it like it was your genitals\nI'm an extra terrestrial with an extra set of testicles\nTo make an effort that's respectable, best eat your vegetables\nIf you still skeptical, I will question you about your dad\nWas he wild?\nDid he beat you really bad as a child?\nWere you scarred by the switches?\nBig Wax drop shit hard on you bitches\nStomach in knots, you wanna barf with the quickness\nDon't trust that fart you will shart in your britches\nCan I get a witness? Testify, heathens\nMix the tap water with extra dry Seagram's\nI wish the best for my legions of people believin and\nDreamin of what they wanna be\nI wish upon em prosperity\nBut I wouldn't recommend that they become an emcee\nThem cyant fuck with me, me drop too heavy\nLike the diddly diddly diddly diddly D. RIP\nUh, hear me now\nIt's Big Wax always all up in your ear canal\nI might not be here in a year from now\nSo this year I'mma dream out loud\n\nDreamin dreamin\nDreamin dreamin\nDreamin...\nNah, I gotta say one more thing to the fucking doubters\n\nMotherfucker your bitch ass I will outperform\nI will crush up your dreams into powdered form\nAnd put the powder on your girls lower spine\nChop it up start blowin lines while I fuck the ho from behind\nAnd realize that in that moment of time I'm blowin her mind and blowin your mind\nWe ain't similar kinds\nAn example of two different species\nYou on the level of a sample of some pigeon feces\nY'all sweet like cinnamon apple or a twix or reeses\nI am an individual who will smack you into bits and pieces\nSick since the fetus, bout to get rich quick and become a rich prick elitist\nBoating in Ibiza with a frozen margarita\nGot your ho in a bikini steady strokin' on my penis\nYelling at that bitch for dripping some lotion on my Adidas\nMaking her clean it but as she does she says\nIt's everything I dreamed it'd be\nCome along and dream with me\nPay attention to the scenery\nDream with me, dream with me\nDun da dun da dun dreamin dreamin\nDreamin dreamin\nDreamin dreamin\nDreamin dreamin", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9f1f0d73852f3d1ccd605ba20019074d.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "Continue...", "title": "Dreamin\u2019"}]}
