You! Get off my cloud!\nYou don't know me and you don't know my style!\nLa La, La-La-La-La, La La La-La, La-La-La-La\nI just came to dance and get wild\nDrink with my girls and party for a while\nLa La, La-La-La-La, La La La-La, La-La-La-La\n\n[Verse 2]\nNeed to inhale and suck it all in\nGet ready y'all 'cause this joints 'bout to spin\nThe Neptunes laced this beat with a trend\nNot sure what this is but it's something sparkling\n\nHe's dancing close he's got my body working\nI'm feeling good, and I can't help flirting\nBartender just filled his last glass of gin\nI think he likes me, Well, at least I'm hoping\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Hook]\nWe can dance if you want now baby [x4]\nWe can leave if it gets too crazy [x4]\n\n[Bridge]\nIf you don't know what you want\nI can show you now baby\nI will be your fantasy\nYou can always count on me\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Hook x2]"}], "artist": "Kelis"}
