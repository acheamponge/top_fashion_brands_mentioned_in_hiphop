This is real oh my God\nCan you imagine livin' in a city so fierce\nNo police better hand than your own, God\nCan you imagine this is where the kids don't dance\nGrowin' up to be roughnecks, my God\nCan you imagine this is where we come from, come from, come from, come from"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
