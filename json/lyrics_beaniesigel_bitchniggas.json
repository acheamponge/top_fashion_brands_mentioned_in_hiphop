Not even a year ago I was there crack\nSlinging crack on the back of dirty blocks\nWith yall getting my scrape on til the cops rolled up\nThat's was home and I stay dedicated\nBut I saw no numbers\nI guess thats whats yall gon call taking a fall but I'm a man\nSo I set aside the set backs tryed to bounce back got a this rap\nCovered it all from the movies, the videos to fucking these groupies\nEven long money, now these niggas wanna test me\nBut I don't give a fuck, I'm feeling like William H.Bonnie  tonight\nWho wanna make the papers I could make ya famous\nGo for your guns, start the ignition how many of yall gon ride to night\nNOT TO MANY NIGGAS!
