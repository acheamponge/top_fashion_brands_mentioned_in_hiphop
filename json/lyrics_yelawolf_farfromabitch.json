Little babies, go to school, don't pout and cry\nSo sick that I make sick sick\nStick dick in a bitch with slit wrist\nJust to get a quick fix, sip syrup - sip fix\nHurry get a twit pic, I'm on! (Yeah, I'm on)\nAnd you gon' smell my cologne (I'm on)\nSome Issey Miyake or some Bond No. 9 (Yeah, I'm on)\nYeah\n\n[Chorus: Big HUD]\nI'm far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho\nCatch me posted on the block like I'm a Valero\nPut that dagger in your heart like a bow and arrow\nSomebody had to lose, I guess that's how to game go (Yeah)\nThe game go, I guess that's how the game go\nI'm far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho (Yeah)\nMy main ho, I put that on my main ho\nI'm far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho\n\n[Verse 2: Rittz]\nShe know that I'm a pro and I don't even got to tell her\nWhite bitch looking like Sarah Michelle Gellar\nGot her tipsy on vanilla\nGhetto one she say she wanna get to know me better\nI said it, I could read her mind, she like an open letter\nNext thing you know I had her face against a feather pillow\nIn a cheap hotel yelling at her while I drill her\nLike a jack hammer, almost flacked in her\nTap-tap-tappin' that ass like a tap dancer\nThen I skeeted, told that bitch to leave or I'ma backhand her\nI'm just playing baby, I don't really act in that manner\n'Cause my game so suave, I ain't scared of cakin' on a lady\nEspecially when she give a great blowjob\nWe can go to dinner, Stoney River steak, go park\nMartini bar, swear it ain't no prob'\nNow just keep your mouth shut 'bout us\nNow hush, you don't wanna piss my main ho off\n\n[Chorus: Big HUD]\nI'm far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho\nCatch me posted on the block like I'm a Valero\nPut that dagger in your heart like a bow and arrow\nSomebody had to lose, I guess that's how to game go (Yeah)\nThe game go, I guess that's how the game go\nI'm far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho (Yeah)\nMy main ho, I put that on my main ho\nI'm far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho\n\n[Verse 3: Struggle]\nI ain't a killer but don't push me\nMy money run long like John Holmes in the pussy\nMarried to these streets, I got a cocaine wife\nThey say the folk ain't right\nLeave my momma alone and blame my life\nIf Kenny Powers fucked Griselda Blanco I'd be they son\nWith a hundred grand\nStill claiming kids that ain't mine to get that tax refund\nTen food stamp cards in my pocket, shit, none of 'em mine\nSlumerican pie, subliminal criminal crimes ahead of my time\n\n[Chorus: Big HUD]\nI'm far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho\nCatch me posted on the block like I'm a Valero\nPut that dagger in your heart like a bow and arrow\nSomebody had to lose, I guess that's how to game go (Yeah)\nThe game go, I guess that's how the game go\nI'm far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho (Yeah)\nMy main ho, I put that on my main ho\nI'm far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho", "title": "Far From a Bitch"}]}
