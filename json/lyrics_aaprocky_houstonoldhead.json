Where the welcome mat? My sneaker tough\nThis is for my old head go on turn your speakers up\nRocky, where you been? I been tryna make my ends meet\nSo I can cop that Bathing Ape or Jeremy Scott or 10 Deep\nBottles full of Rose, riding in the Benz jeep\nBlowing money fast, now I'm finna think I'm Big Meech\nI met with my old head we sat for a while\nWe rolled a couple swishers, we chat for a while\nI said I'm just on my grind I come to Houston all the time\nHe said what's been goin' down in your New York state of mind\nFine, you ever got days you feel like giving up\nLike how you gon' eat when this gig is up\nWhen the chips is down and the jig is up\nBut I don't give a fuck, roll another swisher up\nCause I just came here down South so I could get these pounds out\nAnd move my mother nice somewhere closer than a townhouse\nAnd my beats banging, kicking harder than a roundhouse\nI spoke with my old head and this is what I found out\n\n[Chorus]\nLife is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho\nHoes want the money, money come and goes\nFriends turn to foes, foes they be fake\nIf you listen when ya old head talkin' you'll be straight\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow my old head old age bald head rogaine\nCode red codeine, nose red cocaine\nPimpin bitches since lemon chicken shrimp lo mein\nGold chains afros platforms soul train\nAnd he told me 'bout that rapping trapping in the old days\nWhen Pac hung with Suge before that rat tat tat tat nose rings\nAnd I'm so high I could fuck around and grow wings\nAnd we sipping on something purpler than Soul Plane\nWe sip slow, slow swing, tip foes, and chrome wings\nTold me I should head home and do my own thang\nThen I heard my phone rang, hold up that's my old dame\nPick it up I hit you back, miss me and I miss you back\nShe said Harlem miss you too and they can't wait to get you back\nYou should come on home leave the drugs alone and stick to rap\nJust don't come back flossin' 'cause that type of shit'll get you clapped\n\n[Chorus]\nLife is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho\nHoes want the money, money come and goes\nFriends turn to foes, foes they be fake\nIf you listen when ya old head talkin' you'll be straight", "year": "2011-10-31"}]}
