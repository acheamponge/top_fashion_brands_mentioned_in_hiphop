You say that you ain't got no mayne?\nI'm tryna tell you, girl, I'll let you star on my team\nA play-maker, make a player slow his pace up\nThe type of face a brother wanna see when he wake up\nShe works hard nine to five, sometimes more\nPlus go to school at night, you see she got big goals\nAnd I don't wanna bring you down, I just wanna come along\nMake you moan, make a home, a place that we can both grow old\nSee, let this truth be told, I'm tryna leave that fast life alone\nAnd find a woman of my own\nSo we can get together and build, a foundation that's real\nAnd everyday I'll make you feel like a mill'\n\n[Chorus: Shima & (Mac Mall repeats \"You got me wide open...but you ain't even knowin'\" in the background)]\nYou ain't knowin' that I'm wide open\nYou got me goin' and it's showin' that I want you\nYou ain't feelin' me\nI'm caught up, ba-by\nYou got me slippin' and I'm trippin'\nOff the things you do\n\n[Verse 2:]\nYou think I'm runnin' drag, but I ain't even mad\nI bet you all my cash I'd be the realest that you had\nI wanna treat you lav', but you can't see that half\nI'm tryna keep you smilin' if you just give me a chance\nAt times you make me laugh, you got me wide open\nYou think it's all a front, swear you ain't even knowin'\nIf I was runnin' drama on ya\nI woulda been in the wind, baby, hittin' corners\nInstead I'm standin' right beside you like you know I'm 'posed to\nKeepin' composure, while most fools be in your face just tryna get over\nI see you know my style, me and my vibe is wild\nI hear your friends say I'm not trustworthy\nBut if you wait a while, I'd shut that madness down\nProve to you once and for all that I'm deservin'\nOf your heart, your mind, your soul, your body, your time\nIf it's cool, boo, then give me a sign\nNow I ain't tryna rush you but ASAP\nKeep a Mac on your mind and holla at me\nI say ain't tryna rush you but ASAP\nKeep a Mac on your mind and holla at me\n\n[Bridge: Shima]\nSee, I've been waitin' all my life\nTo find someone like you\nAnd now that you're finally here with me\nThere's no time to lose\nYou're on my mind seven days a week\nNo matter what they say\n'Cause even though your style is wild\nI like the way you do your thing\nBaby, I'm wide open, too\nI'm lovin' me some you\nBaby, I'm wide open, too\nI'm lovin' me some you\n\n[Chorus (Repeat until end)]", "year": "1999-03-23", "album": "Illegal Business 2000", "title": "Wide Open"}], "artist": "Mac Mall"}
