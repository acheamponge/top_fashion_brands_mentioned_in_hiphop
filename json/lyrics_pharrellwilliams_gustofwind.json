(Can I stow away girl, girl?)\nColourful winds of the northern sky\nIs the closest thing, and here is why\nCause we're color\nYou blow me away (blow me away girl, girl)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]\nI need it like I breathe it\nMusic and colors can make one hover\nWho cares if they don't see you?\nDon't you know that they're the same?\nI need it like I breathe it\nIf you never discover, forever you'll suffer\nWho cares if they don't see you?\nYou gotta tap in and learn the way\n\n[Chorus: Daft Punk]\nLike a gust of wind\nYou head me off sometimes\nLike a gust of wind\nYou push me back every once in a while\nLike a gust of wind\nYou remind me there's someone up there\nWho ushers in\nThe air I need to power my sail\n\n[Post-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]\nWhen I open the window\nI wanna hug you\nCause you remind me of the air\nI said yeah\nCause when I'm feelin' real low\nI remember I love you\nI put my hands in the air\nAnd you were there\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Pharell Wiliams]\nWhen I first saw you, I got excited\nTried to keep my composure, tryna hide it\nBut I didn't know\nI didn't let it go\nThen I realized I'm trying to fight it\nJust so they can learn to ride it\nBut I didn't know, oh\nI had to let it go\n\n[Chorus: Daft Punk and Pharrell Williams]\nLike a gust of wind\nYou head me off sometimes\nLike a gust of wind\nYou push me back every once in a while\nLike a gust of wind\nYou remind me there's someone up there\nWho ushers in\nThe air I need to power my sail\n\n[Post-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]\nWhen I open the window\nI wanna hug you\nCause you remind me of the air\nI said yeah\nCause when I'm feelin' real low\nI remember I love you\nI put my hands in the air\nAnd you were there", "year": "2014-03-03"}]}
