Doctors and lawyers? Cause we ain't seeing builders, but seeing plenty destroyers\nAnd music only annoy us, this viper is like made of poison\nIt shoot like, Brandon Roy with this boy, you shouldn't toy with this\nHot for a minute, then you gone like it's boilers\nThis boy'll hurt any, no pity when he getting berserk\nSpoiler alert: The wickedest prick, or get them urked\nThen sit with a smirk, cause they thinking little like a smurf\nIt's my turf, wish you the worst if you step in it\nGet out of my section, I'm setting up for a bunch of wins\nRemember I was tumbling, just trying to get up again\nThen I started buzzing, went light-years in front of them\nFuck getting a Woody, the Grammy's I gotta get em in\nThe rap act, catch em this cat is been wrecking em\nThese lines help me paint, and y'all niggas still sketching em\nI'm still ill, with niggas' chicks they not threatening\nI never learned my lesson, and I guess I never will\nCause I tried to change tomorrow, but the past'll run a mill\nLike the last deal, that I went and did with Mass Appeal\nThey can't believe in a nigga, so I know nobody feel\nCause they ain't believe in Martin, and they ain't believe in Malcolm\nTook two different routes, still they found the same outcome\nSo fuck it if they doubt, son\nImma be outstanding\nI'm already ready for the climb, like mountains\nNo he reeking, believe I got the loud and\nMountain OC for the tree and the rounding\nNow I'm OD, and it's seeking around\nAnd still I'm never weak and my vision ain't clouding\nThey sneak, so they clowning, but you'll witness the Emperor\nMy words'll give em chills, like a Christian in a minister\nKilling like, sinister\nNiggas quite, miniature\nShip em like, visitors\nAnd them light, prisoners\nI just do what I do, like signatures\nWe not similar, Imma pop like it's finisher\nGot the kind of lines to strain a mind, trivia\nLetting niggas slide, now it's time to get ridaya\nRidaya, ridaya"}], "artist": "Bishop Nehru"}
