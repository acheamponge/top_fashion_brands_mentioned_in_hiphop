Wait a minute!\n\n[Chorus:]\nIf you act nice, you can get it\nIf you act right, you can get it\nIf you want my love, better win it\nIf you want my love, better win it\nIf you all lies then forget it\nIf you uptight then forget it\nIf you want my love, better win it\nIf you want my love, better win it\nWait a minute! Wait minute!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2:]\nAll these boys, I call them actors\nWinning Oscars\nThey say they love us\nBut they actually imposters\nDon't want no player\nThat's why I fired my roster\nI told my man of the future\nThat he got to be\nBe my Prince Charming\nKind of gentle, kind of ghetto\nDon't want no man\nThat be softer than that Jello\nDon't want no puppet\nCause my name ain't Gepetto\nWant to win it? Treat me special!\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nYo!\nAin't no speeding\nAin't no zoom zoom\nYou can take me on a date\nUnder the moon, moon\nIf we kiss, it's gon' later\nNever soon, soon\nYou can get a Ukelele\nPlay my tune, tune\nPlay a sad song\nYou think I'm easy, huh\nAnd now you mad, huh\nYou think I'm teasing, huh\nBut I ain't teasing you\nNo, I told you right from the start\nIf you roll with my love\nYou better win my heart\n\n[Chorus]\n\nWait a minute!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e1084bb63f18114330899421f08ac629.1000x1000x1.png", "year": "2013-07-13", "title": "Zoomin\u2019 Zoomin\u2019", "album": "Play it Again - EP"}]}
