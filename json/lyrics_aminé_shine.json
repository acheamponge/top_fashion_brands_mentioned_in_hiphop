Where's the evidence?\nShould I even bother? I guess that's confidence\nWe sippin' sake soakin' sun so sofa's never comfy\nSo sorry summer's over but you still my lil' mami\nI wake up, then get up, graveyard shift 'til 5\nYou stay up, then we fuck, you always down to ride\nWhen she do the tip drill, throw it like a pinwheel\nMy problems only minor, nonexistent like a kids' will\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't wanna feel like I need ya\nYou're a catch but I'm not a receiver\nI'm nervous what this might turn into\nKnow my skin glows whenever I see ya\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's why I'm shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin'\nThat's why I'm shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin'"}]}
