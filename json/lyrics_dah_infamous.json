{"songs": [{"lyrics": "Please don't think cause I smoke a lil more than a lot that I'm slipping\nAny point in time a nigga tripping\nAbout fifteen deep, me and my gang of misfits\nWe been smoking, we been sipping, and we looking for the mischief\nMy word is bond, we keep it calm as long as you play it cool\nJust like the breeze, inhaling weed, exhaling jewels\nLike the logo on my hooded sweatshirt\nNiggas bitches giving head until they fucking necks hurt\nCouldn't please her, now she skeezing, know you did your best work\nFor what it's worth the haze was just a phase, more sour, more purp\nJust stay one up on your pimping, stay out other niggas business\nRoll and smoke up on ya winnins, only worrying 'bout them digits\nDo you feel me?", "album": "Caveman Files", "year": "2011-03-15", "title": "Infamous", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8364eac38f8e9f936d9169b02883e6b0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Da$H"}
