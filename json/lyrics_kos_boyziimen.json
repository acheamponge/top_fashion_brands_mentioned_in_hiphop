Intro] [Alan Watts]\nNow I\u2019m sure most of you know the old story\nAbout the astronaut who went far out into space\nAnd was asked on his return\nWhether he had been to heaven and seen God\nAnd he said yes\nAnd so they said to him, \"Well, what about God?\"\nAnd he said, \"Well, she\u2019s black.\"\nAnd although this is a very well known and well-worn story, it is very profound\nBecause i tell you\n\n[Verse 1]\nGo ahead meddle in the melanin\nBlack man, black woman, black baby\nBlack man, white woman, black baby\nWhite man, black woman, black baby\nNah I ain't racist but the numbers

spitting in an old cup\nI don't need y'all movement I\u2019ll be\nHere until your grand kids get gray hairs\nHit the spots like sun in the air\nGoing hard like i owe four months rent in arrear\nSee my Papa was a rolling stone i began cheif walk the block\nNot I'm just rolling my own\nFull steam down the hill everything up front\nGetting smoked is like a fat ass blunt\n\n[Verse 3]\nI\u2019m up
