Yes I can\nGet that Chet Magnific\nI got it goin' on like Miami got heat\nI pay to keep eight days a week\nMy name is on your lips so keep hatin' on me\nCause I got the feature\nI got the beat you\nTry to repeat\nK, run after me\nCause I'm busy and my phone's ringing off the hook\nSo I look both ways whichever way I strut\nOr stumble. Imma stay humble, it's the main thang\nFirst _________ if you wanna maintain\nBig things, big chains, big pay\nPeak game, peak game, OK\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo, I started at a lounge, rhyming on a couch\nWith my money in my mind and my mic-ing in my mouth\nAnd I didn't know how life could change styles\nWhen up came a suit like, \"Can we meet tomorrow?\"\nShocked at first like a tremor in the Earth\nBut I played it so cool, I played it so curtsy\nFor what it's worth, Bath & Body Works\nThough my uncle make the three drop back ain't hurt\nI got scurred when I first got word\nThat Tamika's got beef when I first got heard\nKickin with some ______ so hard, so sure\nBubba says girls get kicked to the curb\nOn the double, don't move my levels\nThe crowd goes wild when the EQ doubles\nThe bass, the bass, the treble, the treble\nThe bass, the bass, the treble, the treble\n\n[Hook]"}]}
