I know you heard about that, still a dope boy got birds on deck\nTalking parakeets though, cause you a stool pigeon know you can't wait to run and spread the word bout that\nAnd I never will let 'em, a pussy nigga keep me from being dope boy fresh\nAnd they ain't gon' get it cause it is nigga, you can bet the bank on that\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nI don't do much talking, let the money do it for me\nAnd I don't need no promo, cause the haters do it for me\nI just tell it how it is, while they be telling stories\nWhen you come up from the bottom, that just mean that you was chosen\n(And what it mean when you come up from the bottom?)\nThat just mean that you was chosen\nAnd I don't need no promo, cause the haters do it for me\nI just tell it how it is, while they be telling stories\nWhen you come up from the bottom, that just mean that you was chosen\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nI can bet every chain on every verse I ever wrote, on every phrase on every note\nNo wedding ring, but I'm married though to the game for forever more\nYou in the game but you never score, in every lane I'm exceptional\nI'm on a plane where you never go\nAnd they tell me that life is a bitch but I much prefer mary jane as a better ho\nAye, you see most of y'all niggas just fake to me, stories made up like Maybelline\nMy niggas good for life, y'all still trying to get from point A to B\nAnd they say silence is golden, so my wrist be talking shit for me\nAnd haters can't help but hate, shit I can't help but be chosen\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\n\n[Verse 3: Spodee]\nA up on my fitted cap, my momma told me always give the critics (snap)\nBalling with the homies they can try and run up on me\nWe gon' start tripping like they invented maps\nJordan's with denim vests, spending more than your mortgage on Vino Pet\nRoll up the cigars, amino fat\nNot so big, hunnits come out the side\nShe ain't sucking dick, she gotta jump out the ride\nAnother one that's choosing, that's the one I'll oblige\nFocus on the money, only vocal for the moment\nNiggas scavenging the hunger, wondering how I survived\nFor them beat the double but the triple\nBurn em like a griddle, play a sucka' nigga like a fiddle\nI don't say a word if I'm a kill em\nSoon as I get the watch, just put em in the Nets Kerry Kittles\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]", "title": "Chosen", "album": "No Genre Pt. 2", "image": "https://images.genius.com/07af9b12b2956baf31b88d2ae47697d2.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
