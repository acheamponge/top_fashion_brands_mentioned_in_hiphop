Behind The Music, believe that I've been through it\nI either write the true shit or feel my life is useless\nYou should, do this, math with me right quick dog\nI cry myself to sleep when the lights get soft\nTour twice, in the spring and the fall\nTen weeks each my son doesn't see me at all\nNow out of 12 months daddy's gone for 5\nSpot dates in the mix, I'm absent for 6\nSo I'm a half ass daddy\nPart time singer\nHalf ass crazy, got my wife feelin' half single\nIn New Jersey, bitchin' with the word play\nAbout how my parents raised me in the worst way possible\nDoin' what I gotta do\nAnd tryin' to get a rap or two\nMissin' my own son's third birthday\nI'm a self centered piece of shit\nStomped down hypocrite\nTryin' to get a grip on it but now I got to live with it\nThis is me motherfucker, I'm a mean mugger\nNot intentionally brother, I was tryin' to see somethin'\nI never drive because I'm legally blind\nAll I can do is describe what I see in my mind\nPeople are fine until they peep a weakness of mine\nThen they fuck me over so I need to leave them behind\nShit's real\nMy wrist is still stiff from my last hook\nCat learned how to scrap just by gettin' his ass whupped\nI'll catch an elbow and that shit will just hurt\nSo I swing mine the next time I get in some dirt\nAnd that works\nAnd that's why Murs is the homie\nBecause the brothers ain't scared to dig out spurs in the moment\nMy recipe for greatness, there is no depleting this\nBecause the active ingredient in it is my weaknesses\nI speak with this little drawl that the Midwest created\nWhen they treat someone like shit for a decade\nAnthony can't chirp, flare or backspin\nBut he'll listen to my fucked up life without laughin'\nI'm challenged and offended by sheets of blank paper\nWho act like they are too good to carry my strange flavor\nPainstakingly, suffice is to say\nI ain't scared to put my motherfuckin' life on display\n\n[Chorus X3]", "year": "2004-05-11", "album": "Champion EP"}], "artist": "Brother Ali"}
