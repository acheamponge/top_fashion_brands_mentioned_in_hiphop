Here\u2019s honest rot\nTo unpick the elaborate heart, pare bone\nFree of the fictive vein. When one stark skeleton\nBulks real, all saints\u2019 tongues fall quiet:\nFlies watch no resurrections in the sun\n\nStare, stare\nTill your eyes foist a vision dazzling on the wind:\nRave on the leash of the starving mind\nThe blank, untenanted air", "album": "ULTRAVIOLET"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
