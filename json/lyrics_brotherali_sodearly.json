I mean .. it's just kinda ..\nI don't know man .. it's just the whole way that happend .. it's just ..\n\n[Verse]\nShe had the brown west african features\nShe was lookin' sweet as peaches\nOn gorgeous spring day\nWith a thing to say\nLittle or no make-up\nCovered her face up\nBut brother when she smiles\nShe light the whole place up\nShe was covered from the waist up\nIn a pastel pink scarf\nShe's soft\nAnd Midas with the way that she talk\nIn my thoughts she kept me company when we\nWe're apart\nEarly on I felt that she would own a piece of my heart\nOut of respect\nI kept the distance in the physical\nBut moved in on the mental and emotional\n'til she seem more approachable\nSo hopefull I had never been casanova\nI had never been\nShe's probablly been approached by better men\nBut then again\nI please the earth-citizen\nShe probablly like religious men\nThat's something that most are conciderin'\nI sat back and thought about it\nThen reflect\nIf I approach her with respect\nOur roads have got to intersect\nAhhh\nIt got deeper said her name\nWas Latifah, \"Glad to meet cha\nHeard you was a preacher\nMaybe later we'll speak\"\nI felt numb, dizzy\nBody tingelin', thinkin' what to say next\nReady to sign over my paychecks\nNo disguise\nOn the blessing\nFrom her eyes\nI was guessin'\nShe had been through\nEnough to know the evil that some men do\nI felt the pain\nI be umbrella in the rain\nBody yell the name\nAfter that I never felt the same\nShe felt warm to me\nHer eyes sang a song to me\nShe long for me\nTo touch her I can feel it\nBut too shy to reveal it\nThe strong attraction started creepin' in\nWe can spin together through the universe\nBut must become a unit first\nWe ain't had money for the big weddin receptions\nBut we had the real commitment\nAnd the priceless connection\nThe mere mention of the name Latifah\nSent me deep into the ocean\nWith no scuba dive suit\nThis girl is potion(?)\nWhen I'm in pain\nAll she has to do is put a hand on me\nY'all ain't understandin' me\nShe: bring out the man in me\nShe: ain't 'fraid to challenge me\nShe: know how to handle me\nWe: go build this a family\nStrong up off reality\nTogether in the Jihad\nWe struggle hard to please god\nWith each and every aspect of life\nWe increase\nAnd with each pass of year\nIt's more and more clear\nThat god is the reason that we're both still here\nIf we follow his directions\nWe're expectin' his protection\nAnd I'm carving out a section\nOf this earth for us to rest in\nI'm strivin'\nI'm never satisfied with just survivin'\nStrivin' to provide a life in which our soul feels alright in\nYou're a priceless diamond\nAt your feet is where the paradise is lying\nEven the nicest rhyme in the world couldn't explain\nThis is just my attempt to document\nThe blessin' that\nWalked into my life one afternoon\nI love you", "year": null, "album": "Rites of Passage"}], "artist": "Brother Ali"}
