Align me holy in the cherry field\nAm I a hero for saving myself?\n\nTelefone tell em' I ain't saved yet\nTelefone tell em' I sat and drank Whiskey\nWith the sun until the day left. Just\nLike papa, just like MF DOOM\n\nIf I'm majestic like a star\nOr a gypsy\nTelefone, why you don't ring no more?\nWho hit me up the other day? Was it a label?\nNo No...just the alarm"}], "artist": "Noname"}
