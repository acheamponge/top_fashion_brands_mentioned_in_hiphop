I don't fuck with bake\nI don't never get stuck with weight\nOpen shot, every smoker wit' a straight, brush my gate\nYou ain't makin' no dough cause you stretchin' your shit\nFuck tryin' to make more, dog, I'm stressin' to flip\nKeep smokers on them red caps, stressin' to hit\nDope fiends with they hair back, catchin' they drip\nI'm tryin' to show you where the bread at. You catchin' my drift?\nBut I see where your head at, you stressin' to bitch\nGive me that hot plate and pyrax pop\nShit, I'll show you how to fire that rock, supply that block\nNow peep how I set up shop, wit' a half a block\nLock down half the block\nTurn that half a block into another half a block\nThen I'll lock down the other half a block....\n\n[Verse 2]\nI don't give a fuck about the chatter in the background\nNever put my straps down, nigga\nThis is Mack Town, nigga\nAsk around, bitch nigga I never was\nKept leather gloves and the 38 tar snub\nOn the real, ya niggas don't know me\nDon't get found in the lake wit' eight shots like Kobe\nIt's the Gouch, what you talkin' bout homie?/\nI'll make your bus stop short like Gary Coleman\n\"I got more pots and strips then you...\" (I make it hot)\n\"....niggas won't even sell nicks to you.\" (not a rock)/\nI spit phrases that'll thrill you\nI got gats wit' clips wit' lasers that'll kill you\nGot myself an uzi brother, nuzi two nines\nThese thugs gon' getcha (getcha), slugs gon' hit cha\n\"I got more gats and tecs than you...\" (I'll make it hot)\n\"... niggas won't even stand next to you\" (I tear the rock)\nWhen I clap down, back down your wack friends\nFor that \"Cash Money,\" pull out \"Mack 10's\"\nIntro tef, I'm twenty-two (uh)\nYou dudes ain't worth it, keep them funny jewels (whoa!)........\n\nI'm so street like asphault\nI spit shit like my ass talk, dog, it's Mack Mittens\nDon't make me raise up and put my hands on you\n??a house sellin raids nigga, I'll put my grams on you??\nMan, I'm so fuckin' deep in the game\nGot one foot to the street, the other feet to the fame\nI'm seesaw, tryin' to balance shit out\nUntil then, I got a six gon' silence shit out\nWanna make the transition, from the street to the fame\nBut I can't let it weaken my game, man listen\nPicture Mac flippin' like a transmission\nLittle nickels, wit' slick fifty's tryin' to stick me\nKnowing one shot from a Glock could stop my injured block\nSo I quickly move, oars like Jiffy Lube\nNever-had-it niggas and half the fact that niggas\nSnortin'-magic niggas or the court rattin' niggas", "image": "https://images.genius.com/84576893bd0396cc4153bf1c32207302.400x400x1.jpg", "year": null, "title": "No Glory", "album": "State Property Soundtrack"}]}
