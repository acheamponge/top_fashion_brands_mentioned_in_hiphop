No one\nI followed my azimuth then transit on a path from apprentice to master\nMy testimony any place at the top is lonely\nAsk me what I cherish mostly, no matter what I say is poetry\nThe way I walk, the way I talk, the way I fought\nThe way I won, the way I lost, the way I thought\nWhen they tried to play me out as a man\nThe way it felt takin' showers in the sand with a fuel can\nWakin' up in the middle of the night\nI can't breathe right, I can feel my heart beat spike\nFather Author, Poor Pauper use to be a war monger\nI promised the Lord I will not tour any longer\nPardon the The Poor Pauper with nothin' to offer from his coffer\nCoughin' up a mouthful of a volcanic sulfur\nFeast your eyes on the awesome mechanics of the metallic saucers\nFlown by man, I bet you thought it was the Martians\nSince Channel Zero I tried to do somethin' to save you\nBut you threw away the jewels I gave you\nWhen you're ready to move to the mountains it'll be too late too\nThat's why I pray for you\nMy words appear clear but true meanin' is lost\nWhy would an emcee like that even talk?\nClear your mind, clear your thoughts\nThrow away everything you bought\nAnd kneel before the Ark\nYOU DON'T! You knew you should but you won't\nAny artist will become lethargic from weed smoke\nI don't go to malls cause I don't like shoppin'\nI can't buy clothes when the mannequins are watchin'\nOverspecialization doesn't require special explanation\nThe information is my interpretation\nI sit down at the table and make it\nThrough a series of musical, lyrical and compositional arrangements\nI'm disinfatuated, you rappers are overrated\nFor the music you're makin', it sounds foolish and basic\nThread by thread the poem is woven, the book is open\nYou were ordered to show him, than the words are spoken\nCivilization is fragile, so is life there in battle\nSo is nature when surrounded by the unnatural\nWalk through the doors of Langley Headquarters\nMy logo is in the floor etched in marble\nBehind the rose line, morals and dogma of rhymes\nThat climb one of three peaks of Mount Hermon there in my lifetime\nThe rhymes is 3 point 1 4 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9\nSame morning that the Can-I-Bus album came out\nI got a text from The NSA that said \"They'd take me out\"\nKabbalah Math was all I had\nMy wife and child were both killed in a helicopter crash\nEight months passed, I'm in Walter Reed with a rare fungus rash\nI told them \"Fuck the cash\" Just give me somethin' for the pain\nMy brain 'bout to bust vein\nThey said \"You've been through enough Germaine\"\nI tried to sit up but can't get up\nThis sucks, Father Author, Poor Pauper can't give up\nThe Biomarker lit up; the labtec took the blood that I spit up\nShe tried to screen it, than clean it\nHydroxide radicals I couldn't believe it\nI was the Anemic Heathen that was saved by the blood of Jesus\nMy only grievance is I never be the same again\nNever be able to rhyme like it was '98 again\nI'm so ashamed I'm depressed; I don't know what I could say to them\nSo I made this mixtape for them\nI hope you enjoy it even if you never bought it\nThis is Father Author, Poor Pauper last recording"}]}
