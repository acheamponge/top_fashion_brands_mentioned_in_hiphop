Got lyrics by the boatload\nGot beats like you don\u2019t even know, though\nCouldn\u2019t copy my steez even if you worked at Kinko\u2019s\nI think, though, faster than you think, though\nMake moves faster than Plinko, slap the bass\nBlow the horns, and it ain\u2019t safe, rough patch\nNo time for a nap, my mind gone\nSpeeding through traffic, pass all the hasslers\nLike, [?], peace to [?]\nThe world didn\u2019t have to do that to you, you drop dimes like a stitch\nI drop dimes like I\u2019ma make you rich\nHere\u2019s a plan, stay out of my way\nAnd I\u2019ll put the whack to sleep like tryptophan\nStay out of my way and I\u2019ll change the game\nNow, how\u2019s that for [?], mane?\n\n[Verse 2: Kool A.D.]\nAyo, spit \u2018em, boy\n[?] zooted\nToo stupid, Amaze 88\nThe dude looped this, same hand that he hoop with\nCount the loot with, steer the coupe with\nBro, we in the building and we near where the roof is\nYo, I appear where the truth is\nSee how the fear drink the juices\nOf the soul\nThe foolish wanna know all the boolish details\nWhile others cop it wholesale and move it retail\nAnd drown they sorrows in the coochie and females\nI burn like the grooviest trees\nMailed to me through indubious means\nWait, what\u2019s indubious mean? Scratch that\nMake it dubious means, man, this doobie is mean\nMan, it\u2019s truly obscene how I move through unruliest dreams\nAnd I truly come clean\nLike [?] did, I\u2019m nice when I do this\nI\u2019m twice more than too sick, that\u2019s like four\nYou nice? I\u2019m nice more\nWe eating, mane\nLike we just ran up inside the rice store\nMore shine than an ice store, get your mind right\nGet aligned with the life force, ain\u2019t nothing sweet\nLike diabetes, type 4, that\u2019s my word\nYo, the fuck I gotta lie for?\nWe major, you minor, sucker"}]}
