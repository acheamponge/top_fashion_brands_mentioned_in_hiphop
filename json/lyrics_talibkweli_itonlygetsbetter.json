The world won't wait for you, you gonna take it now\nYou gonna make a vow\nAs long as you on planet earth put family first got to make 'em proud\nHey, let me break it down, oh, bless your hearts\nKeep talking bout how stressed you are\nBetter talk about how blessed you are\n\n(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)\nLord knows I had it hard today\nHad it hard today\nStill I gotta keep my head up high along the way\nCause it only gets better, better\nIt only gets better from here\nIt only gets better, better\nIt only gets better from here\n\n(Bridge 2:  Marsha Ambrosius)\nEvery day I got to get up early, wake the kids\nGet on running made again\nGo to work watching in\nEvery day I\u2019m hustling\nFight the traffic, lose my cool\nGet the kids up at the school\nLife it\u2019s hard, yeah, that\u2019s true\nThis is what I have to do\n\n(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)\nCause it only gets better, better\nIt only gets better from here\nIt only gets better, better\nIt only gets better from here\n\n(Verse 2: Talib Kweli)\nWalk with God be still and listen\nTry to talk to God what's real I\u2019m spitting\nCall 'em Christ by name but he still ain\u2019t rising\nSet to my lane but still ain\u2019t listening\nGot ice in the veins remain so frigid\nStill in the kill brain cells when you hit it\nOrder pills when you pop that, pop that, pop that\nDon\u2019t stop, get it, get it\nStarted, we the fighters, we survivors but we ain\u2019t living\nMy soul is blacker than the Friday after Thanksgiving\nPeople of colour 25% more likely than whites to face prison\nBut just because the president is black there\u2019s no more racism?\nPost-racial? More like most racial\nThe hate for you disgraceful\nDon\u2019t let it take you off your base, let it motivate you\nDon\u2019t let it overtake you, so what another cloud\nSurvive the storm by riding on the beasts of the southern wild\nWow\n\n(Hook: Marsha Ambrosius)\nLord knows I had it hard today\nHad it hard today\nStill I gotta keep my head up high along the way\nCause it only gets better, better\nIt only gets better from here\nIt only gets better, better\nIt only gets better from here\n\nMemories live, man, and my memories stay alive..\n(more talk)"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
