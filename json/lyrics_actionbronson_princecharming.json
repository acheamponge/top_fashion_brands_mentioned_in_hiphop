A strange sense, ah\nSomething's going wrong, I can feel it in my fingers, man, shit\nA strong scent lingers\nSomething's going wrong, I can feel it in my fingers\nLike arthritis when it's raining, uh\n\n[Bridge]\nLet it rain on me\nLet it rain\nUh, it's me\nOn me\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt only took me nine times to make a debut, tenth time's a charm, shit (True)\nNow man\u2019s on road, that means I'm hard\nCharge whatever on the Visa card, half moon Caesar parts\nA lot of motherfuckers blind, they couldn't see the art\nWar stories, throw 'em through a stack of tables\nWrap my body in a stack of Bibles \u2018cause shit could get dangerous\nBam Bam splash off the turn buckle (Splash)\nNow you no longer have to use your nerves or muscles\nWe'll see who loves me if I need a liver, shit\nYou feel defenseless in the presence of a stripper (Shit)\nYou cannot be trusted with the access to the money\nI crash more Benzes than when they practice with the dummies\nI make these bastards look funny, Bugs Bunny, pussy\nI make these bastards look funny, Bugs Bunny (Bugs Bunny)\nUh, yeah, these motherfuckers must be crazy, \u2018cause I ain't going nowhere\nUntil I'm called up to the stars, then I'll go there\nUntil then, I'm back here to live another life\nBut for now I'm asking ladies like \"What's up tonight?\"\nBaby, what's up tonight?\nYeah, what's up tonight?\n\n[Outro]\nI got the True Religion jean suit\nG-Unit sneaker shit\nAh", "title": "Prince Charming", "album": "White Bronco", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ac4a689fba4e0dd9edc54358061eb06a.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2018-10-19"}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
