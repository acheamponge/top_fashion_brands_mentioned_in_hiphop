IamSu!]\nLivin' under stars, tryna shine like them\nBumpin' the College Dropout, tryna rhyme like him\nBumpin' Aftermath shit, tryna rhyme like Em\nDrinkin' until I'm bent like a duck bill brim\nI wanna be the greatest, I don't know how to say this\nBut I would die before I'd be the one that didn't make it\nStarin' in the mirror tryna find a deeper meaning\nOf why I beat the sun, hung on morning and the evening\nCause I'm star gazin', tryna figure out how you got there\nThe top blare, Jay-Z, no Rockwell\nBut I keep a bad b with me\nThe same ones that starved with me finna eat with me\nThe same ones that came with me finna leave with me\nIt sounds simple but got complicated recently\nCause you take a lot of losses, tryna be a winner\nClimbin' up the ladder of success with no splinters\nIt's hard but it's real\nI'm from where people die just to live\nSo I give my whole heart in the real\nJust to spark the young mind of a kid\nTo do it big like Frank White, swagged up, game tight\nI just wanna shine and give all of ya'll the same light back\nSo when I'm on stage doing my thing\nApply that to your life man, hah\n\n[Bridge]\nBest thing yet\nTo ever come into my life, life\n\n[Outro: Kool John]\nYeah\nYou already  know who it is\nThe one and only\nMis Shmoop Obama, David Huffer and Kool John\nLiving that Shmoop life, um\nGod works in mysterious ways\nI always found the beauty in growth\nSeeing the process of growing  nothing to something\nIs truly amazing\nGod blessed me with a vision\nTo forsee things, I knew, you know\nI knew, all I had to do was folow my intuection\nAnd apply myself\nAnd it would get me to where I wanna be\nYou know, It go a couple years back\nYou know what I'm saying\nWhen Iamsu and I\nWe were going to the same GM college\nHe was giving me a ride to work\nCause I had car problems, And\nI remember him  explaining to me that he did music\nUm, so me being a music head lover and a music head\nYou know, I did my research and dug him up\nUm, i instantly copped the rhyming\nAnd came across some IamSu freestyles\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing\nI was like my young nigga out here\nReally like tearing up tracks and shit\nLike that, like, he better than any nigga out here right now\nMajor niggas, professional niggas and even undergound niggas\nI was like, eh, eh man, I gotta heear more of this bro\nI gotta here more, so i came\nI became more interested\nWhat you doing with this music shit\nSo he invited me to Chief House, you know\nOne of his buddies, he had a little studio\nSet up in his bedroom\nAnd I started coming over and hanging around\nAnd listen to these original tracks,that IamSu was recording\nAnd producing himself  and you know\nHe had  his other you know, his  fellow producers\nInvasion Beats, P-Lo, Kuya and Chief, you know what I mean\nI was just, like, crazy, like, like,woah\nLike these guys are developing  a new sound\nThat I ain't never heard before\nAnd, um, I even became more amazed, you know what I'm saying\nThe talent, that this young man, possessed, you know what I'm saying\nConsistent quality, and the music he was making, you know what I'm saying\nIAnd around that time I was throwing these parties across Shmop fest\nI was throwing this little promotional company called Equippy Cool thing promotions\nAnd wanted to climb the youth of promotional skills\nSeeing something grow form the ground up\nSo, I'm listening to these IamSu tracks\nAnd I'm just puzzled and baffled at the fact that\nNo, Nobody knwos at this time, the individual existed, you know what I'm saying\nSo, from then on\nI was like, I'm gonna do whatever in my power to help this guy get started, you know what I'm saying\nSo, I got as many blank CD's  as I can\nIt was probably like 8 discs\nI told him, I'm gonna get you in these streets\nSo, I make sure everyone I know, know about you, you know what I'm saying\nSo, so I know a lot of people and you know\nA lot of people come and ask me, you know what I'm saying\nYo, you got any  more mixes?\nCause you make these dope party mixes\nAnd these dope slow slow jam mixes\nI started putting 'Su on the playlist\nAnd they like , you know\nAnd they wanted to start catching on\nSo, you know, And um\nAnd from then on, this is one talented young man\nThis nigga can really rap, you know\nYou know what I'm saying\nWho is this nigga?\nYou know what I'm saying\nYou know I wanted to convince everyone\nYou know what I'm saying\nThat he was the future\nAnd I want them to see what I see\nSo, I see he future in this style\nI see the future in his rap and his beats\nYou know what I'm saying\nANd everyone, you now\nLike I thought they would catch on\nYou know what I'm saying\nI'm seeing IamSu grow and transform  into the greatest artist\nEach  project, you know what I'm saying\nHe getting better and better  and um\nAnd it became motivating and inspiring\nYou know what I'm saying,you know what I'm saying\nI literally seen, no one was fucking with him\nTo him being the man now,you know what I'm saying\nAnd, um, I've seen him apply himself\nAnd you know and ur\nAnd watch him move and grow infront of my eyes\nSo that I knew I could do the same, you know what I'm saying\nHe kept his fans and teams loyal\nAnd kept his fans tight\nAnd all that shit, and ur\nI was really happy to see a young man doing that for himself, you know what I'm saying\nAnd to go after what he love and to take his music seriously\nNow, you know\nNow here we are, couple years later ,you know\nIamSu's the hottest and the world is noticing his art\nAnd all I can say is, I knew\nYou know what I'm saying, I knew\n\n[Musical Interlude]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f17798f733b204f275cb24133e9d98e.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "Kilt 2", "year": null}]}
