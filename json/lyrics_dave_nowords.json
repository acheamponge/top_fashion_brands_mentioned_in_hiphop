Where's your mandem?\nOn Insta, sitting in a mad whip\nIn traffic, man are looking like a catfish\nFake youts, plastic\nStop acting, man are all average\nMy girl got a body boombastic\nElastic, call her Mrs Fantastic\n\n[Verse 4: MoStack]\nLike ooh, pull up in a car, I cruise\nHopped out cool, nice move\nWhy she wanna know? When I said I'm with a star\nShe just turned around and she said \"who?\"\nTook her home with us, that's standard\nShe wanna roll with us, that's standard\nNiggas getting paid, that's standard\nThis Mo and Dave, that's bangers\n\n[Chorus: Dave]\nI don't wanna dead no beef\nI don't wanna sort it out\nI don't wanna hear no words\nI don't wanna talk it out\nI don't wanna dead no beef\nI don't wanna sort it out\nI don't wanna hear no words\nI don't wanna talk it out", "year": "2017-11-03"}], "artist": "Dave"}
