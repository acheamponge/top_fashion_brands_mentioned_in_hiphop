Yeah\nPass the weed motherfucker!\nHey Mr. babysitter would you look at all them ashes?\nThe blunt's going out, is you ever gonna pass it?\nRat bastard it's always you\nSneaking extra hits--I wanna get high too!\nDon't lie fool, I see it in your eye\nAight--how come I don't look that high?\nCause you've been smoking more than I\n(Hey man we need some more weed!)\nHmm I wonder why?\nHey man what's this all on it? Slob?\nNigga, quit giving the blunt a blowjob\nAlways cutting, trying to show stop\nOh you get an extra hit just because we at your spot?\nI need some more pot cause this ain't kosher\nCall Rich the Factor cause I need dozier\nMan you know what? You can take your Swisher Sweet to the face\nI'mma go get me a Backwood and roll me an eighth\n\n[Hook (x2):]\nHit it two times and pass\n(Can I smoke with you?)\nHit it two times and pass\n(That's what you're supposed to do)", "year": "2004-07-20", "album": "The Genie of The Lamp", "title": "2 Times and Pass"}], "artist": "Mac Dre"}
