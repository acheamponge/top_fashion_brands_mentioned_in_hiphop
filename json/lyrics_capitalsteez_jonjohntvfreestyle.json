I told them listen and chill\nI ain't even gotta mention the skill\nBecause STEEZ been ahead since he popped out the momma's womb\nAnd had it locked since they put me in my papa's tomb\nI was 3 years old, so I really don't remember the day but I remember his face\nAnd every night I still remember to pray\nAnd remember it's the little mistakes that made me spit it this way\nIt's like taliban when I'm dropping bombs, going line for line\nSpitting this shit fasting, it's ramadan\nWhen my pen-cil sets sail, Any beat they put on is getting smoked like Big L\nWe up on a rise like the cajuns, cooly haired nigga with the eyes of a asian\nBlazin, trapped in a mind full of hatred\nPops was a rasta and mom was a pagan\nMy man had to get up out of this place now he living in PA, dawg wherever you safe\nBut, around here niggas die everyday, I wouldn't lie to your face\nCome back and light up a J, man!\nShit, I got the whole town to hold down\nWhen we get on I'm blowing down a whole pound\nI know you see me shutting shows down\nAnd we pickin up hoes now\nIt's going down\n\n[Jon John]\nUh, let them know who you be, pimpin\n\n[Capital STEEZ]\nIt's Capital STEEZ, man AK47, say no more\nShouts out to the homie Jon John\nWe just did this show opening up for Mac Miller\nIt's crazy, my biggest performance yet\nIt's world domination"}]}
