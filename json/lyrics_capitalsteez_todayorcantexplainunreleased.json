Nigga I'm the best don't forget it .....all It it took was 13 steps and I did it}\n\n{And today I got a feeling that I\u2019ve never felt\nAnd I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know what to say And today I got a feeling like not before\nAnd I guess I can\u2019t I guess I can\u2019t I guess I can\u2019t explain}\n\n{We was born to be a step ahead shit they got the system doing systems we got the system that turned us into Victims my moms was living with 8 children and section 8 is still trying to evict them\nSaid look at the world we\u2019re here living in\nI\u2019m too proud to blend it in with law abidin citizens\nIt\u2019s cuz I\u2019m black is it.. and the characteristics of your last statistic\nMassa said I couldn\u2019t define happiness and my master said I couldn\u2019t pass as a pacifist\nI dealt with more bank than the Mexicans did\nIon back tears like a handkerchief}\n\n{I said I wanna be a rap star\nPorn stars, black cars and fast cars\nFuck Ferrari\u201ds bacardi and parties I wanna change the world I'm awfully sorry\nAnd I can even be the next Bob Marley, Marcus Garvey or Mahatma Gandhi\nAnd follow MLK steps back like scotty when we step towards greatness\nAnd I still haven\u2019t found my placement\nCuz hip hop hasn't made a leap of faith yet}\n\n{And today I got a feeling that I\u2019ve never felt\nAnd I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know what to say\nAnd today I got a feeling like not before\nAnd I guess I can\u2019t I guess I can\u2019t I guess I can\u2019t explain }"}]}
