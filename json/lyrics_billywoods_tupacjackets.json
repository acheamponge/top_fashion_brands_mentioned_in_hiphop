In the desert holes dug\nCosby sweater Pac leathers Suge gloves\nHold the pen like Sayyid Qutb No Love\nBlow me a dub looped up loose lips sink subs\nAmphibians swimmin' in primordial sludge\nBricks Ricky Rubio shoot spiteful\nPost-Quad Studios American Psycho\nSu-Su-Sussudio No Jacket Required\nAll your heroes wore wires\nQuilted liner made in china\nSlow night soft light\nGray\u2018s papaya Nighthawks Diner\nDon't let the sidewinders find ya\nMakaveli Pelle Pelle pepper sprayed R. Kelly\nHood Ebay be the Yemeni Deli\nCopped stadium coats pig in a poke\nIll repute and little note\nGloat in a cloud of wood smoke\nSlow roast the scapegoat\nStakes is low\n\n[Chorus: Elucid]\nI am but a mortal still the highest under\nI am but a mortal still the highest under\nFundamentally T.H.U.G\nCan't take it as it comes\nThey don't want me to feel\nThey don't want me to love\nI am but a mortal still the highest under\nI am but a mortal still the highest under\nFundamentally T.H.U.G\nCan't take it as it comes\nThey don't want me to feel\nThey don't want me to love\n\n[Verse 2: Billy Woods]\nFirst world problems got you shot in the noggin\nGrand opening grand closing grams is golden\nGeneral Mills deals inside Florida Avenue grill\nLanyard had his license to ill, expired but still\nShakur sport coat convinced your daughter to elope\nWoke to Greenpeace boarding the boat\nShellfish in barrels Shark Nigga Apparel tuna in brine\nJudge books by the spine\nSeems like I'm crashing on couches but this is interior design\nFour hundred of your Gregorian paradigm\nDamn right I'm on Colored People Time\nConsultancies on GP audible gasp at the consultancy fee\nAutograph the enhanced CD\nFuck can you really tell me\nFire sale on the Shelbyville Monorail\nSee you in hell before I see you in jail\nRead her areolae like braille\nThey explained the ship sailed\nChainmail 2Pacalypse later windbreaker\nWaiter said collards the new kale\n\n[Chorus: Elucid]\nI am but a mortal still the highest under\nI am but a mortal still the highest under\nFundamentally T.H.U.G\nCan't take it as it comes\nThey don't want me to feel\nThey don't want me to love\nI am but a mortal still the highest under\nI am but a mortal still the highest under\nFundamentally T.H.U.G\nCan't take it as it comes\nThey don't want me to feel\nThey don't want me to love"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
