Roll back the stones\nI\u2019m coming from space I told him he\u2019ll never repair again\nTake him through currents and RPMs take off his head then his limbs\nRip him apart then put him back together, Press start\nDestroy his ego with the torpedo sharks\nTook the Citrin from the planet Saturn\nPlaced it in the Garden of Eden for Eve and Adam\nIt\u2019s for liberation and Karma, check my armor in rapping\nI took Armageddon and placed it in my pages for ages\nAs disaster\n\n[Chorus]\nYo I got the Citrin, polish it with the friction\nWord of diction make you scared like superstition\nI got the Citrin, polish it with the friction\nWord of diction make you scared like superstition"}]}
