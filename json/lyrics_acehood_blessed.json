Lamar bumpin' in that bass\nBlessed up, toes to the chest up\nQueen, butt-naked, cookin' breakfast\nI just wanna' ride her like a Lexus\nDiamonds so retarded, rode the short bus (yes, lawd!)\nHad to tell the jeweler to anoint us (yes, lawd!)\nStay prayed up, that's a message\nJust to see tomorrow is a blessin'\nStay prayed up is the message\n\n[Chorus]\nEverything 'bout a nigga' blessed\nEverything 'bout a nigga' blessed\nEverything ain't about a K\nEverything ain't about a K\nKnow I got the squad on deck\nAnd we gon' make a movie on the set\nPull up like I own that shit, yo' baby-mama's on my dick\n(wait, wait, wait)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWake up in the morning to a new day (thank you Lord)\nGotta' thank the man up above me\nI might fuck around and drop a mix-tape\nI meditate and turn into a sensei\nPray everyday I get my life straight\nHeart turn cold like a ice tray\nSlidin' through the city like it's first base\nBlessings to my homies caught a cold case\nThis for nigga's gettin' it on the low-low\nHustlin' so their family is straight though\nI respect the game, nigga' bag up\nCovered in them crosses from the bad luck\nSmilin' for no reason, I got joy\nWay too much finessin', too much poise\nMiss my baby girl and my lil' boy\nEvery single time I hear their voice...
