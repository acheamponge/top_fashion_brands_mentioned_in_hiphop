Are you scared of me?\nAnd tell me, do you breathe at all? Is the air unclean?\nAnd I know I\u2019m walking slow, 'cuz I\u2019m bleeding in my sock\nAnd the cars that fill the road, are they ever gonna stop?\nAre they ever gonna stop? Are they ever gonna stop?\n\n[Chorus]\nWe\u2019ll pick up all the pieces\nAnd keep this all between me and you\nWe\u2019ll put back all the pieces\nAnd keep this all between me and you\nBetween me and you, between me and you\n\n[Verse 3]\nHidden planet, pretty hands, you take mine\nMelting me down\nWhisper sweet, you\u2019re wishing me a safe night\nAnd sending me out\n\n[Bridge]\nI don\u2019t wanna hear from anyone here so I didn\u2019t pack my phone\nNever really seen it rain before here, so I left my coat at home\nIf you wanna lead the way, you can take my hand and keep it\nI can keep a secret\nI don\u2019t wanna hear from anyone here so I didn\u2019t pack my phone\nNever really seen it rain before here, so I left my coat at home\nIf you wanna lead the way, you can take my hand and keep it\nI can keep a secret\n\n[Chorus]\nWe\u2019ll pick up all the pieces\nAnd keep this all between me and you\nWe\u2019ll pick up all the pieces\nAnd keep this all between me and you\nBetween me and you, between me and you\nBetween me and you, between me and you"}]}
