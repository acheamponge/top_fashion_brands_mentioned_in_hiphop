(I forget [Both] Ah fuck it, light the spliff)\nLive a legend, die a myth, this is where the lightnin' hits\nWhat they\u2019ll say\n(Fuck today, I be on my pirate ship\nI be on my viking shit, fighting and igniting shit\nAll I did is light her wrist, now Dionysus dyking it)\nYou know you\u2019re faded when you can\u2019t take the step, so\nSpace cadet, I might go Eraserhead, place your bets\n(Wasted vets, tasting sweat, OG Kush laced and wet\nOut here tryna make a rep, but really you won\u2019t make a speck)\nFace of death, day of dead, stumble toward a bayonet\nThey collect Elliott Smith with a plate again\n(Cage you in, major friends, murder\u2019s what they major in\nMajor sins, tattered limbs, strapped up in the abdomen)\n\n[Hook]", "album": "ULTRAVIOLET"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
