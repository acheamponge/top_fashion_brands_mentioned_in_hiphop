Kelly to your bitch, go and piss in her throat\nFrom pitching coke to sitting on boats\nMy life is eclectic, ice on the necklace\nSpend half my life ducking sheisty detectives\nCan't match the price, you ain't got no connections\nIt's hard being a dope boy in rap\nThese fucking nerd critics don't understand where I'm at\nYou went to a good school and had a lot of money\nI went to a hood school and had to dress bummy\nOnly time I had money was the Easter bunny\nI'm still mad so I don't like nobody speaking to me\nFuck the world with a dirty dick\nGive thirty-six ounces of yay and I'll murder it"}], "artist": "Termanology"}
