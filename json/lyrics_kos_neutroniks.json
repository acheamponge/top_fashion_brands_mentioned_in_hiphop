I know what you mean\nIt seems we're all trapped in the glitz and the gleam\nThe truth's just hidden for now, so don't sweat it\nSo here's a cassette\" and then I jetted!\n\n[Hook x4]\nAnd it don't stop, and it don't quit (come inside)\nIt's all fortified so jump on it (there's no use hiding)\nAnd to my people if you love your life, forget the strife (come inside)\nWe rock from night, until morning (the sun is high)\n\nAnd it don't stop, and it don't quit (come inside)\nIt's all fortified so jump on it (there's no use hiding)\nAnd to my people if you love your life, forget the strife (come inside)\nWe rock from night, until morning (the sun is high)\n\nAnd it don't stop, and it don't quit (come inside)\nIt's all fortified so jump on it (there's no use hiding)\nAnd to my people if you love your life, forget the strife (come inside)\nWe rock from night, until morning (the sun is high)\n\nAnd it don't stop, and it don't quit (come inside)\nIt's all fortified so jump on it (there's no use hiding)\nAnd to my people if you love your life, forget the strife (come inside)\nWe rock from night, until morning (the sun is high)\n\n\n[Interlude]\nGet your back up off the wall\nCan't afford to miss the boat when they call\n\nGet your back up off the wall\nCan't afford to miss the boat when they call\n\nGet your back up off the wall\nCan't afford to miss the boat when they call\n\nGet your back up off the wall\nCan't afford to miss the boat when they call\n\n[Background vocal]\nHigh, high, high, high, high, high, high, high\nHigh, high, high, high, high, high, high, high\n\n[K-Os]\nCome inside, there's no use hiding\nCome inside, the sun is high\nCome inside, there's no use hiding\nCome inside, the sun is high"}], "artist": "\u200bk-os"}
