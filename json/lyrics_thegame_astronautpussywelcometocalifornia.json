round\nRound and round, round and round\n\n[Verse 1: Game]\nBack to the Hooves\nRidin' down 74th and Hoover with my nigga ScHoolboy\nCadillac and a coupe\nSee them niggas hatin from afar, can\u2019t catch em now\nBut they getting smacked when we do\nRat-a-tat like we Snoop, Crown on the vic\nCrown on my wrist, crown on my bitch\nAnd a couple crowns on my crew\nCouple pounds of the blue\nIvy in it, tsunami in it when I be in it\nGot the lobby in it, Tommy in it\nThe trunk got a body in it\nNiggas be like, \"He bodying it\"\nZiplock full of J\u2019s, closet full of J\u2019s\nWorkin' on my Pippen, he\u2019s Scotty in it\nBath tub big enough to fit a Audi in it\n8 gold chains like a Saudi in it\nMurder with the ink, I\u2019m Gotti in it\nDon\u2019t get too popped, get your ass 2Pac'd\nCargos with the 12 gauge shotty in it\nPlus I still got a crib on Brazil\nI ain\u2019t never hardly there but I got a Maserati in it\nThat\u2019s my new addition, no Bobby in it\nChop shops in the hood, no karate in it\nSo much money, got a money tree\nWhoop so many niggas\u2019 ass, shit we money team\nSame fuck niggas with they hand out, same sad song\nBring the bands out, nigga should be workin on they money scheme\nBack to the convers', kill 'em with one verse\nConverse with the worst 'til one of our gun burst\nCall the mortuary, tell him niggas in one hearse\nCause Compton ain\u2019t like the city of Commerce\nNo back talk, back wall, end up in asphalt\nNiggas got them choppas like we flyin' the black hawk\nPut you with the roots, thinkin' a nigga was Black Thought\nNow hold that thought\nMotherfuckers wanna act loco\nHit 'em with numerous shots from the 4-4\nMotherfuckers wanna act loco\nHit 'em with numerous shots from the 4-4\n\n[Hook]\nToo high, can\u2019t come down\nLosing my head, spinning round and round\nToo high, can\u2019t come down\nLosing my head, spinning round and round\n\n[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]\nPray for me, I\u2019ll make 30\nDesert Eagle, my nails dirty\nEverything on life and I\u2019d die for it\nMade a mil', you ain\u2019t even know it\nTell Illuminati I\u2019m down for it\nCall Jigga, I'm next nigga\nSon niggas my new litter\nFuck the world on Earth Day\nHer booty clap on my birthday\nI would take the cake but I\u2019ve been paid\nI\u2019m a real nigga, you\u2019s arcade\nHad a switchblade in the 5th grade\nSmoked plenty weed on my mama\u2019s couch\nNow I\u2019m going big, I can buy the house\nYou sound water down, I sound off a ounce\nSee this for those who say \"Where you from?\"\nAnd for those hoes who go' make me cum\nBut them fuck niggas we don\u2019t fuck with them\nAnd fuck niggas gon' lose a lung\nKnock knock nigga, come feel the drum\nIf the bread low, I'ma stack the crumb\nHide the contraband in-between my gum\nBefore smoking dope, I was selling coke\nWell rocked up to a 8 year old\nWhen it popped up, call it pot luck\n500 G\u2019s, nigga pretty please\nCondos where it\u2019s sun and trees\n10 tees with my 80s\nHoover hats like the star of David\nPull on, shots a must, get me faded\nRan up on 'em, I ain't good with aimin'\nMove out the set but the set I\u2019m banging\n\n[Hook]\nToo high, can\u2019t come down\nLosing my head, spinning round and round\nToo high, can\u2019t come down\nLosing my head, spinning round and round\n\n[Verse 3: Skeme]\nLook, a young nigga really tryna stunt, fuck it\nWestside Ingles and I ain\u2019t, budging\nIndependent niggas with no, budget\nIf it ain\u2019t about a dollar gotta change, subjects\nRap ass niggas ain\u2019t sayin, nothing\nThis flow here, niggas can\u2019t, touch it\nMotherfuck friends, tinted windows on the Benz\nDoing doughnuts in the bitch got me trippin like a bucket\nSox gang off in the streets\n10 hut, bring the squadron with me\nSee niggas talk ballin like they been in the gym\nBut you lookin like a novice to me now quit talkin to me\nCan I vent?\nAll you niggas sound retarded to me\nKillin these niggas, I\u2019m a general nigga\nTurn yo head to a target for free\nNow I\u2019m on, look at me\nStarted, started with them pistols and palm trees\nNow when niggas come through the wood\nNiggas gotta know that that\u2019s all me\nSee the set catch rec\nWhen I slide through throwin up all bills\nAnd niggas wanna act like they thuggin like us\nWe said, \"Boy please\"\nThis S to the K to the E to the Mmm nigga\nNew Rolls go vroom nigga\n.4-5 cocked back like boom nigga\nGot enough loot to fill up a room nigga\nAnd I\u2019m rolling these blunts at 100 a go\nGave her that dick now she beggin' for more\nMade me a millie, yo bitch load is illie\nBut I ain\u2019t got, still got 100 to go\nAnd I do it, I does it, I spit it, you love it\nI just left from Newark, got bands in my luggage\nPlay with
