Deity or David Cage\nReality\u2019s a game we play, grab a seat and save the day\nI saw a snail crawling straight across a razor blade\nAnd it escaped unscathed, no sign of violence\nThere\u2019s no use, it\u2019s futile trying hiding\nI am Aiden\n\n[Hook]\nThe truth's twofold\nSeek what the truth holds\nPeek through the view to beyond\nTwo souls\nThe truth's twofold\nSeek what the truth holds\nPeek through the view to beyond\nTwo souls", "year": "2013-10-10"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
