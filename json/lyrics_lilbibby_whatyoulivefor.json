That'll get you flamed up\nRiding in the Benz, I've been in the zone\nCatch Bibby all alone, now I'm gripping on the chrome\nNiggas hit my phone, tryna cop a zone\nNigga must be working, man what type of shit he on?\nI can tell by how he talking, that nigga done lost it\nTryna put a case on me, you know that that's gon' cost him\n\n[Hook] x2\n\n[Verse 2]\nNigga what you live for?\nNiggas taking risks for the money, doing years for it\nGotta feed them kids boy\nGrinding so hard, I don't do it for myself\nLong as the fam straight, who gives a fuck about my health?\nLook, weighing up them grams, that's how I learned mathematics\nStunting for these hoes, these youngnins hustle ass backwards\nThem old heads didn't give them the game\nThese boys lost, man, that shit is a shame\nAnd when them boys rolled up, I seen niggas froze up\nThese the same niggas, they be acting like they so tough\nBoy, you need to stop it\nThat act, you need to drop it\nNiggas in the streets know I'm all about a profit, huh\n\n[Hook] x2\n\n[Bridge]\nCause I don't need nobody's help\nSaid I don't need nobody's\n\n[Hook] x2"}], "artist": "Lil Bibby"}
