Damn, who will be a friend of me?\nHip-Hop, Hip-Hop, help me kill the enemy!\nDJs, they never gave up, they kept faith\nEspecially Eclipse, he's got thousand of my soulmates\nAs far as I can see, I'ma never rest in piece\nThanks to modern pop stores, DJs in the streets, peace\n\nSir? We have another threat\nMP3s. And the internet", "album": "Sabacolypse: A Change Gon\u2019 Come"}], "artist": "Sabac"}
