(Hoist that bitch)\nMan, I'm 'bout to start ballin', for real\nMy vacation 'bout to start, I can't post none of this shit\nIt's too much ballin'\n\n[Verse 1]\nUh, pull the Lamborghini machines up on the double\nI'll make a youngin pull his jeans up\nTuck in his shirt and get 'em cleaned up (C'mere, c'mere)\nFold the crease in his chinos and have 'em steamed up\nI was solo then I teamed up (What up?)\nNow I'm pushin' buttons like Scotty when beamed up\nThe unidentified flyin' object defyin' logic\nI'll ride a pocket 'til my body rotten\nMore gone and forgotten, so many sons I put a couple up for adoption\n'Til then for me to stop is not an option\nSpillin' the clicker on the yacht while it was dockin'\nCaught me slippin' with no socks, in my moccasins\nI'm like your favorite fruit when it's in season, I been sneezin'\nRoll down the tint, I need my skin to the wind breezin'\nI need to feel the sun on my skin' beamin'\nDrownin' my thoughts, scratchin' the whiskers on my chin region\n\n[Interlude]\n\u2014gets mad or over-dramatic, it's shitty\nYou're drinking when you're writing?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI never said I came to re-invent the wheel\nBut I don't roll with the squares, it's blockin' out a nigga skill\nPosted in my pajamas in my Hugh Hef\nPavin' the way, see, I can show y'all a new step\nOr take it to the head like Russian Roulette and gamble thoughts\nThe cost crossed 'em off and thrown like a lacrosse toss\nShit, I'm slumped on the throne like a drunken boss\nSittin' on the wave still, supplier's an albatross\nI need space like astronauts\nAstronomically high, watchin' the stars crash a lot\nI'm a doctor, but I'm not Cliff Huxtable\nI got a sandwich and my feet up on the couch, I'm comfortable\nThere's no sacks in the hush, I get it plush\nCrush your luck, bag it up just to feel the rush\nNow that's a bad jewelry heist, the way I'm droppin' gems\nZeitgeist trim, precise, my advice is win (C'mon)\nI need to feel the light breeze from the slightest wind\nThe gang's 'bout to light 'em again (Go and let 'em in), yeah\nGo on, let 'em in\n\n[Interlude]\nWe know the air is unfit to breathe\nOur food is unfit to eat\nWe sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes\nAs if that's the way it's supposed to be\nWe know things are bad, worse than bad, they're crazy\nIt's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore\nWe sit in the house\nAnd slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller\nAnd all we say is\n\"Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms\nLet me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials\"\n\n[Outro]\nNo storm can last forever\nWhich is very unusual\nWhich is very unusual\nWhich is very unusual\nWhich is very unusual\nWhich is very unusual\nWhich is very unusual\nWhich is very unusual\nWhich is very unusual\nWhich is very unusual\nWhich is very unusual\nWhich is very unusual\nWhich is very unusual\nWhich is very unusual\nWhich is very unusual", "title": "Boat Shoes", "album": "Yacht Rock 2"}], "artist": "The Alchemist"}
