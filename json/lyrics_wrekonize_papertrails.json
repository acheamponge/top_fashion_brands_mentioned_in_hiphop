I'll settle for 20 friends or the below\nHow many of 'em are actually up for the roughest of roughest\nHe will never know\nThe circle of bodily changes, it's personal modification\nNo modesty and it's amazing, the hazing is strange and\nIt grows, in the city we know to be home\nI get so busy that as I get old, I feel the drone get above my zone\nIt's been a minute and this is a dividend of a significant trend it's ridiculous\nAnd I'm oblivious but I been lifting up on this curtain for so long\nWrong, this book of the faces strong\nSo shook and evasive, I'm getting the feeling we're never alone\nI'm walking around and stomping the ground\nThe Popular sounds a bottle of nouns\nYou talk up the town and your momma is proud\nCause \"Ooh, you got some followers now!\"\nWow, I lose friends like it's a sickness\nThey bend like it's for fitness, but Ben is never the witness\nGet this kiddie so dizzy he's ready to gimme\nHis every penny and beg for the ending\nAnd now for so long they been getting us on\nWith a method that they actually want us to call... friendly\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Wrekonize]\nCome one, come all\nCome down, log on\nCome one, come all\nCome one, come all\nCome down, log on\nCome one, come all\nCome down, log on\nLog on", "title": "Paper Trails", "year": "2013-06-25", "album": "The War Within", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e384fbb42e445fb209514af1582b2973.440x440x1.jpg"}]}
