I'm at a loss for words\nMy thought's reserved for an awesome verse\nIf I split several soliloquies with eloquence\nYou'll have to admit, I'm the rawest you heard\nCharming with words, even though I ain't heard alot\nI aim for the pant sagging youth, call me urban cops\nI mastered palavers cause cat's ain't on my caliber\nIf you plans involving catching up, I urge you to stop\nThat's off the top"}]}
