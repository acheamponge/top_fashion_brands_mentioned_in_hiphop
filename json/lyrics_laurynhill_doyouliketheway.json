Santana & CEE LO)\n\n[Lauryn's rap]\nWatch the master plan, the pastures span\nThrough the streets, move the sheep\nFlipped the beat, like the shepherd\nIt's a new day, my crew stay forever striving\nGive thanks cause we alive, and been through the gutter\nNow we see the horizon\nIt's clear to me now\nUsed to be confused, took a lot of years to see how\nNow, we moving planets\nTake the average mind and expand it\nYou take for granted like we're always gonna be disadvantaged\nBut soon come, it soon come, ya soon done\nYa start run, you stumble, we catch one\nIn the rhythm, Santana lick the guits with precision\nNot accidental, intentional conscious decision\nTo Zion, we're marching through with African Mayans\nConquering Babylon with the heart of a lion\nAnd the walls of Jericho come a-tumbling down\n\nTell me, how long has it been\nIs everything, everything alright my friend\n\nYou see, time is passing, people asking how come none of this ain't lasting\nMoney will make people deal like they don't even have to feel\nBut no, it ain't real, it ain't real\n\nOh, do you like the way that it's going down\nDo you like the way that it's going down\nOoh, do you like the way\n\nHow long, how long will we wait, to sit down and communicate\nSee, everything is relative, if you want to get then give\nCan't we all just build and live,can't we, can't we?\n\nDo you like the way that it's going down\nDo you like the way that it's going down\nDo you like the way that it's going down\nDo you like the way that it's going down"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
