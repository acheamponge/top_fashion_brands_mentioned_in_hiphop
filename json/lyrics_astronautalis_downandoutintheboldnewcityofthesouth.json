They're comin' here\nThey got the couch and he's got the chair\nI got the flower beds, some sweaty palms, a couple dumb ideas\nBrain, hearts and minds stuck in discovery fears\n\nI've been alive in little bursts\nIt's the little bits of life that hurt\nThe way to write's been across the dirt\nThe sunspots seen behind your work\nThe ball of kindness is shipping the bird\nToss in smiling, call him first\nIt covers up the best and hurts the worst\n\nThe little freckles the sun will painted across your shoulder blades\nThe biggest hit to come across the space\nThe calling and the fall of all who wait\nThe fingerprints and window glass\nThe funny women, superstitious, afraid of cats\nThe dumbest feeling, the embarrassment that puts us on our ass\n\nLooking back, then moving on\nThe stupid songs, the foolish ones\nThe wisest sighs, the brightest lies\nThe Broadway clip that turns the gate\nBroke hold but don't get close kids\nTurns out it's understood, it's time to miss\n\nI'm calling out to all the famous clowns and bums\nI'm sneakin' out, peakin' in your windows\nWatchin' you kiss the screen\nLovin' you, like I hope you love me\n\nI'm calling out to all the famous clowns and bums\nI'm sneakin' out, peakin' inside your homes\nWatchin' you, watch them split their seams\nLovin' them, like I hope they love me\n\nI'm calling out to all the famous clowns and bums\nI'm sneakin' out, peakin' in your windows\nI'm calling out to all the famous clowns and bums\nI'm sneakin' out, peakin' in your windows\n\nI'm calling out to all the famous clowns and bums\nI'm sneakin' out, peakin' in your windows\nWatchin' you, watch them split their seams\nLovin' them, like I hope they love me\n\nThe sun came in over on the building ridge\nAnd 56 feet below, a Domincan jogs his path to death 'round paint stained block\nWhile the chief turns on his radio and cracks his Steel Reserve\nI wonder how many of last night's lovers double parked\n\nThis city swallows men\nHe tells me tales of places that he ran, eventually ran from\nNever to return again\nIt's funny in luck and love\nYou can never remember the moment that you fell in\nOr recall when you fell out of touch\n\nThe city's hushed, keepin' it's secrets\nThe sunshine is blinding, riding, hiding wrinkles and creases\nBeautiful features chipped, cracked, crippled and weakened\nTragic pageant queen bleeds; soft focus keepin' her even\n\nThe city's breathing, feel it coming awake\nEvery exhalation creates a gray across the skyscape\nLike the sky's a looking glass and in the fog, the dirty breath left\nWe can etch our dreams and wipe it clean before they see\n\nIt's city's rushing, picking up a bitter steam a bit\nThe Chief's beat his shift till first sip\nA malt liquor will bleed through lips\nHe flips a small piece of shit\nDriver's license for money clip\nAnd showing off everything equipped\nWith a face like, \"Look what I did...\"\n\nCity's up in arms, the Chief is ravin'\nSick of taxes, sick of working\nSick of waitin', sick and tired of what the city's faced\nEnlisting ladies chased from the bottom of his history's basement\nA tomb of her own, a room caked in cobwebs, odd and ends and vases\n\nThis city's built a head of steam, the river shivers steadily\nThe poison boilin' up from beneath the lies and memories\nI spent the last three months in shambles\nDrunk on clouds and syphoned stars\nI shook every palm left-handed\nDozing off inside the back of a bar\n\nWoke in a party with streamers tossed inside my hair\nMy head's been ringin' loud\nA cigarette burns out inside my left hand\nAnd dust the cane and bottled cacophony off of me, standing\nAnd blow a kiss to my chair\n\nUnlock the deadbolt baby, I'm comin' home\nYou'll never see my face around here\nYou'll never see my face around here\nYou'll never see my face again\n\nThe patron saint will take his place singing me to sleep\nNow I need strength now that all my rowdy friends have settled down\nFingertips and sandy pockets full of stolen beer\nAnd all I can come up with the same news is bad news from this old town\n\nIt's all I have, what a beautiful piece of rotten luck\nYou don't have the right to pay for my kisses and backwater dreams\nI'm sneakin' my hands across your shoulder blades\nIn hopes you fall into my arms and fall into the leaves then fall asleep\n\nAnd while the city grinds its teeth\nWe're dreaming while we race, hold me fast, to boot straps\nThe leaves are holding us to the earth\nWith your eyes shut tight, anyone can be king\nWe're in projectors, steal concesssions, like the picture was blurred\n\nWe face the days that we can't see, we run and we fall\nWe hate this place, but we can't leave, so what do we call it?\nNow it's cornered by the cat's calls that's chewed through the walls\nHave you ever met such a son of a bitch you hated to love?\n\nFacing the sun centers away from a soft shoe, dreams of tap dance\nHangover a headache aversion to civility, turning to beach\nArm in arm over an old flame\nBefore the kids, the cats, the catch-22s and the cocaine\n\nI know it's slow, James, the strips malls are the same\nWith a fresh coat of paint and more fucking fast food chains\nBut it's okay, my feet are still fine\nThe sun's still burning, blurring lines between the sea and the sky\n\nLeaving me blind to stagger from the scene to the street\nThe street to the streams that bleed to the east to feed the machine and leave us in peace\nSoon as they receive their load and sing a song of St. John's\nAnd sail alone around the rest of the globe\n\nWe sail alone through the night past your house\nStealing signs, laughing loud, driving dragons, passing out\nPrivate pageants, collapsing clouds, it's our version of laughing out\nWe're down and out in the bold new city of the south\n\nCalling out...", "year": "2006-05-23"}]}
