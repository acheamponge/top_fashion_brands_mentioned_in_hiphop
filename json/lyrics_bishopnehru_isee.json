AIGH!\"\nPapi Chulito, make it look easy like free throws\nThey see sequels, I see C Notes\n\n[Hook]\nI see that they trynna test me\nI see clowns they trynna stress me\nI see biddies trynna sex me\nI see why I'm kinda sexy\nI see fakes squeal once they envy\nI see snakes in see them simply\nI see why some act so empty\nI see I can't leave no entries"}], "artist": "Bishop Nehru"}
