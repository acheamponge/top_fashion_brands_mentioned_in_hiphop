Empty out your throat on me\nIt just looks like you're lip synching Obla Di\nObla da, every time you go, \"blah blah Blah\"\nI'm hearing \"life goes on\" like it's your mantra\nSo talk shit, but when it's prone to go down\nYou're afraid of your own bull like rodeo clowns\nI stay low to the ground, I stay plugged in\nAnd when my dome needs love, phones hug my skin\nBut Earbuds don't count, they're headphone loopholes\nI want 'em bigger than a couple sideways soup bowls\nAnd if you're saying next to nothing\nMake like my playlist and get to shufflin'\n\n[Chorus]\nI Can't hear you (I got my headphones on)\nI Can't hear you (I got my headphones on)\nI Can't hear you (I got my headphones on)\nI got headphones on (I got my headphones on)\nWhen I look at who's around\nAnd it feels like two's a crowd\nI don't run and hide\nI just smile real wide\nAnd I turn my music loud\n\n(WATSKY!)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/15e329cac8808712e9bcdedd4c1b05fd.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Guilty Pleasures", "title": "Headphones Remix"}]}
