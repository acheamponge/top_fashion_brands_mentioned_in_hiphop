"You know, you know listen to me\nMama help, I fell in love with a young girl\nThat's true, so true, you're the only girl I love to\nBut my heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world\nSo true, so true, listen\nI wasn't tryin to lead her on\nSee I didn't want to be alone\nBut when she smiles she brought me home\nSo I brought her home\nIt's not that the feelin' of love is gone\nCan't expect a college girl to be grown\nI can't give a fuck what so and so says\nCrushes hurt both ways\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nSomebody tell me what I'm suppose to do\nMama help, I fell in love with a young girl\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nYoung girl, so in love with you\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nSomebody tell me what I'm suppose to do\nMy heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nYoung girl, so in love with you\nThe single girls are out tonight\nBut you have one word, my heart, one life\nAnd I'm not lookin' 'round\nSo why you lookin' down\nWhat you lookin' down for?\nI fucked up a long time ago\nSee I should have never let you know\nSee I couldn't give a fuck what tabloids say\nAs the People Magazine and crushes hurt both ways\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nSomebody tell me what I'm suppose to do\nMama help, I fell in love with a young girl\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nYoung girl, so in love with you\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nSomebody tell me what I'm suppose to do\nMy heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nYoung girl, so in love with you\nHove got a young girl\nHove got a young girl, still not quite 21\nSo high strung, such a vibrant thing\nI introduce myself, \"Hi miss thing\"\nYou're 19?\nNo, you're lighting in a bottle I give you a ring tomorrow\nThe scene that follows, screams of horror\nClassic Steven King novel\nMama don't think you should take someone\nSo advanced in romance, you should just wait\nPapa don't preach, hove don't fight\nHopin' threw it I might mo your life\n'Cause I'ma show you right\nProper etiquette and how to hold your knife\nKeep it competitive with Opras ice\nBe like Janet, take control of your life\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\n(Young girl)\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\n(Young girl)\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\n(Young girl)\nSomebody tell me what I'm suppose to do\n(Young girl)\nMama help, I fell in love with a young girl\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\n(Too young, I'm never to young)\nYoung girl, so in love with you\n('Cause I'm never too young)\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\n(Too young, I'm never to young)\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\n('Cause I'm never too young)\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\n(Too young, I'm never to young)\nSomebody tell me what I'm suppose to do\n('Cause I'm never too young)\nMy heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world\nWhat on earth, what I'm suppose to do\nYoung girl, so in love with you\nThis is where the story begins baby\nThere were flashing lights when we met\nNot the typical place you would be\nIn a flash of time my mind was set\nI knew you were the girl there for me\nAnd though you just wanted to leave\nImagine how great it could be\nThe F U T U R E, spells the future girl\nSit down hold your horses don't leave, where you going girl?\nCome and sit with me, don't be so quick to leave\nI really like you girl\nLet's trade thoughts and words, explore the universe\nBut just don't leave me girl\nI really like you girl, girl\nFrom the moment that we met\nI really like you girl, oh, girl\nI know it Susan\nAgainst the wall is where you lean\nThe most beautiful girl that I've seen\nOut of this world, my God, you bling\nI'm surprised that you are a human being\nAnd though you just wanted to leave\nImagine how great it could be\nThe F U T U R E, spells the future girl\nSit down hold your horses don't leave, where you going girl?\nCome and sit with me, don't be so quick to leave\nI really like you girl\nLet's trade thoughts and words, explore the universe\nBut just don't leave me girl\nI really like you girl, girl\nFrom the moment that we met\nI really like you girl, oh, girl\nI know it Susan\nCome and sit with me, don't be so quick to leave\nI really like you girl\nLet's trade thoughts and words, explore the universe\nBut just don't leave me girl\nI really like you girl, girl\nFrom the moment that we met\nI really like you girl, oh, girl\nI know it Susan\nYo, I think I got the one now\nNever me man, never me, never in a million years\nBut I do", "year": null}]}
