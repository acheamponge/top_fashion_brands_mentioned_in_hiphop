We\u2019ll be super old\nMany winners will lose, many heroes will fall\nAnd if that\u2019s me I\u2019m still (free from it all)\n\n[Hook Mathai]\nCameras flash, the curtains call, the credits roll down the screen\nCritics laugh, they hate us all as they applaud\nBut should I fall\nI\u2019m still free from it all\nIt all it all it all\nIt all it all it all"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
