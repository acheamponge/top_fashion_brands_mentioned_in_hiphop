You know that that's standard\nYou see the ground, but it's bound to be a crash landing\nYou need to be here now, you always go within\nYou want to touch down, it's hard to do with broken wings\nIt's like your hearts pain is everything you can't take\nForget about your past days, remember that our scars fade\nI know how you feel, talking 'bout it won't do\nBut you'll be fine that's exactly what I'm going through\n\n[Hook:]\nMy wings are broken\nMy wings are broken"}]}
