I'm unsure, but so sin surr\nGet your hurr did, that ain't a perm, yo, that's a temporary\nThat ain't a wormhole, that's a cemetary where they bury the lies\n\nI'm lampin', I'm cold, cold lampin' out in the snow, campin'\nCuttin' wires so your phone can't ring\nYou don't know a damn thing after your city gets undertaken\nPass me a sissy so sucka I'll slay him\n\nDamage, uh, damage, uh\nDances, famine\nDamper, dancer, Francis\nHah, MF Doom on the beat\n\nNon Prophets, Slug and Ali\nTogether at last, like cocks and cunts\nYeah, let's fuck it up, clip that beat\n\nYou know, we're pretty much humanous\nAnd that's where we'd like to work from\nFrom that vantage point\n\nExactly and you know Non Prophets is spelled\nLike you know, like P O R P H E T like meaning\nLike Non Prophets, almost like a pun in the word", "album": "Sickly Business"}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
