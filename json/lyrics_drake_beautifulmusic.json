I got few days left\nAnd I'm a make use of every single one\nUntill every singles done and till every record is sold\nAnd till every string is strung\nThey tell me to take a breather and Drake everything will come\nDog... it's always been the same\nIt's all love\nLike no score in a tennis game\nFor the son of Dennis James\nOwner of the city downtown on a Friday\nStreets behind me like I took a picture in a driveway\nI roll down strips and hosed down whips that when turtles wax up\nThey will close down richmond\nWith no down shiftin'\nHaters will say I'm adequate\nI think I got the type of flow to make a addict quit\n19 years I been pimpin' since then repurchased Trap Muzik 4 time since then\nSeamless transition I'm the new fresh prince gettin' pennies for my thoughts\nSo I put my 2 cents in\nTop of the mornin' I am dropin' a coin in plus\nI'm changin' the game you see me swapin' a joint in\nThey put fire out bring the buyers out and try to box us all together\nFor they buy us out\nThey profit from the event\nWe handin' fliers out\nWe profit from the attempt to hand desires out\nBut rich is how we're all endin' up\nSo if you selling charter Jetts call Brenden up\nHolla!"}]}
