Me? No so please don't dig\nMe don't give no two freeload chicks\nOkay, one freeload but see that's it\nBetter leave to the streets won't be no tip\nNo whip no week Mexico trip\nNo please don't speak don't need no lip\nZip it, Jimmeny Crick, Lickety Split\nSnip snip snippin' a tip, quicker than quick\nFlip shit, rippin' a hip, sicker than pick\nMr. Mix with some liquor like a rip of romance\nYeah, you love it when I'm rumpin' just don't bump on my shit", "year": null}]}
