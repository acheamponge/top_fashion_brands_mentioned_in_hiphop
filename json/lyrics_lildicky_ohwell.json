You know Rae Sremm?\nI like 'No Type,' but I really hate them\"\nLike I asked for your opinion when I barely even know what day it is\nI'm past due on student loans and my rent\nBut I just bought new J's and shit\nGoing way fast on a one way road with the window down tryna wave at them\nMy mom says I should go back to classes\nBut I'm in the strip club and I'm tapping asses\nAnd bitch look like Jacqueline Onassis\nBut she lies a lot and can't kick the habit\nI've tried to stop giving passes to those who front it cause that's living backwards\nAnd they give two cents when I ain't even ask them\nTreat them like exams and I need to pass them\nI twisting dutches, I don't do the Backwoods\nBut this gas station don't carry those\nAnd I'm tryna smoke, man, how tragic\nHere's a 20 and some change, man, you can have it like\nNo\n\n[Hook 3: Lil Dicky]\nOh well\nOh well\nOh well"}], "artist": "Lil Dicky"}
