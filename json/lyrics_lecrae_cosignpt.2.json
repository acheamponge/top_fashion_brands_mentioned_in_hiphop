Y'all OD, follow me\nWanna reign, follow me\nKing, ya'll know the King\nMartin Luther King\nYou ain't really on a throne, boy you in a dream\nWake up, wake up, y'all don't want it\nDown to The Wire, better put Marlo on it\nAnd el es un chico malo, homie\nAnd if I'm scared, I guess I don't know it\nCause I'm still going\nStill right where the heat at\nAnd where I ain't supposed to be\nThat's where I be at\nAnd I spit that, sit back\nListen to the truth\n'Fore the sky crack and the Lord gets back\nOr somebody want some hit back\nAnd they click-clack, they be bent back\nLeaking out that syntax\nNever left but I been back\nCross on my big-knack\nAnd I don't rap Gospel, I live that\nBut I'm nothin' but a gimmick?\nSee me in a club\nFunny, you was in it?\nSkip a co-sign shout out to the homie Kendrick\nAnd all I hear is crickets\nWhen I run into the critics\nOh well, it sure tells me a lot\nWhen they tell me to rock\nKeep my eyebrows raised smell what I'm cookin'?\nAnd the sales may drop\nYeah, the mail may stop\nBut they ask for the truth\n(Yeah then I'mma do it)\nThey like \"how you do dat dair?\"\nSounds kinda nice, boy \"who dat dair?\"\nIs everything real, good, true and fair?\nBut you prob'ly wouldn't listen\nIf you knew \"dat dair\"\n\n[Outro: Don Cannon]\nThere's nothing you could do or say to me\nTo knock me off my square\nThe Reach Records empire\nThe number one co-signer Don Cannon\n(The Cannon, the Cannon)\nCreepin' out the lions' den\nSo really all it takes\nIs a little training camp\nAnd the attributes go right back up\nLeft hook, check\nRight hook, check\nUppercut is a check\nRight, left, right, jab is a check\nA hundred wins, no losses\nI think that sound about right\nLecrae\nChurch Clothes 2\nThe wait is finally over"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
