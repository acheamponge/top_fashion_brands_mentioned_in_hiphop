Baby you should thank me\nWhat, I said what, is the matter? Baby I'm a bachelor\nI, I said I, I want to get to know you.. So baby come closer\n\n[Hook]\nWhy the hell you gotta be so cold?\nWhy the hell is you so angry, baby? (Cold!)\nI ain't causing you no danger, baby (Cold!)\nYou just kinda mad now ain't you, baby?\nWhy the hell you gotta be so cold?\nWhy the hell is you so evil, girl? (Cold!)\nI just thought that maybe I'd meet you, girl (Cold!)\nThis niggas just trying to greet you, girl\n\n[Bridge 2]\nBye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou, I said you, need to cool it.. You're looking foolish\nWhen, baby, when, is your period finished? Ha! Women..\nNow please, I said please, you need to leave.. 'Cause you're a beast\nNow here, here, is my number.. Call me next summer, when you're warmer\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Cold", "album": "Hi!
