to over here (still smokin')\nAnd its nuthin'..\n\n[Verse 1]\nI went from selling dope to selling weed and CD's\nAnd doing little dirt for my BG's for green leaves\nI went from knee-deep, from stateline to stateline\nI had to make mine so I wouldn't have to take mine\nI went from playtime to robbin in the nighttime\nI went from daytime to mobbin on the bayline\nTo Alcatraz it was taking chunks outta my ass still I\nI went from empty to a full tank of gass\nI went from filty to clean when my momma passed\nI changed and went from doing good things to drama fast it's strange\nI went from pain to gain I went from game to game\nI went from grain to grain, and went from the past\nTo the present I went from artist to the president\nCEO Siccmade musicc is my residence\nI went from broke to fiendin' for dead presidents\nI went from no hope to king its all evident\n\nSo everybody rise with me\nRealise with me\nYou don't know whats on my mind\nShots out to Sicx when I spit this rhyme\nSloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme\nI'm all up in the cut when I hit this dime\nTomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time\n(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI went from hospitals to funerals to graveyards\nFrom Hell's Kitchen like Mel Gibson in Braveheart\nI went from they yard to my yard\nI went from having light scars to bulletwounds tight cars and silverspoons\nI went from the southside to the north to the eastside\nI let the meat fry, stress from eating pork\nI went from me ride to I ride\nI went from livin it up to writing notes that talk suicide do or die\nIt's been a hard road I went from slamming cardoors to 6-4's to 2004's\nI went from blued out in clothes to never booed out at shows\nWho doubt the foe led toast\nI went from homies to enemies I went from gold weed to indonese\nI couldn't stop needing\nI went through every season I went through to every reason for nothing\nPlenty reasons to be touching the remedies\n\nSo everybody rise with me\nRealise with me\nYou don't know whats on my mind\nShots out to Q-ball when I spit this rhyme\nSloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme\nI'm all up in the cut when I hit this dime\nTomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time\n(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)\n\nI went from next to nothing to pressing button and black keys\nFrom 15 to 23 walking the streets\nFrom OE to no weed I'm paranoid\nThey all tell me they love me, it's all null and void\nI play with toys, you know, shots to big Zo\nI went from 40 to 0 just to get hydro\nI went from him to him thats how the story goes\nTearing from limb to limb touching the 44's\nI went from Sac to Chicago just to promote\n200 dollars in my pocket looking hella broke\nDid the show and made 15 g's\nAnd don't you know I smoked 15 bleezies\nI went from I don't got enough its nuthin\nI went to damn I got it rough, where's the luck at?\nI went from hell and back I went from ballin in black to smelling up the\nBack alleys with Maui Wowee, I been telling you that\n\nEverybody rise with me\nAnd realise with me\nThat you don't know whats on my mind\nShots out to Big Dan when I spit this rhyme\nSloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme\nAnd I'm all up in the cut when I hit this dime\nTomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time (you know it)\n(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)\n\nSo everybody rise with me\nAnd realise with me\nYou don't know whats on my mind\nShots out to E-Mill when I spit this rhyme\nSloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme\nAnd I'm all up in the cut when I hit this dime\nTomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time\n(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)\n\nSo everybody rise with me\nAnd realise with me\nThat you don't know whats on my mind\nShots out to X-Raided when I spit this rhyme\nI'm sloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme\nAnd I'm all up in the cut when I hit this dime\nTomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time\n(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)\n\nSo everybody rise with me\nAnd realise with me\nThat you don't know whats on my mind\nShots out to Jam Master Jay when I spit this rhyme\nI'm sloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme\nAnd I'm all upon the cut when I hit this dime\nTomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time\n(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)\n\nSo everybody rise with me\nRealise with me\nThat you don't know whats on my mind\nShots out to Royal D when I spit this rhyme\nAnd I'm sloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme\nAll up in the cut when I hit this dime\nTomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time\n(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)\n\nOne mo' time everybody\n\nRise with me\nRealise with me\nYou don't know whats on my mind\nShots out to No Love when I spit this rhyme\nI'm sloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme\nAnd I'm all upon the cut when I hit this dime\nTomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time\n(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)\n\nWatch out\n(Hey you got the cigarette? - Thanks homie)\n(Shots out to the homie A-Jay who's been down the whole album)\n(Hey lets continue
