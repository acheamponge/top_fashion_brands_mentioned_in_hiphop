Then the less you do, the better\nCause women equate dance with sex\nThey gon' see you, and be like - next\nBut you gon' be like, hold up ma! - next\nBut she gon' be like, uh-uh pah! - next\nNow looka here, rule number one, know your name\nIt ain't Usher, Justin, Hammer? Then we can touch ya\nRule number two, never do a dance you can't do\nWhy stupid? You can't do it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Will Smith]\nSo I'm up in my spot in Miami the other night right\nAnd this dude out on the floor OD'n, just way overdancin\nYou know so his mami wanna holla at me\n\n[Verse Two: Will Smith]\nShe thought my name was Billy, I told her it was Willie\nShe said she watched my TV show and I was very silly\nTold her I was from Philly, she looked at me said really?\nAnd judgin from her t-shirt I could tell that she was chilly\nSo I gave her my sweater, she said her name was Etta\nShe said she come from Cuba and she just had bought a Jetta\nShe said she glad I met her, let's go somewhere together\nShe said she'd ride in my car, cause she knew my car was better\nThe conversation cookin, attention gettin tooken\nMy Spidey Sense is tinglin, I felt somebody lookin\nNow who this brother lookin, and now he runnin bookin\nI'm mad I'm like the fisherman I almost had my hook in\nI figured I should get up, and quickly clear my head up\nRosetta got a man, got me feelin kinda set up\nNow dude was really fed up, and yo he wouldn't let up\nHomey if I hit you you might never ever get up\nNow he was not a dancer, plus he wasn't handsome\nComin like Mel Gibson like I had his girl from ransom\nPedro wanna go outside\nYo amigo, tranquilo, slide\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three: Will Smith]\nNow rule number three is easy\nPlease re-member that you ain't on Beach Street\nThe sweet beat you ain't tryin to win no TV\nAnother dude get a move no need to outdo it\nRule number four, out on the floor\nDon't be doin moves that don't nobody do no more\nDraw too much attention it be adventureous on the floor\nThere's a reason that don't nobody do 'em no more, you feel me?\nThis may be hilarious\nBut rule number five is SERIOUS, uh\nIt's a shame to even have to discuss\nBut it's no lip bitin or pelvic thrusts, I mean\nYou think that move'll put the sting on her?\nYou too close, tryin to put a ring on her?\nYou don't know that girl, don't cling on her\nAnd don't put your thing on her, cool?\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b6862accc0e70d12f7d4a50c2aee85da.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Lost and Found", "title": "If U Can\u2019t Dance (Slide)"}]}
