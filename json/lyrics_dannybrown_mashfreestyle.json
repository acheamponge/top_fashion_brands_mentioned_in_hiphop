Dilla\n\n[Verse 1]\n2 AM in the city of the motor\nBlowing on some purple I copped form Saratoga\nBlock hot spot field like Minnesota\nSpace heater on, ain't getting no warmer\nCrack head Yolanda\nKnocking at the door\nWanna cop a nick but she only got four\nGave it back to her, said go to the store\nGrab me some loosies, red Faygo\nTwenty six grams on the broke piece of mirror\nWhat I do with it? Attract the gold diggers\nGot me the Cutty with the European clip\nSueded inside the color of cheese grits\n26 inches make the hook get nervous\nBrown so fly my phone ain't got service\nAnd y'all niggas lame\nI'm stunting, more white than X-Games\nMore green than Celtic games\nAnd I fly the purple in like soul plane\nGot the old school in my baby mama name\nOff temporary service\nBoost mobile chirp but it's never in service\nMotherfucker [?]\nWork coming back in the glass pot, Pyrex\nBreak a thing down one safety pin\nFresh out the county, I ain't ever seen a pit\nLocked up in bull pens, I'm a stay eating\nCommissary look like I went trick-or-treating", "year": null}], "artist": "Danny Brown"}
