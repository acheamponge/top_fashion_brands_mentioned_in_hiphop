I pulled out my dick in group therapy\nDust the gorilla till they passed the Glock to Kong\nAnd smacked around the ward and poured him a straight by Dr. Strong\nManic, depressed slashed chest keep a eye full\nSorry, we found Prozac makes my bipolars suicidal\nNo family visits add fuel\nTo the engine descending my fist on my stepdad's faggot face for attention\nAnd when a tear comes in the room like, what's the matter?\nI'm eating the brownies mom made then smacking her with the platter\n\n[Chorus]\nSample:\n*I wanna roll with the devil*\n\nCage talking in backround:\nNothing works here\nI've been here for seven years\nThe medication don't work\nNothing works here\nI've been here for seven years\nI hate this place\n\nI'm starting to adjust\nHolding my dick to escape the lust\nTill these girls in group, explain their rapes and bust\nSwitched to jeans\nConformness with a different theme\nMy performance to my parents deserves a zipper meet\nAnd after a year when they ask me why I'm still here\nI'm like, this shit is college for my fuckin' rap career\nNew bitch on the unit!\nFine, fuckin' her first\nPut on suicide watch and jerk in front of the nurse\nMolested bitch with tits that loves beatings\nDoing ant hills of dope thinking it's coke at drug meetings\nAnd when she starts to fucking seizure I'ma leave her\nBy the freezer while I'm taking breathers of ether with a fever\nJack the phone calling my friends fake faggots\nKicking the nurse in her tits when they throw me a straight jackets\nThat's what you get, dumb bitch, now you're crying pet\nWhile I'm waiting for the drugs to kick in like a dying vet\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm getting desperate\nI'm thinking my only exit\nWas jerking off in medicine cups to get this bitch pregnant\nI'm trying to make it through group with no jokes of shitting permitted\nTry signing yourself out and not getting committed\nMy family sessions go great, with a slap to the mouth\nAnd my stepdad's like, \"You ain't coming back to the house!\"\nLook who's the better patient\nI went to rape the nurse in the nurse's station\nBroke in and took some medication\nOn Thanksgiving I stuck my dick in the turkey\nAnd had the doctor on call play with my dick checking for herpes\nDoctor is strange, swinging the open locks\nUnder a blanket while the whole unit tear me with soap and socks\nA silent child, plotting the violent style\nTalking to a rifle out loud like Private Pyle\nTeen geek with a girl, looking to fuck but struck out\nHolding my doctor hostage cause I can't get the fuck out\n\nMan 1 talking:\nIt's horrible!\nHe's loosing his mind\nThat's the only explanation\n\nMan 2:\nHe's gone berserk\nThe man is obviously a lunatic\n\nMan 1:\nDeprived that his actions can only be described as the ravings of a mad man\n\nWoman X3:\nThe patient has shown no progress\nThe medication is not working\n\nMan 2:\nHe's gone berserk\nThe man is obviously a lunatic\n\nWoman:\nThe patient has shown no progress"}]}
