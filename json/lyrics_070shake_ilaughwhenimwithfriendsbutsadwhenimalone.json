And God forgive me if I cry\nThen I'll become an attention seeker and not a leader\nSee people will only really understand you when they need you\nI guess I'm better off all alone in a two-seater\nPeople tellin' me to stop, don't be a weak human being\nWhile the voice inside my head keeps tellin' me that I need it\nI now ask you, please stop judgin' me\nI got myself out this single handedly\nAnd we do what we do 'cause we don't understand the consequence\nOf every step we take is wrong, how could we ever see the mess?\n(uhh)\nAnd it's not just you and me, the whole youth is depressed\nLiving with the devil, constant battle every day\nWake up, gotta talk to people but I don't know what to say\nAnd they tellin' me get off my ass, I was born on the wrong path\n(yeah, mmm)\nAnd I'm tryna solve these problems, but I was always bad at math\n(mmm, yeah)\nAnd your voice has made it harder, and that's just honestly\nI had to shoot up to my brain to become the person that I wanna be\n(Yeah, oh)\nGrowin' up tryin' to figure out who you are\nSniffin' shit at 14, it becomes a little hard\nWhen you're livin' in a scene where the healthy shit is far\nBut the drugs are no further than your room or your car\nDon't be alarmed, it'll get brighter, it'll get better\nIt's 'cause we are fighters and tougher than leather\nThe strong you is inside, but you just haven't met her\nOnly we control our storm because we are the weather\nDon't get how I could love the things that really torn me\nRemember tellin' myself that I was quittin' in the mornin'\nAnd was you really tryna help or was you tryna tell a story?\nIt's okay 'cause I got me and I don't need you to feel sorry\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe future's bright, let's make it plural\nWe got us, we are the light\nWe are the world, we are love\nWe gotta fight for ourselves 'cause no one's gonna\nNo one's gonna\n(Yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\nI laugh when I'm with friends, but I'm sad when I'm alone\nAnd I be alone and I be alone and I be alone\nAnd I be alone\nAnd I be alone\nAnd I be alone\n(Yeah Uh)\nI laugh when I'm with friends but I'm sad when I'm alone\nAnd I be alone, I be alone (Yeah, ohhh)\nI laugh when I'm with friends but I'm sad when I'm alone\nAnd I be alone", "title": "I Laugh When I\u2019m With Friends But Sad When I\u2019m Alone"}], "artist": "070 Shake"}
