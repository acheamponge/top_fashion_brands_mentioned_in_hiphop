"[Intro by Necro]\n\nThis is a Captain Carnage\nAnd Necrophiliac duet of death\n\n[Captain Carnage Verse 1]\n\nIt's the witchcraft killer\nFillin' my fuckin' bag with skulls\nCuttin up bodies until my blade dulls\nI don't give a fuck about the people dying\nTry to take mines\nAnd on your fuckin' back you'll be lying\nDead\nLike a corpse in a ditch, or\nThey'll find your fuckin' body in Prospect Park, bitch\nI'll have you fuckin' hangin' like a slaughtered cattle on a meat hook\nThen your fuckin' flesh is getting cooked\nRoasted, until the fuckin' point that it's toasted\nI suggest that you don't fuckin' piss me off\nBecause my fuckin' hollow tips ain't soft\n\nI'll rip out your rectum, blow out your back\nWhen I'm on the attack\nI'm a fuckin' maniac\nI don't know who the fuck I am\nOr what the fuck I'm doin'\n'cause another dead body is what I'm pursuin'\n\nSo I continue to laugh\nKnowin'  any given moment I could cause a blood bath\n\n[Chorus, Necro and Captain Carnage]\nDestined to die kid\nDestined to die\nMotherfuckers are just destined to die\nDestined to die kid\nDestined to die\nMotherfuckers are just destined to die\n\n[Captain Carnage Verse 2]\n\nAgain I bloody your squash\nWhen I flush human mush down the toilet\nI want my fuckin' green soylent\nDonate an organ and I'll make sure you die\nThere's no escaping New York\nEven if you fuckin' try\n\nI stick my fuckin' pick, machete blade always slices\nGet too close, and I'll kill you with my fuckin' knife kid\nI chop a booker in the heart, then I poach her\nWhen I reupholster, they fuckin' won't know ya\n\nA leg here, an organ over there\nYour fuckin' body parts scattered every-fuckin'-where, I'm\nFully demented, I convict them consequently\nI can't be prevented from the bitches that I tormented\n\nIn my dungeon, I'll be fuckin' plungin'\nAll types of cunts, are disposed of ya life functions\nAct hard and you'll wind up in my back yard\nAsk God why he pulled your fuckin' last card\n\nViolators get smeared with tar and feathers\nBitches get strapped up in different kinds of leathers\nI'm fuckin' stingy\nI'll be quick to grab the last piece of flesh\nI'm looking forward to see your death\n\n[Chorus, Necro and Captain Carnage]\nDestined to die kid\nDestined to die\nMotherfuckers are just destined to die\nDestined to die kid\nDestined to die\nMotherfuckers are just destined to die\n\n[Captain Carnage Verse 3]\n\nWhat the fuck you looking at you stupid ugly motherfucker\nI'll shoot you like a dog in a heartbeat\nAnd when I fuckin' eat your brain for lunch\nYour bones go crunch\nAs I fuckin' munch your corpse\n\n'cause you ain't shit, but salt and pepper to this New York stepper\nKid you'll get swept up, like a dollar\nIf you fuckin' try to holler\nI'll be leaving you in a bloody fuckin' color\nMother fucker\nI'll never swallow my pride\nI'd rather see you die than let a motherfucker slide\n\nNervous fucks get piped and plowed\nTry to get loud, I'll leave you dead with a fuckin' cloud\nI take no bullshit\nI got a fuckin' full clip\nAnd my silencer makes me more violenter\n\nSo motherfucker step and tempt me\n'cause I'll be ready to unload my gat until it's empty\nI'll never beg a motherfucker for his pardon\nI'd rather see him honored in his new fuckin' bloody garden\n\nAnd after all the fuckin' smoke clears\nI'll be on my way to buy a couple of beers\nAnd if you're black\nYou'll get knocked quick by beefsteak mallets\nI chop and toss punks like salad\nI come equipped with the proper utensils\nTo batter bitches until their bloody phlegm spills\n'cause I'm too paranoid to avoid a massacre\nYou'll be one dead fuckin' passenger\n\nAnd this is a message from Captain Carnage, black\nAnd I'm fuckin' out like fuckin' Kojak\n\n[Chorus, Necro and Captain Carnage]\nDestined to die kid\nDestined to die\nMotherfuckers are just destined to die\nDestined to die kid\nDestined to die\nMotherfuckers are just destined to die\n\n[Necro Verse 1]\n\nMy chrome mag\nWill kill a cock diesel fag\nDon't mean to brag\nBut I'll leave you bloodier than a bitches rag\nNecro slaughters\nNiggas in my gory quarters\nI drink the blood from aortas\nI raped that bitch Crystal Waters\nNo survivor\nThere's signs of sanguinary saliva\nI killed Arnold Schwarzenegger\nThen raped Maria Shriver\nI stick swords\nIn the abdomens of my landlords\nLeaving them crippled\nLike cops that got shot in their spinal cords\nHoles in your fuckin' head\nWhen you get your ass plugged\nElectrocuted dead\nWhen I drop the radio in the bath tub\nConvulsions through your motherfuckin' nerves\nWhen dinner serves\nI'll be eating fuckin' human hors d'oeuvres\nI got vaginal fluid on my knife\nI'm out\nLike the last nut Bobbitt will ever bust\nUsed to rape his wife\n\n[Chorus, Necro and Captain Carnage]\nDestined to die kid\nDestined to die\nMotherfuckers are just destined to die\nDestined to die kid\nDestined to die\nMotherfuckers are just destined to die\n\n[Shout-Outs]\nNecrophiliac is destined to fuck a corpse\nCaptain Carnage is destined to murder\nEl Riz is destined to hustle\nJ.E.Z. is destined to bomb\nGore too is destined to bomb\nDie!\n\nProps out to Necrophiliac for givin' me the beat\nAnd El Riz, for junk gear"}], "artist": "Necro"}
