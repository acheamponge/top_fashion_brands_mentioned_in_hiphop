You understand what I'm saying?\nSo I'm just not afraid of, it's no effect, it's immaterial to me because our enemies are not physical bodies, they are actually our family. They don't know it and we don't always know it\nBut our enemies are not flesh and blood and our problems are not flesh and blood, even though we think they are (think they are, think they are, think they are)"}], "artist": "Teyana Taylor"}
