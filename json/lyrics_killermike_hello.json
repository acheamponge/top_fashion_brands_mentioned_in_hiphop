Remember me?\nI might be gone forever if my hater's prayers succeed\nIf they succeed just let the world know that Michael kept it G\nAnd if you see my haters please tell them this here from me\n\n[Chorus]\nWell hello, well hello, well hello\nWhat it is to my kin and my so-called friends\n'Cause I know, cause I know, cause I know, cause I know\nYeah I know that you thought you'd never see me again\nHere I go, here I go, here I go, here I go\nYeah I'm back in the flesh where them people haven't been\nIt's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay\n'Cause here they all come running back, long time you'll see"}]}
