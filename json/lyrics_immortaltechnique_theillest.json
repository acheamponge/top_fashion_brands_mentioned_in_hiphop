Like you drivin' in a lightning storm\nWith the top down, we got this locked down\nLike convicts on the run, gettin' shot down for phone time\nWe gainin' yards in the whole nine\nSee, me and Tech, we steadily building\nAnd we about to blow like the Oklahoma Federal Building\nAnd all them niggas get mad when we step in the building 'Cause we make the crowd jump\nAnd hit they head on the ceiling, what\n\n[Scratches]\n\n[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]\nI spit heat like the deserts of Saudi Arabia\nBury competition like Mesopotamia\nEmanatin' radiation, pissin' liquid uranium\nI bring the rock like European drunks in soccer stadiums\nI'll split your cranium with perfect symmetry, lyrically\nIf you're not the illest, then you don't deserve to spit with me\nOBS-obliterating bastards sacrilegiously\nI sacrifice niggas who talk shit, ritualistically\nMeticulously makin' all my rivals suicidal\nLike white suburban kids on acid, readin' the Satanic Bible\nMy arrival is genocidal like Christopher Columbus\nExterminatin' races of wack MC's that walk among us\nI've just begun to bust, I'll make this place open candela\nThese racist cops wanna lock me longer then Nelson Mandela\nPissed off, I'm makin' hella paper, East to West Coast\nAnd I treat the law in this country like a motherfuckin' joke\n'Cause if I'm willin' to smoke the President\nWhile he's sniffin' his coke\nYou know it don't mean shit to me to cut a fuckin' cop's throat\n\n[Outro: Immortal Technique]\nJean Grae, Pumpkinhead, Immortal Technique\nDP-one, tell 'em what the fuck we about to do!\n{Sh, sh, sh, shit on the whole industry}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9c9631e16897ed9bc090afd0a05da5ae.1000x974x1.jpg", "album": "Revolutionary Vol. 1", "year": "2001-09-18"}]}
