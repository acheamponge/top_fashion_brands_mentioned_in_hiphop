I'm just sayin like this\nI don't whassup, but\nI think you will understand a little bit more of the situation\nI'mma say like he would say it, on this second part\nSo just check this out aight?\nJust kick it one two three, go head, go head man, go head\n\nHe was a crook -- at the age of nine\nDo whatever it took -- he'll ROB YOU BLIND\nSnatchin pocketbooks, robbin blind ol men\nWay back WHEN.. when he was only ten\nThen when he was in 5th grade, he carried a switchblade\nTried to stay rich to keep him and his bitch paid\nAnd if he ever had to travel somewhere far\nTake a bus? PSSH - HE'D GO STEAL HIM A CAR!\nHe'd always choose to live his life the wild way\nTag?! Russian Roulette is what he'll play\nHis moms and pops told him when he first reached Junior High\nThe way you live determine just how soon you die\nAnd he didn't care because to him it was fun\nAnd he was only THIRTEEN when he got his first gun\nHe robbed stores and did stick-ups frequently\nGave a new name to juvenile delinquency\nAnd yeah you know that, he, was on the go\nSeven days of the week, he kept his pockets full of dough\nBut he was headed for a dead end fast\nCold riskin his ass for petty cash that didn't last\nWent back and forth to jail six times\nFor stolen cars and stick-up and various crimes\nSo when he sit in his cell, he reminisce as a child\nIt don't pay to do crime today, so don't be buck wild..\n\nAy that that that's a little bit of a lesson\nFor all the kids out there you know now\nYeah yeah yeah you know what I'm sayin\nAnd this is comin from\nThe Grand High Exalted Mystic Ruler\nAin't no one cooler\nIn 7th grade I had a teacher named Mr. Dulah\nWho used to wear his pants up to his chest\nAnd I want you to just listen\nCause.. this is no joke, so don't be buck wild.."}], "artist": "Biz Markie"}
