You 'gon deal with it\nAnthro beats is killing it, Eskupe man he's killing it\nThis industry's filled with pricks that tell kids to go pop pills in this\nSo hard to knot your anger when your entire heart's been filled with it\nNo mercy for the ones that called our sons niggas and children spicks\nFuck your code of silence, cause for way too long I've sealed my lips\nI killed for you, killed for moms, I killed for the crew, I killed for this\nDon't make me catch a body, I ain't devour\nI will fill a clip and pull the trigger so motherfucking quick that you won't hear the click\nAnd take your team out one by one till no one knows you still exist\nTell these haters I said fuck 'em, tell Fox News I said fuck em\nMy whole fucking city got my back, ain't backing down for nothing\nBitch I'm coming, yeah bitch I'm coming", "year": "2014-12-10"}]}
