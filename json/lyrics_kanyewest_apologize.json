Yeah I know I'm wrong\nShe's at home alone and I'm always gone\nHate it when she mad but more when she passive\nNow she on the internet looking for classes\nOut of state though, man that hurt, yo\nBut I got work though, and I'm at work, yo\nAnd she don't call a lot\nAnd when she do she pouring out her heart\n\"You never listen to me,\" then the call drop... hmmm\nAnd I promised her everything\nTold her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring\nBut when I got my deal I was back in the ring\nFighting my urges, strip club splurges\nNever had money so I felt like a virgin\nAnd I'm trying to break the bank's cherry\nTryin' to see can I afford Canaries\nWith a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry\nWent from fifty g's to fifteen hundred in a week\nNow I'm trying to call, one ring, two rings, seven rings\nEight rings, er mother picked up the phone\nLike, \"She in school and she don't stay here no more\"\nI guess there's more good women than men percentage wise\nSo her chance of having a husband just minimized\nI guess that's why she says she ain't into guys\nAnd focus on school full-time to improvise\n\n[Chorus]\nWe ball 'til we fall, hit the mall\nAfter we hit, don't call\nWe fill your lives with nothing but lies\nAnd I would like to apologize\nNo no, you can't stand right here\nAnd tell me everything is gonna be alright\n'Cause until that real man stands up\nI'm going to have to improvise"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
