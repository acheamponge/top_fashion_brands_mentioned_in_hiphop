What is it?\nYou got the answer so give it, so give it, so give it\nDon\u2019t lie, what happens when we die?\nDad says, Georgie I\u2019m just guessing from what I\u2019ve been told\nProbably thinking, \u201cHow\u2019d I raise this emo fucking nine-year- old?\u201d\nSince I\u2019m sorta really not religious it\u2019s a crapshoot\nI roll a pair of dice\nAlthough the thought of paradise is very nice\nIn my heart I know I don\u2019t believe in magic\nSo I\u2019m thinking maybe death is like eternal TV static\nOr returning to the state before your birth\nAbsorbed into the earth\nThe fewer hours left the more they\u2019re worth\nI admit that it\u2019s difficult to think about\nI think everybody got a little bit of doubt\nYou don\u2019t get to hide from it even if you shout\nNot a soul on the planet gets to wiggle out\nAnd he said that I know that\u2019s it\u2019s tough to take in son but it\u2019s so early\nI can see you\u2019re in a hurry but don\u2019t worry cause\n\n[Chorus]\nThat isn\u2019t for a long, long time\nThat isn\u2019t for a long, long time\nThat isn\u2019t for a long, long time\nThat isn\u2019t for a long, long, long, long time\n\n[Verse 2]\nLife moves fast\nMade the mistake of blinking, twenty years passed\nNow I\u2019m sitting in my living room in Brooklyn with my father\nWe don\u2019t bother doing Christmas in the Bay any longer\nIt\u2019s first time that we\u2019ve had this conversation\nHe says \u201cIt\u2019s tough to take in\nI know we\u2019re not quite ancient\nBut we\u2019ve reached age where we should probably talk arrangements\nWe could take it several routes\nWe could sell the house\nWe can\u2019t work forever, eventually money will run out\nThat\u2019s a spot taking a loan would help us cover\nWhich would make it tougher to leave something for you and your brother\u201d\nStop\u2014can\u2019t you see?\nEvery meal that you paid for me\nAll this power to chase a dream\nAll this privilege not to crave riches\nBut it\u2019s plain to me the key fact is it\u2019s easy to act like cash means jack shit if\nYou never lacked it\nAnd the greatest honor I could have is to make a buck and pass back a\nFraction of all the happiness you gave to me\nAnd I will never make you live where you don\u2019t aim to be\nAge is just data\nWe paint our story A to Z then dip out\nR.I.P. rip out, we tear out the pages\nTear up the stage and we take a seat\nMaking a vacancy\nFamous or not, we fade from the plot\nEvery day when a new night falls\nI ride around the sun on this big blue ball\nI get a bit further from the kid called Paul\nAnd I get a bit closer to the big brick wall\nBut since inching up to that fence\nI can run my fingers against all the bricks and mortar and sense\nThat it\u2019s not so cold and so dense\nAnd although I\u2019m mournful I\u2019ve known that I\u2019m not immortal\nI\u2019m not banging into stone but I\u2019m more heading through this portal\nWe\u2019re born to return to home we\u2019re all born to be mincemeat\nEverything dies except for Papaya King hotdogs on 86th St\nDad hands me a napkin tells me it\u2019s been the same since the fifties\nHe didn\u2019t always love the city but dammit he\u2019ll miss me\nHow can you miss something after you leave, I agree that it\u2019s sad, but please\nDon\u2019t dwell on it Dad, because\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\nThat isn\u2019t for a long, long time\nThat isn\u2019t for a long, long time\nThat isn\u2019t for a long, long time\nThat isn\u2019t for a long, long, long, long time", "image": "https://images.genius.com/caf3c17709b04ff24300da4d62da46fa.630x630x1.jpg", "album": "x INFINITY", "title": "Lovely Thing Suite: Conversations"}]}
