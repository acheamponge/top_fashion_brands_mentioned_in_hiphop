that Suave House\nCame to turn the motherfuckin' lights out\nNiggas gonna bring the ruckus, no doubt\nSuave House bout to turn the lights out\nI say welcome to that Suave House\nCame to turn the motherfuckin' lights out\nNiggas gonna bring the ruckus, no doubt\nSuave House bout to turn the lights out\n\n[Lokey]\nFirst of all before it starts\nSuave thicker than the Million-Man March\nKhakis starched as I flow through the cut like Noah's Ark\nWho's that slippin' in the dark\nIt's the L-O-K-E-Y\nA killer like Jack the Ripper but slicker than SupaFly\nBull's-eye, stay focused on my green like infrared beams\nLivin' like kings, when Draper put the scientist on the team\nNow it's in my blood stream\nI'm Suave playa till the dusk\nConstruct some murder shit for all my niggas in the cut\n\n[O.C.]\nIt's O.C. the Sinister killin' ya\nHere to administer, with from holy scripts\nReleasin' explicit, miniature scriptures that lift ya mental\nGet into a mind state, niggas fabricate\nSee can they duplicate the shit that we create\nI orchestrate throughout the night and congregate with killers\nWatchin' fake MC's evacuate the premises BLAH it's too late\nAnother murder, no post rate\nFuckin' with this Suave shit flies us around planet as the Earth rotates\n\n[Loc]\nNo doubt, it's Suave House the residence\nIt's evident I represent my click till I'm deceased like dead presidents\nMy regiment is full of soldiers swoopin' like vultures\nThey should've told ya, Loc gon' put it down like he's supposed to\n\n[Khadabi]\nYou niggas peep the game, ain't shit changed\nExcept you small change and you hydroplane\nAnd Suave House niggas we made like stains, on yo bitch's brain\nI coochie for playas with loochie from verbal slang\n\n[Ona-One]\nI'm breakin' niggas like speed limits\nSo hit it before you kick it, think twice if you lick it\nEven you don't wanna risk it\nIf it's dry, twist it, flick it, make me sick with it\nDon't forget your pieces in it, now watch me spit it\nUp and down ya spleen hittin' every nerve like nicotine\nI'm about that cream nigga, save ya dreams and make me scream\nMadam don't give a fuck about nothin' or nobody, not shit\nSo come equipped, you fuckin' sick\nYou cannot get with this, even at the club spot\nWhen orderin' me a drink make sure it's nitro-glycerin on rocks\nYou know that street traffic be drastic\nThat's why I'm not havin' it\nExposin' all you fakers to my Suave click, aww shit\nI'm the first, second, third, fourth, fifth evil bitch\nWith the clip that'll strip you from ya hips\nLeavin' punk niggas with a knuckle print\nSo checkin' chins in the 9-6, this shit is a sinch\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Thorough]\nI crucify clicks like a cult, dialect is difficult\nThe result, mental lock like a dead-bolt\nOn ya cranium, I'm stainin' em' like paintballs\nAin't y'all tired of bein' shot, don't cha' shirt need a wash\nWatch yourself cause Thorough be on the hunt\nPlus him hungry and he know exactly what he want\nPronunciate the poetry that they wouldn't say\nAnd represent the sound that they wouldn't play\nDo away with paper weights with my paper mate\nImmobilize your vibe and paralyze ya rhyme rate\nTake ya conscience and shake it like a nation\nNow ya dumb founded tryin' to find my location\nIt's still Suave House and I'm the first tenant\nBe attentive when I send it or you might not get it\nLimit three and a half mics cause the Source is bias\nBut yet still three and a half mill will buy us\n\n[Hook]\n\n[NOLA]\nLike babies killed in the boat\nAnd this rap fashion shit is blown\nWay outta proportion, Mrs. Incline\nVersace, Armani best wines are fine\nMaterialistic shit we decline\nCause rappers are gettin' weerier\nAll I'm hearin' is the clothing of material\nWe ain't carin' what cha' wearin'\nGangsta niggas live the area\nFill the tech, shall we lecture upon this record\nI keep the Suave House record on ya dresser\nSupposedly, NOLA come one mo' again, cause unknowingly\nYou done fucked up my trees\nLike vegetarians eatin' pork and wine\nBags under mine, receivin' dicks from behind\nBottom line, it's gettin' serrious and furious\nI'm on my period, attitude is rudeness, this the mood bitch\nIt's that Suave click\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Tela]\nNow who's the motherfucker ready to rap and bust a cap\nThe haters want my snap to watch these hoes shit collapse\nA nigga that get in my way get his ass kicked and attacked\nIt's like the loops of the water,Suave started perhaps\nBloody maps, citizen traps, seekin' dress ya can't find\nPuttin' ya bitch in a box who brought you seven different signs\nI'm decomposin' those that's opposin' my rhymes\nI'm leavin' ya ass frozen BING by the corners and lines\nYou actin' bad, motherfucker is you mad\nYo nigga's crew is bad, Tony Draper's runnin' that\nI bring the fuckin' shit that a bitch can't touch\nI'm leavin' ya ass in the gas and blowin' ya fuckin' shit up\nBust, the gravel travels like a travel\nIt ain't reliable, fuck the motherfuckin' outcome\nThat nigga Tela be kind of like raw\nCause I done seen what I saw and now i'm breakin' the law\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Tela"}
