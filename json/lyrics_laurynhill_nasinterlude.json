This is Nas with the official (-), J. Period\n\"If I Ruled the World\" was originally a Kurtis Blow record\nYou know? Somebody who I love and saw him in cr\u00e8che school\nAnd his song wit' \"These are the breaks\"...\nI used to breakdance to his music, you hear what I'm sayin'?\nSo \"If I Ruled the World\" was a tribute to him\nAnd also speakin' out to the world\nAnd, um, I used to work wit' the Fugees on tour\nAnd, you know, they would open up for me wit' our first albums\nAnd our second albums, it flipped\nAnd he sold, like, you know, thirty million albums\nAnd I'm \u2014 now I'm openin' up for them\nSo, um, we was \u2014 we was cool like that\nAnd, you know, Lauryn came and got on the record\nWho I felt was \u2014 would make the record even more incredible\nMe and her, I really appreciate her work\nAnd, um, and talked to her well\nYou know, not just my projects, but every projects in December\nEverywhere in the world\nSo I thought that would be the perfect record\n\n[Outro]\nIf I ruled the world\nStill living for today in these last days and times"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
