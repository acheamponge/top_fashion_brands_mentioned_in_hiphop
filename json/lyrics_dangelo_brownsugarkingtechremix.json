Rap]\nWell it's that street flavor neighbor that I smack upon this track\nSo throw that tobacco outta that Philly, dump in the illy and sit back\nAnd get with bubonic chronic, the pond green bionic\nMy brown eyes get Chinese, high frequencies like Panasonic\nI gets dumb when I hits one, for when you splits one and twists one\nIf you ain't with getting blitzed son then straight up you missed one\nI be high til I die, blowing lye smoke up in the sky\nGetting bumbed from the trum and hella else from chocolate thai\nSo fly the friendly get highs, we wise guys with red eyes\nBigger than life sized, for the pies we terrorize\nWhile getting blunted enemies get hunted, we don't front it\nSon if you want it, it'll be a murder mystery like Whodunit\nSteady, get ready to step to that next level\nFearless like a daredevil, bounce this and pass a sack to the ear level\nSo come get with the program as I slam\nHe run that old flim flam then you can catch a blam blam and I don't give a\nDamn\n\n[D'Angelo]\nNow that be how the story goes\nBrown sugar got me open, now I want some more\nAlways down for a menagie-a-trois\nBut I think I'll hit it solo where my niggas won't mind\nStick out my tounge and I'm about to hit this gritty pretty bitty with\nPersistance\nYo I don't think y'all hear me\nBrown sugar babe, I get high off love, don't know how to behave\n\nI want some of your brown sugar (Repeat 16x, with ad-libs)", "album": "Brown Sugar (Deluxe Edition)", "year": "1995-06-13", "title": "Brown Sugar (King Tech Remix)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8b8aa3565d394dd6a177021767cf79f4.989x989x1.jpg"}], "artist": "D\u2019Angelo"}
