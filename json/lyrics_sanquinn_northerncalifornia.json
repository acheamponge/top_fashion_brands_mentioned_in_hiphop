cranking off the hook\nWhere the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look\n\n[Verse 1]\nToo $hort '85, girl that's your life smoking on that glass pipe\nHad me paying attention my cousin losing weight fast\nLike apartments crooked in Lakeview, Grandma stayed across the street\nPlaying hoop in the gym when I heard the Cougar speak\nVoice deep spitting rap said he was rolling, dippin' sick\nSnakeskin on top of the 'Ville and that was eighty-six\nI was nine, then came eighty-nine\nThen came Richie Rich and D-Loc\nOakland's 4-1-5\nGroupie ass bitch tried to get a baller from the sideshow\nAnd tried to be apart of MC Hammer's stage show\nHammer had MTV locked before Nelly and Will\nI'm telling you this is real\nHe sold seventeen mil\nDigital Underground, Money B, Fuse, and Shock\nRefuel the rap world by introducing Pac\nFrom the same spot slang rocks wrote raps on the same soil\nCheck the next verse I'll spit more game for you\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's Northern California cranking off the hook\nWhere the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look\nThey juke, hit banks and rank high in the pen\nRest in peace to every one that's not here\n\n[Verse 2]\nRichie Rich got cracked early nineties with a half a thing\nHeavy in that rap game still getting that dough\nMC Hammer bought helicopters from the cops from the O\nProbably pushing that shit (shhhh), probably keeping it low\nMac Dre put Vallejo on the map first in The Bay\nYou can tell me something good, if you know what to say\nA Richmond cat named Filthy Phil made player hating a statement\nThen he got even more famous\nWhen he gave it to a cop trying to stop him\nOn some true bay thug shit, pulled his shit quick and popped him\nI watched him on America's Most\nI watched him put out a tape called the Manhunt and the nigga got ghost\nMac Dre still doing his thang, instead his Romper Room gang\nWas robbing banks, media tried to ruin his name\nGot convicted seven year in the feds\nAnd about this time started writing them rhymes\nAnd about this time the year was ninety one\nI'm in the studio laying raps only for fun\nSelling crack doing strong armed robberies at ATM's\nNinth grade high school always in the gym\nMy verses getting props in the bleachers\nSpitting verbal heaters finna be on the shelf next season\nCheck the next verse I got more to say\nAbout the real element going down in The Bay\n\n[Chorus]\nNorthern California where the rappers crooks\nRappers locked down for years got they fame took\nWe made game made niggas put the world in fear\nYou better know that it's real out here\n\n[Verse 3]\nSpice One ninety-one ninety-two had the East Bay shining\nSpitting about that killing that jacking and that grinding\nThen came 40 'I'm tired of being stepped on'\nMr. Flamboyant, here our respect come\n2Pac dropped 2Pacalypse Now, nine-one\nBrenda got a baby girl my age had a son\nReal shit from a real nigga who ya'll mocked\nReal game from a real place it's about to be hot\nSince Too Short we sold tapes out of the trunk\nAnd we never gave parties without having funk\nIt was 40 and The Click, Dru Down and the Luniz\nToo Short and the Dangerous Crew, here come The City\nJT and the G-L-P, RBL Posse, Cougnut, Cellski, and I-M-P\nX-Raided out in Sac, Brotha Lynch, and C-Bo\nTotally Insane, Sean from Palo Alto\nMurder capitol nineteen ninety-two\nYou niggas perpetrate the rhymes I rap are true\nOne cat on Rap-A-Lot named Sea from the East-O\nThe Bay was on fire recognize it my people\nHad deals on the table another verse to write\nLet the world know The Bay is worthy of the hype\nFrom The Bay to Sac, I testify on this track\nSo we can get back on track as I spit these raps\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's Northern California cranking off the hook\nWhere the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look\nThey juke, hit banks, rank high in the pen\nRest in peace to every one that's not here\n\n[Verse 4]\nX-Raided went to jail, for killing somebody's momma\nUp in Sac, with that blood and crip drama\nForty selling thousands of records got a deal with Jive\nWorth about three point five\nDon't give me no bammer weed\nWe don't smoke that shit in the S-F-C\nC-Bo and AWOL playing with change ya'll\nTrips to Atlanta, twenty deep on the plane dog\nJT hooked 4 up with EMI\nWe sat back for a year and we seen him fly\n2Pac sentenced for rape in ninety four\nAfter being shot in skanless ass New York\nMaster P emerging hard up out of Richmond\nPlaying real tough but he's only a sixth man\nLuniz really put your eyes on him\nWhen they dissed him on the flip side of 5 on It\nG-L-P signed in ninety-five along with Master P\nThings about to change fast as can be\n$hort gave a picnic in Fairfield\nNiggas busting a thousand people trying to find a shield\nDeath Row and Southern Cal running the rap game\nNiggas got big deals (while) we fucking off big change\nC-Bo in and out of jail parole violating and such\nThe whole nation is biting our stuff\nFarrakhan Million Man March\nHalf a million guns spark\n2Pac released on bail Suge Knight bought him\nHe told us the east would hate instead of jocking our style\nOn radio shows, commercials knocking us down\nIn the city R-B-L signed a deal at the end of the nine-fifth\nThen Mister C from R-B-L was shot dead\nJanuary first nineteen ninety-six\nAnd they say The Bay isn't sick\n\n[Chorus]\nNorthern California cranking off the hook\nWhere the rappers are affiliated everywhere you look\nThey juke, hit banks, rank high in the pen\nRest in peace to the ones that's not here\n\nComing straight from\nNorthern California where the rappers crooks\nRappers locked down for years got they fame took\nWe made dank, made millions put the world in fear\nYou got to know that it's real out here\n\nIn Northern
