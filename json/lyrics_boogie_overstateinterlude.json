(woah)\nI'm saying I'm patient, now I'm making it urgent\nI fuck up on words, I think that I'm perfect\nFar from it though\nThe verdict is, I don't know what I'm doing\nHow I'm building all this shit that I ruin\nI damn near lose my mind off the shit that I be viewing\nLike the same nails I screwing be the same ones I loosen\nAnd that shit crazy\n\n[Hook]\nIf the Lords put his plans in a paper bag\nPut it all on the land that he made me at\nI think I need to save myself from me\nIf the Lords put his plans in a paper bag\nPut it all on the land that he made me at\n\n[Outro]\nYou don't think none of the girls in the class is cute?\nNo!\nWhy not?\nCause I'm too young", "image": "https://images.genius.com/329e9e692537ac6301adb12b1fef2ab9.300x300x1.jpg"}]}
