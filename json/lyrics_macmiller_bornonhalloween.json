I'm rippin it once, it's hittin you twice\nGhost deliver it nice so take it as a present\nFuck sittin in college, I kick this knowledge for the lesson\nIt burns ya chest, the words are blessed, confuse and bring ya questions\nCause with my complexion, a finger nail can cut the tension\nAnd in case I didn't mention spittin it better than anyone did it before\nI'm rippin your corpse, dippin and lettin you live in the morgue\nShit in the porsche, trick or treat I'm here to piss on the floors\nAnd if I didn't come with the whip I'm gettin in yours\nOn devils night we come to bless this track\nMischief so we rest from raps\nSteal your soul, snatch your heart, laugh and let your chest collapse\nI'm dressed in black, ready to run up inside your crib\nSmack you upside the head while you sittin beside your kid\nI laugh cause your son's in my history class\nMake him cry while he sees his dad kissin my ass\nSpittin razor sharp cancer so I'm pissin out glass\nSit and relax, you bitches stay and live in the past\nAnd hers a toast for me and ghost we be the dopest with this rhyme still\nGhosts raps explode like they running through a mine field\nTime killin itself, clock blowing out his brains\nCause you are the average joes, who goes without a name", "year": null, "album": null, "title": "Born on Halloween"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
