Romero character in reality\nBring your big posse\nYou'll be a bunch of fertilized faggots, like Versace and Liberace\nGet killed in a building, smashing you like Zildjian\nCymbals, bucking you like Brazilian children\nWrite your will out to your attorney\nAfter a weekend at Bernie's you'll be deceased, dead on a gurney\nI rip the beat like the contours of your flesh stripped\nAs you stare, pump gore, it's a trip\nCan't think about food with bullets buried in your belly\nBut notice bloody flesh looks like blueberry jelly\nYou're repulsively corrosive\nYour mother taught you not to get involved with explosives\nSkull opened like Iron Maiden Eddie, kaput, finished\nWanted excitement, you died for it, you pushed it to the limit\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Necro"}
