Like G.5 then the Swaggerville\nI'm like eight miles ahead of rappers, feeling like B. Rabbit feel\nYo, hold up, wait, he had a deal, who said he cannot get a deal?\nThat shit was only half a mill, it's time I need a bigger deal\nHit the store, ship a mill, treat the coupe like Uncle Phil\nBecause it's getting sick of wheels, Zero is the shit for real"}]}
