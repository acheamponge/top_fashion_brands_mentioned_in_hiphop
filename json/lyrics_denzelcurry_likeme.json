Clark + Denzel Curry]\nYou can search, the whole world\nJust to see\nAnd I'll pay, for your trip\nIts on me\nYou might go, your whole life\nJust to find\nOut it was, a complete\nWaste of time\nCoz there ain't no one like me\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga like me\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga no\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga like me\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga no\nCoz there ain't no one like me\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga like me\nAin't there a nigga no, there a nigga\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga like me\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga\n\n[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]\nIt's just, you and I\nAnd God watching over\nKissing on my neck and hands going down my shoulder\nCloser and closer\nYou're feeling a little colder\nMy mind is saying stroke her but I wanna console her\nHold her\nLove is in the eye of the beholder\nShe could be my Sade and I could be her soldier\nTold her\nOnce when we get a little older\nHopefully we'll push a little baby in a stroller\nLower\nIs the tone she whispered in my ear\nShe said \"I love you Denny and I love you near and dear\"\nNever knew Nasir\nBut the words were sincere\nWhen I went inside her mind, it was like Revista Leer\nI read between the lines\nIn her eyes I spot a tear\nI uttered to her softly, girl you have nothing to fear\nI kiss her on the lips\nThen she told me to come here\nAs she climbed to the top\nShe became my chandelier\nNot knowing\nCreated another life this very moment\nThe future of my very insistence's got me open\nIts potent\nLike the smoke, when its in my lungs\nIts a fire in the air\nWith the greeting of the tongues\nBut none\nWill ever come between me and her bond\nSo leave my sanctuary don't come back and don't respond\nThis my garden of Eden\nBut as one this is our temple\nMy miniature moral is more than just being central\n\n[Hook: Steven A. Clark + Denzel Curry]\nYou can search, the whole world\nJust to see\nAnd I'll pay, for your trip\nIts on me\nYou might go, your whole life\nJust to find\nOut it was, a complete\nWaste of time\nCoz there ain't no one like me\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga like me\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga no\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga like me\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga no\nCoz there ain't no one like me\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga like me\nAin't there a nigga no, there a nigga\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga like me\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga\n\n[Outro: Denzel Curry]\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga like me\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga like me, no\nAin't there a nigga, there a nigga"}], "artist": "Denzel Curry"}
