Assume Nervous\nBreak this bitch ass off a bruised purpose\nIn and out throw a fist in the route this bitch has waste management 'cause I piss in her mouth\nMatch made of guinness for forty five minutes\nThen I'm breakin' my foot off her ass for the finish\nLook dingy in Fendi but trendy\nMillenium Ted Bundy lookin all friendly at Wendy's\n'Cause it's time to eat and I'll fuck you up I ain't them rhymin' geeks\n\n[Chorus x2: Copywrite]\nWe want pussy, money and I'm ready for war\nAlready I'm tore still I'm gettin head from your whore\nBring the fun on don't be the we put a gun on\nPromoters that don't gimmie our dough are gettin' swung on\n\n[Verse 2: Cage]\nI can't help that your wife likes sex and the violence\nGot knives to her head while I paint eyelids\nThen cut my ear off Smirnoff get the dead deer off\nThen have that bitch get Lon Ser off\nThen we laugh about it at whatever clubs poppin'\nAnd blow this shit up with all the whores and thugs locked in\nMake it a point to then break in the joint\nSpend a clip on cult members outside waitin' to join\nI'm gettin' this money I don't care how it look\nIf I pick up both arms you're watchin' a coward cook\nRiddled with lead d-cup nipple tip of the egg\nTwelve four watchin' cops itchin' their head\nSippin' grey goose with a trey deuce\nOn this kid that runnin' this dough and I'm like 'lay loose'\nDon't have your moms be like, 'That's my boy!'\nThen go sign the papers to have your corpse destroyed\n\n[Chorus x2: Copywrite]\nWe want pussy, money and I'm ready for war\nAlready I'm tore still I'm gettin head from your whore\nBring the fun on don't be the we put a gun on\nPromoters that don't gimmie our dough are gettin' swung on\n\n[Verse 3: Cage]\nYou better got rocks to fling or Glocks to ping\nFuck around and got Cage doin' obnoxious things\nNow it's four AM where your kids at Larry Clarke's crib\nWith Copywrite next to where the PTA live\nWent to see Bully not for my two songs maybe up\nCameo with Bijou Phillips lady up\nThis time around crazy I'm slicin' shook rookies\nUsed to pistol whip 'til Shady made it look pussy\nTryin' to dissect words I write\nOnly found a napkin in the diner for the verse I wrote last night\nSo don't pick up bread crumbs\nLike this old bitch sittin' shoddy in the NIS gun\nYou get the point like your bitch do\nI punch through the planet like when PCP hits you\nWatch me shake up these little prima donnas\nCuttin' off their backpacks like Mad Cow Llama\n\n[Chorus x2: Copywrite]\nWe want pussy, money and I'm ready for war\nAlready I'm tore still I'm gettin head from your whore\nBring the fun on don't be the we put a gun on\nPromoters that don't gimmie our dough are gettin' swung on"}]}
