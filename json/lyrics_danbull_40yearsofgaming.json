I bought stories of another time\nAnd point-and-click arrived from the shores of Monkey Island\nEver want to see your chums beat right up?\nWell, Daniel-san, you need to try Street Fighter\nA tournament with all your buddies in your front room\nIs all good until you fight online on Doom\nHijack your mind, your momma can't abide this\nNight Trap might lack morals, it's a moral crisis\nWhat are we doing to our youth?\nThey're shooting people\nGlued to screens with superglue\nComputers need to be banned when the laws broke\nBan Manhunt\nBan Grand Theft Auto\n\nTry something musical, but if you have a sore throat\nI have what you're after\nParappa the Rapper\nTomb Raider, the tune invades your brain\nGet in her way and she'll make you taste the pain\nA sports a game always and it's hard fact\nThen a game became a sport and its name was Starcraft\nKids used to play with dolls and a house\nThe Sims is the same, but controlled with a mouse\nOpen worlds abound, but rarely 3D, hey\nUntil the Elder Scrolls and GTA\nWait 'til you see the scale of the monsters and bosses\nThat you face in Shadow of the Colossus\nThings are getting bigger, more decisions, more maps\nMillions of simultaneous players in Warcraft\nAll the people\nSo many people\nSee, your whole family can get involved in Wii Sports\nAnd more people means more money, more flair\nFor big blockbusters\nCOD: Modern Warfare\nEven more people, more freedom, more Indie games\nLimbo, Fez, Super Meat Boy, Braid\nRevolutionizing gameplay\nA mind blast\nConstructing infinite destructible worlds\nMinecraft\nGaming on the telephone, yes I know it sounds absurd\nFruit Ninja, Farmville, Angry Birds\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen gamers came along, the planet laughed at us\nBut this is gaming in the future and you haven't heard the last of us\nDismissing this is just an enormous fallacy\nSo open your mind, and let it alter your reality\n\nWhen gamers came along, the planet laughed at us\nBut this is gaming in the future and you haven't heard the last of us\nDismissing this is just an enormous fallacy\nSo open your mind, and let it alter your reality\n\nWhen gamers came along, the planet laughed at us\nBut this is gaming in the future and you haven't heard the last of us\nDismissing this is just an enormous fallacy\nSo open your mind, and let it alter your reality\n\nWhen gamers came along, the planet laughed at us\nBut this is gaming in the future and you haven't heard the last of us\nDismissing this is just an enormous fallacy\nSo open your mind, and let it alter your reality\n\nWhen gamers came along, the planet laughed at us\nBut this is gaming in the future and you haven't heard the last of us\nDismissing this is just an enormous fallacy\nSo open your mind, and let it alter your reality\n\n[Outro]\nGamers\nThe world is ours\nNow, where shall we take it?", "year": "2014-07-03"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
