Let It Snow! Let It\u2005Snow!\nOh, it doesn\u2019t show signs of stopping\nAnd I've brought some corn for popping\nThe lights are turned way down low\nLet It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\nWhen we finally kiss goodnight\nHow I'll hate going out in the storm!\nBut, if you really hold me tight\nAll the way home I\u2019ll be warm!\nThe fire is slowly dying\nAnd my dear, we're still good-by-ing\nBut, as long as you love me so\nLet It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It snow!\nOh, it doesn't show signs of stopping\nAnd I've brought some corn for popping\nSince the lights are turned way down low\nLet It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\nWhen we finally say goodnight\nHow I'll hate going out in the storm!\nBut, if you'll really hold me tight\nAll the way home I'll be warm!\nOh, the weather outside is frightful\nBut the fire is so delightful\nAnd since we've no place to go\nLet it snow! Let it snow, Let it snow!\nLet it snow! Let it snow! LET... IT ... SNOW!", "title": "Let It Snow", "album": "Christmas EP"}], "artist": "Aloe Blacc"}
