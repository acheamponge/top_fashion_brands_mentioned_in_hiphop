Who's injecting our seeds with greedy eyes\nAnd feeding minds sugar coated poison, disguised as vitamins\nVital signs of the times are evident, most are hesitant\nTo realize, the seven headed dragon spitting fire speaking lies\nBut I will rise, receive the spiritual prize\nAnd not waste my life chasing temporary highs\n\nWe, struggle and fight, through the dark of night\nAnd the sharks that bite will give you scars for life\nSee the stars and stripes, we salute\nA never ending pursuit of truth it's true\nThe permanent we're after, persevere when disaster strikes\nShining light when we're smashing, smashing MICs\nAnd stay focused on the after, after life\nCause if it won't last it's not worth the price\n\nCount the cost, I'm gonna make this life count, before I'm down for the count\nCount the cost, we're gonna make this life count, before we're down for the count", "year": null, "album": "Shades of Grey"}], "artist": "Braille"}
