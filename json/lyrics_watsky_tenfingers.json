But I've I think we'd be friends\nIf he went to my school and was cool and we kicked it in chem\nI've never kissed a dude (Eww); well, that's partly true\nAre we counting Spin the Bottle at a cast party too?\nOh my God, so gay! Pause\nTick-tick-tick-tick, press play\nI've never raved, I've never been Tased\nNever maced, or been maced, or been punched in the face (Not yet)\nNever have I ever contemplated suicide, or been crucified\nNever have I ever mooned another driver from the side of my hooptie ride (Woop-woop!)\nNever have I ever swallowed all my foolish pride\n(Womp-womp) And I can't really tell\nIf I'm a good person or I'm faking really well (Not yet, not yet)\n'Cause every now and then I'd catch her on the phone\nBut I never really went to visit grandma at the home\nAnd I've always known that I won't be happy\nUntil I'm the best version of myself when I'm alone\nSo fuck thinking of marriage\nUntil I learn to put another person first and be a parent\nI pinky-swear it\n\n[Hook]\nI don't know much, I\nI won't know much, I\nI won't know much until I\nUntil I know myself\nI know I don't know much, I\nKnow I don't know much, I\nKnow I won't know much until I\nUntil I know myself\nI know I don't know much, I\nKnow I don't know much, I\nKnow I won't know much until I\nUntil I know myself...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c29f84b2362a2e43218c9c9f8eb13126.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "A New Kind of Sexy", "title": "Ten Fingers"}]}
