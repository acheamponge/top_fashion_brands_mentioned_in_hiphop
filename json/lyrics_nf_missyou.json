Sick o' dwellin' on the negative\nUse what you love, it'll will take you where you never been\nYo, depression, naw, far from it\nHave I cried? Oh, yeah, I've done it\nIf I could I'd change, and I'd go back\nProblem is if we could, yeah, we'd all do that\nI can see you laughin' in my memories\nSad part is that's the only thing I'll ever see\nUsed to wear a tough face and play pretend\nNow the fact is I'm never going to see you again\nSee, my life just doesn't seem right without ya\nI can feel the tears comin' when I think about ya\nMatter fact, I think I feel some now\nI'm sick of holdin' them back, that's why I'm lettin' them out\n\n[Chorus]\nI never thought I'd have to say goodbye to you so soon\nBut now you're gone (And now you're gone)\nAnd now you're gone (And now you're gone)\nI never thought I'd have to say goodbye but now I do\nAnd I miss you (And I miss you)\nOh, I miss you (Oh, I miss you)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI look in the mirror, I can see you in my face\nI could care less now about your mistakes\nNot 'cause they don't bother me, not 'cause they ain't bruise me\nI just kinda feel like you ain't never knew me\nI'm all mixed up, lost in the emotion\nLoved you so much, too bad I never showed it\nYeah, but on the upside there's one thing\nYou put a smile on my face most times I sing, so\nMom, if you were here today, I would put my arms around you\nAnd tell you I love you, yeah\nI'd tell you I love you, I'd tell you I love you\nYeah, I would put your hand in mine, and tell you everything's okay\nOh, I miss you\nOh, I miss you, yeah, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI never thought I'd have to say goodbye to you so soon\nBut now you're gone (And now you're gone)\nAnd now you're gone (And now you're gone)\nI never thought I'd have to say goodbye but now I do\nAnd I miss you (And I miss you)\nOh, I miss you (Oh, I miss you)\n\n[Outro]\nLa da da\nLa da da da da\nLa da da\nLa da da da da"}], "artist": "NF"}
