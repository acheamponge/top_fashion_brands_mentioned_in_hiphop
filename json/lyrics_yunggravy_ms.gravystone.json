WHOOAA\nLate night stealthy\nHitting up that deli cause you know I'm mighty healthy\n\n[Verse 5: Mia Gladstone]\nVegan bitches everywhere\nScreaming gravy touch me there\nRun your fingers through my hair.. uh uh\nThey be busting out the whip, on that mother daughter trip\nThrew some dressing in the mix.. GRAVY\n\n[Verse 6: Yung Gravy]\nFirst thing told her we should try to keep it low key\nBut then I sang that bitch some Ginuwine on karaoke\nHer ex pulled up in the camouflage oakleys\nHave to break it you, you a real bad goalie\nYou deserve a trophy, for being straight baloney\nI've been getting cozy with yo girl watching MOFY\nPull up on yo bitch with my snorkel and my floaties\nThen I hit her with the horizontal hokey pokey .. AH SHIT\n\n[Chorus: Mia Gladstone & Yung Gravy]\nGravy got the juice, got the sauce, he got everything\nYou can't top it off, no\nGravy bring the weed roll the blunts\nWe be over here smoking on some loud now\n\nBaby Gravy I was grocery store flexing\nBut then I saw a baddie in the vegetable section\nAye, booty game vicious\nCouldn't find the gravy so I gave her some assistance", "title": "Ms. Gravystone"}]}
