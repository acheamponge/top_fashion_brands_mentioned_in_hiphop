Check it out\nWhat about that dummy, that one that got hooked on marijuana\nGot her budded, and she nutted, we both was in the sauna\nOne nigga mobbed to the store for ya Donna\nWell clean the wax out ya ears and hear the drama\nCuz I'mma tell it the way it couldn't be told\nSold it the way it couldn't be sold\nNigga who you talkin' bout? Bout these young sweet hoes\nSo tick tock, it don't stop the hustle\nDonna went down lip locked on my love muscle\nI'm JB the Beta manipulator, let me begin\nIf my dick is in your mouth then my balls is on your chin\nBalls is on your chin, the pubic hairs is up your nose\nI'm that nigga that gives and you that nigga that blows\n\nCHORUS\n\n(Brotha Lynch):\nAround the corner from me\nLight skinned, packed, she stood\nMuggin' like a maniac in a straight jacket\nIt was on and crackin'\nKnowin' I shouldn't be late night fuckin' with that shit\nBut I was off this Perry Mason bout to act like Jason\nIt was Friday the 13th, my day to work meat\nA pack of Blacks, and a half a 20 sac of the Thai and some O.E\nYou know me, I fuck long and nut long\nHit you in the face with some of that silky\nHot and sicc and make you mind strong\nGrab your knees and let me lean back\nI'ma grip your clit with my lips\nAnd motivate, coordinate 'g' shit\nSpeak Japanese up in your shit\nWatch it all ease up out your shit\nAnd we did it, and did it, and did it......\n\nCHORUS", "year": "1997-09-16", "album": "Loaded"}], "artist": "Brotha Lynch Hung"}
