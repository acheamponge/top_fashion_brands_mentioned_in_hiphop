You made me crazy\nEverytime I smoked, it looked like everyone was bald\nI could see my insecurities depicted in the fog\nRun run rabbit, don't follow the clock\nTic-tac totally, undermining your thoughts\nI need more exes, I need more hoes\nI need less contentment, I need more clothes\nRun run rampant, vapid, acid, candid\nSmell too loud, my family couldn't stand it\nA little weed is a little more love\n\n[Hook 1]\nSweet Mary, Mary Jane\nSweet Mary, Mary Jane\nSweet Mary, Mary Jane\nI love you, I love you\n\n[Hook 2]\nSour patch, lemon drop\nBubble Gum, cherry pop\nSwisher cocoa blanket, you done gone\nAnd got me faded again\n\n[Hook 3]\nOo-wee oo-wee, doobie doobie\nI break the law, I smoke my weed\nI had to stop 'cause I hate to tweak\nBet next week I'mma do it again\n\n[Verse 2]\n14 hours\n14 blunts like a morphine shower\nYou ain't ready for that\nYou ain't re-writing Leviticus and call it a rap\nAlphabet, Alcatraz, I'mma letter the map\nAnd national caps, I'm cheifin'\nWhere the governors at?\nI know 14 ghosts and they chasin' the pack\nThat ain't shit to coy with, shit to toy with\nThese paper airplanes made a beautiful joystick, oo\nSmokin' a cloud, throw in the towel\nBoxed in, boxed out, Mr. Pacqui-di-ao\nPack of the loud, good as it gets\nCouple of hits\nOne more cypher, then I'm callin' it quits\n\n[Hook 1]\nSweet Mary, Mary Jane\nSweet Mary, Mary Jane\nSweet Mary, Mary Jane\nI love you, I love you\n\n[Hook 2]\nSour patch, lemon drop\nBubble Gum, cherry pop\nSwisher cocoa blanket, you done gone\nAnd got me faded again\n\n[Hook 3]\nOo-wee oo-wee, doobie doobie\nI break the law, I smoke my weed\nI had to stop 'cause I hate to tweak\nBet next week I'mma do it again\n\n[Outro]\nA little weed is a little more love\nBet next week I'mma do it again\nA little weed is a little more love\nBet next week I'mma do it again"}], "artist": "Noname"}
