Nutzbaby...\nMy like I ain't tell you from the jump brotha\nDon't judge me 'cause of this baby...Let me know!\n\n[Forte' 1st Verse]\nEl Capitan first name John\nSwift on\nYou foes only do shows with new kicks on\nToe toes with my brother\nPass the Grey Poupon\nHoe cronies I don't know what the fuck y'all on\nSo long, a brother gone\nLearn it in quote\nI want a sista man, my beat Jamaicans rock on flows\nLaugh now, you know The Score\nBefore I killed The Carnival\nDon't stop\nYou knew me before the solo record dropped\nWhat?! I'm into passing on\nMovin' slow, inter - national\nSince I fork through the dough\nCalled my first girl a hoe, 'cause I sweat her\nNow I know better, to let it flow, like I never met her\nAnd let the show tour broads quick to fuck a man, in the spotlight\nThat's why I maintain the upperhand\nDamn! You know the half\nShit is straight, 'til I turn it\nWho fresh? You gonna blow it? Only if you know it!\n\n[Jeni Fujita Singing Chorus (Forte' in parentheses)]\nIf you want it, we got it! (You got The Right One, baby!)\nYou got The Right One, baby!\nIf you want it, we got it, decide it! (You got The Right One, baby!)\nYou got The Right One, baby!\nIf you want it, we got it! (You got The Right One, baby!)\nYou got The Right One, baby!\nIf you want it, we got it, decide it! (You got The Right One, baby!)\nYou got The Right One, baby!\n\n[Forte - 2nd Verse]\nWell it ain't nothing but a word\nThe noise I heard, could make a crew want to shoot up every party and slide\nLike I'm supposed to show you love to try to get inside\nClub promoters 'fessin' with their little guest lists\nSleek, I'm twenty deep\nAll brothers in fact, now the line start with me, and it ends in the back\nYou don't love me, I know you like the record!!! Don't touch me!!!\nNiggas stay wack, like crack, in the dutchee\nSo why try me?\nSwift, I sure do be\nYou get touched more than frisked by club security\nLovely, what it look like?\nMy sons run stuff\nEvery time I touch a mic you want to, \"Throw Guns Up!\"\nHard to follow\nHere to swipe the next man's dollar\nCrimes, white collar\nUnderground, like Kabala\nYou know the effort, all you do is make a record\nYou silly, like Milli's, we spray the milliseconds! What?!\n\n[Chorus]\n[Forte']\nDirty Cash, baby!\n[Prakazrel \"Pras\"]\nCheck it, Check it!\nI got The Right One\nThe only one\nAllstars, ichi bang (Japanese for number one Rap Song)\nNiggas running up saying, \"Pras, put me on!\"\nHear my song\nSing along\nPass it on\nCapitan\nAnd Dirty Cash, 'til November we'll be gone!\nBust it!\n[Forte' & Jeni - Singing]\nAin't no moonshine last that long!\n[Forte]\nAround Mr. John\nI hater mackin' you\nRappers do like stone\nOn the don\nYou embarrass me, more than chaperones at the prom\nYou rappers in the stall, is a ball, be gone!\nYou ain't never knew the truth, so don't get me wrong!\nYou know how we do, spot it, then I spit it, and lock it!\nEl Capitan, you want it? I got it!\n\n[Chorus]\n[Jeni Singing]", "year": null}]}
