OP    on the C\u2014ops\n\nBlow spots, capsize boats, shipwreck yachts\nHeadshots hit you with 300 nautical knots\nYou calling the cops complaining about the hip hop\nGettin benjmanis like the L-ocks; it don\u2019t stop\nEh-eh-eh-eh  put away your burners/ You can't serve us\nMy whole camp is allergic to being murdered\nMetaphors are proof\nI got more than just a couple screws loose\nLatinos call me da black Jesus\nSo all who believe in telekenesis and Jesus\nI'll touch a parapalegic and heal him"}]}
