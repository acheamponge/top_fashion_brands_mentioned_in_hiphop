Love you enough to tell you the truth\nCouldn't, say it in person, hope its felt from the booth\nWith every heartbeat your still a part of me\nI pray that you turn today with (incomprehensible) the Lord and me\n\nI know it's hard to see, but God He wants to heal you life\nRight now you only breath, God He wants to heal you life\nBut you won't find it if you trustin' in things\nTrust me, you'll only find it if you trust in the King\n\nMama, besides my wife you're the closest person to me, though I lack to express this\nYes I regret it, cause you should know your highly respected\nI love you deeply, and if I had to give you a life description\nYou're a realist, and a strong woman despite your addiction\n\nI see my need for your forgiveness the more I embrace the Book\nCause I didn't paint the whole picture in this song come take a look (I'm sorry)\nIn fact it was my selfishness and desire for things\nThat made me resent you and not truly see you as a queen (you are)\n\nAnd I apologize with feelings too sincere to describe\nI pray you're hearing my cries, I write with tears in my eyes\nFor the past years I've cried, the hardest thing in my life\nIs to give the Gospel to my mother, see you surrender to Christ\n\nThroughout your life you been through a lot that were heartache and pain\nYou lost a daughter in the game ma, its time for a change\nIt's plan I wrote this to say I love you and all\nBut my deepest desire is to see you come to the Lord\n\nI love you I do! Love you enough to tell you the truth\nCouldn't, say it in person, hope its felt from the booth\nWith every heartbeat your still a part of me\nI pray that you turn today with (incomprehensible) the Lord and me\n\nI write to you both, because I know we rarely had a time to talk\nAnd when we do its hard to say to you what's truly on my heart\nI felt pressed by the Lord with a need to address it\nPlus if I love you how can I not share with you the Gospel message?\n\nIt's deeper than you being my mother, bigger than you being my fam\nWe're talking God, Creator of the seas and the land\nMan has a problem with Him \u2018cause of our sin\nWe can't change on our own \u2018cause we're in love with our sin\n\nBut, God sent His Son to live the perfect life we couldn't live\nJesus Christ gave the sacrifice we couldn't give\nHis arms are open to show you what life's meaning is\nThere's none righteous, that's why we in need of His\n\nWhat's grieving is you don't truly see that He's the treasure\nYou put your hope in things, they won't bring eternal pleasure (Why?)\nGod loves you I hope you hearing the call\nCause my deepest desire is to see you come to the Lord\n\nI love you I do! Love you enough to tell you the truth\nCouldn't, say it in person, hope its felt from the booth\nWith every heartbeat your still a part of me\nI pray that you turn today with (incomprehensible) the Lord and me\n\nI love you I do"}], "artist": "Json"}
