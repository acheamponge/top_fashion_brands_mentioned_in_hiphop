outfit, welcome to the viewing\nYou just run your mouth slick, fuck you niggas doing?\nShe popped that ass for the skrilla\nHe sling that crack for the skrilla\nShe want that bag, that's a killer\nWe drop that cash to the dealer\nI got my hustle from the Westside, got my game from the Eastside\nRep this bitch so hard, put my name on the street sign\nMade it out, got the guap, copped a phantom, ride a block\nGet the fucking money round the clock, you heard\nAnd I know they looking 'cause they see me cooking\nI'm about to hook a nigga, catch me at the top, you heard\n\n[Hook]\nWhole city

that juice box, I got that 2Pac\nWe watching Juice in a blue drop\nMy rollie is cool, but my pool hot\nMy block is on fire, my heart cold\nThe [?] on my cartier is all gold\nGangster don't come with a bar code\nMy bars cracking, in my cars dope\nI'm a boss back in my condo\nGarage that shit look like a car show\nDon't hit the club if they book a nigga I'ma have it looking like a toy show\nI'm pulled up in a Royce though, I ain't really had a choice bro\nNever been a fan of police, 'til the devil let my boys go\nOkay, okay, okay, I'm off the rhythm, boss' me\nWiping lipstick off my cheek, baby girl you crazy girl but you can get this sauce for cheap\nMade it out, got the guap, copped a phantom, ride a block\nGet the fucking money round the clock, you heard\nAnd I know they looking 'cause they see me cooking\nI'm about to hook a nigga catch me at the top, you heard\n\n[Hook]\nWhole city Gucci 'cause I'm the new Juiceman\nI'm the new Juiceman\nI'm the new Juiceman\nAll my bitches Tropicana, they call me the Juiceman\nThey call me the Juiceman\nThey call me the Juiceman\nWhole squad vegan, you know we be juicin'\nWhole squad vegan, you know we be juicin'\nI could get the plug for you, they call me the Juiceman\nWhole city Gucci 'cause I'm the new Juiceman\nI'm the new Juiceman, I'm the new Juiceman\nI'm the new Juiceman, I'm the new Juiceman\nI'm the new Juiceman, I'm the

flex wave\nFast forward to my next wave\nGirl that pussy like a rose petal\nLeave some flowers on your ex-grave\nThis my break these niggas next wave\nThis my take these niggas checks wave\nGet the cash and hit the hideaway\nHit the Apple like a Tidal way\nRun for cover ain't no hideaway\nMotherfuckers know that I'm the way\nSick and tired of all these pussy niggas\nThinking you juicin', wanna push me nigga?\nNiggas basic they gon' make me take 'em through the Matrix\nUse to sleep in niggas basement, now we racing back to back\nAnd racing racing, toast to saying God is great, is all patience to\nMake a nigga wanna ride, when it get like this I niggas wanna hide\nI'm sick of pussy nigga with ridiculous facades\nDo know you know how many bitches wanna kick it with this guy?\nI can feel it your vibe from the wink in your eyes\nYou finna get surprise, I can't wait when we collide\nI'ma get 'em face to face and I'ma take 'em for the ride\nCan't do top-down, bumping Mase in the ride\nI've been cooking in the kitchen whipping bass for the gods\nMade it from the bottom, I was facing the odds\nNow I'm looking at my son, I see my face in his eyes\nAnd it ain't a surprise with my name in the sky\nShe thinks I'm rich for my chain and my watch\nI say I'm rich 'cause my pain is reflective\nAnd yes I'm just blessed 'cause I'm claiming my spot\nCame from the bottom to aim for the top\n\n[Hook]\nNow my whole city Gucci 'cause I'm the new Juiceman\nI'm the new Juiceman\nI'm the new Juiceman\nGirl I could get it juicy, your boy is not a Juiceman\nHe's not a Juiceman, he's not the Juiceman\nFuck these niggas doing? This shit get confusing\nWhole city Gucci, they know I got the Juiceman\nWhole city Gucci, they know I got the Juiceman\nWhole city Gucci, they know I got the Juiceman"}]}
