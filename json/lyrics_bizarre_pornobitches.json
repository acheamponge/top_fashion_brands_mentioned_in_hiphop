I took... vaseline\nEven though it was thick and rubbed it on my dick\nNow I'm grown...\n... and my bone is so well-known hoes wanna get it cloned\nShit, ain't nothin wrong with you chunkin that monkey\nAll up on me 'til the whole room's funky\nThe negative thoughts, it's time to change\nShit, you a woman, I'm a man\nIt's all natural, and we're compatible\nI'll bend you over, knock you down, slap that ass a little bit\n(ohh ohh) But not to hurt\nLike after havin a full course meal, it's the dessert\nNow lay on your stomach, put a arch in your hips\nAnd look back so I can see all four of them lips\n\n\n[Hook] w/ ad libs\n\n[Verse 2 - Bizarre]\n{\"Bizarre..\"}\nI can on Superman drawers, I'm 6 years old\nAll in my room, all alone\nI'm young, dumb, layin the pipe\nShowtime, HBO, Friday night\nButt-naked on the couch, without no clothes\nRemote control, ready to bust a load\nAnd fuck Roxanne, I want Big Ann\nTight old pants, my mother's best friend\nI watch all your movies and your DVD's\nI heard you're comin out with a porno CD\nI want Janet Jacme, to smack me\nTake your bikini off, get on the bed and attack me\nI love porn, but niggas be hatin\nR. Kelly ain't got nothin on the shit I be makin (I'm 14!)\nI'm a freak, I been that way since 7\nMe, Big Boi and Devin; bitch is 11\n\n[Hook] w/ ad libs\n\n[Verse 3 - Big Boi]\n{\"Big Boi, from OutKast..\"}\nI like a lady, but I sure love a slut\nThe type that like to sit on my dick and let me scrub them guts\nThe chick that want it doggystyle while pullin on my nuts\nAnd when you aimin for her face shorty don't be tryin to duck, uh\nTrue Aquarian, mean I'm freaky as to fuck\nEat that coochie for an hour after you shower cock 'em up\nFrom the power of the orgasm your legs are lockin up\nCaught a cramp in your thigh, can't even pull your stockings up\nBut your spike leather collar plus stilletos lookin tough\nNow you're passed out on your stomach, seems though you had \"Enough\"\nLike J-Lo in that movie where her husband beat her up (bitch!)\nPuss appears to be pregnant, swole and wet up\nNow you need to go on and get up 'fore I set up some more setup\nI done caught my second wind, let's begin, lift your head up\nIt's the battle of the sexes, we can do this shit 'til breakfast\nI don't want no mo' babies but I can give you a baby necklace\n\n[Hook] w/ ad libs"}], "artist": "Bizarre"}
