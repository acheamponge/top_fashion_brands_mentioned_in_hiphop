Rap]\nYo, I come in the form of danger lurkin'\nBlastin' a mag, strange and murkin'\nShot at strangers from out the Ranges and Suburbans\nCurtains for anybody perpin'\nLeavin' 'em hurt for certain\nBlood on the curb, with bandages like turbans\nWe roll the durban\nAll in this dirt, puffin' the herb and\nWe bring the verbs in\nDouble action's loaded with Germans\nArea's urban, block's hot where we be swervin'\nGun fights strike like a serpent\nLeave your nerves jerkin'\nLay down any person\nStrictly for just target rehearsin'\nThe skills remain tight as Holy Mary the Virgin\nSlowly carry the burden\nSo we varied the shit you heard an'\nHit you with the different methods and versions;\nWe simply\nLet bullets rip until the clip is empty\nGet laid in your tracks as if you was SMPTE\nHit you like Jack Dempsey\nThe MAC-packin' emcee, with gats clappin' like an M.P\nOpen your friendly wimpy, frame like a M.D\nBlow you until your block's windy\nBe on sort of a shot frenzy\nMy Glocks don't stop 'til the cops hem me\nBlow only hollow tops in me\nHazardous shit - guns is accurate\nSendin' niggas to meet the King of Nazareth\nPlayin' me close has a risk\nI bash cliques like they was masochist\nBlast the tear gas, thinkin' I'm pacifist\nPass the fifth\nOne last kiss before your ass is missed\nThese bastards is gettin' clapped by the strapped activist\n\nChorus: Kool G. Rap (repeat 2X)\n\nYo, let the games begin\nThe Tec and MAC-10 flames begin\nThugs to the end, my whole crew insane with sins\nHammers to firing pins\nMe and my kin be makin you spin\nThe Lord or The Devil be takin' you in\n\n[Kool G. Rap]\nIt's the Corona Queens apocalypse\nMy block is hit with the dark eclipse\nTaking the hostages\nSo grab the Glocks and clips\nThe rap's apostle-ist, Big as the Loch Ness\nLarge as Colossus is\nMarvelous shit\nGet shot at the esophagus\nThe Thug Saga novelist\nSexin' this rap shit; monogamous\nRainin' like the tropics, while you be topic-less\nBlood money monopolist - do it for eons\nShinin' like it's, neon - heart colder than freon\nDecidin' which emcee to pee on;\nBaby cause that's the shit that we on\nNiggas go to Warrick like Dionne\nPut the G on\nI analyze guys with Montana eyes\nTo vandalize any man alive, soon as the hammer rise\nCut em down like samurais\nKickin' that real shit that you fantasize\nNiggas step aside and recognize\nG; the real cat, pack a steel gat, baby feel that\nLeave you layin flat witcha shit clapped and peeled back\nBattle-actin' rap; shit'll put you in back of a Cadillac\nA bad decision; fuck up your whole vision like cataracts\nRed roses on a dead foe\nLayin' in wet clothes from head blows\nYour whole brain be exposed\nGet your body torn out the frame from lead throws\nNone of my victims ever bled slow\nStiff as Edgar Poe, that's how it go\n\nChorus: Kool G. Rap (repeat 2X)\n\nYo, let the games begin\nThe Tec and MAC-10 flames begin\nThugs to the end, my whole crew insane with sins\nHammers to firing pins\nMe and my kin be makin you spin\nThe Lord or The Devil be takin' you in"}]}
