By Jahosh]\n\n[Intro]\nJust turned twenty, twenty\nLike Diane Sawyer\n\n[Verse: 1]\nJust turned veinte\nTrying to get bigger than a venti\nTrying to get the bucks of a star\nMy latin girl said I need to stack plenty\nJahosh playing prophets trying to get some profit\nThese dumb things give a nigga a lot of knowledge\nWallet looking thinner than Conan O'brien\nBut this atom finna blow like I was in science\nLook baby I don't do love\nMatter fact shawty I don't even do hugs\nYou ask a nigga why and I say just because\nYou get too attached and then you blame it on some love\nLike I said who you know like me?\nN\u00e9 prolly need a Blake Lively\nN\u00e9, N\u00e9 prolly need a new new\nSee I've been feeling Gucci while they looking Fubu\n\n[Verse: 2]\nNever claim you the realest in the room\nCause if you ain't nigga it'll show like\nA flower when it blooms\nOr a tower when it falls\nOr a chick that say she virgin but she always on her back with no drawers\nShawty said I'm too young for her\nI told her \"Baby I just turned twenty\"\nLet me hit it\nNow I'm done with her\nNow I'm done with her\nI've been on the go\nAnd she just wants some more\nTell me what you want\nTell me what you need\nI've been on the go\nTrying to get it quicker in a nigga Sono\nIf you ain't with it Shawty I may have to go\nBut your wah gwaan to a bad man I don't know\nI just turned veinte\nFeeling bigger than a venti\nTrying to get the bucks of a star\nMy latin girl said I need to stack plenty"}]}
