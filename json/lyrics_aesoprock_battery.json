{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Aesop Rock]\nYo change the fucking channel\nI burn a Coma candle\nWhen the flame fades, consider my flatline a soldier's sample\nWe them cats talking noise behind that New York trash heap\nWhere the stench of commuter briefcase replaces a bad sleep\nAnd it's, worker zig-zagers versus piggy badge flashers\nTraining Generation Fallout\nWaterfall bricklayer pincushion crawl out\nThere's smoke in my iris\nBut I painted a sunny day on the insides of my eyelids\nSo I'm ready now (What you ready for?)\nI'm ready for life in this city\nAnd my wings have grown almost enough to lift me\nI'm a dinosaur with Jones Beach in my hourglass\nPassing the time with serial killer coloringbooks and bags of marbles\nDon't tell me you ain't the droid that held the match to the charcoals\nDon't tell me Lucifer and God don't carpool\n(This is our school)\nI'm not trying to graduate to life at the personalized barstool\nHead in a jar on the desk, feet dangling in a shark pool\n(Man please) Man please\nMy name stands for my being\nAnd my being stands for the woman who stood\nAnd braved the storm to raise the seedling\n(Brother, sun, sister, moon, mother beautiful)\nYeah middle sibling suitable but far from son of excellence\nBack in a long time ago, I was to way the wishes wish\nBut missers miss, I slept through my appointment\nSaw the liquid dreams of a thousand babies solidify\nAnd picked the rose that wilted\nThe second I introduced myself as Nervous\nWell it appears the scars of learning have spoken\nSome are burning, some have frozen\nSome deserve tall tales, some wrote them\nSome are just a brutal repercussion of devotion\nMine are all of the above cuz everything leads to erosion\nNow where I live there's a homeless man, he sits upon a crate\nHe makes a rusty trumpet sound like the music that angels make\nNow if you ever come and visit me, I suggest you watch the show\nTell him Aesop Rock sent ya just to hear his horn blow like this\n\n*Horn samples*\n\n[Aesop Rock]\nAnd I ain't getting any younger\nMy knuckles wear their bruises well\nI've yet to lose that hunger\nBut only time can tell\nProdigal Son with a prodigal wish to sew that prodigal stitch\nAnd crucify bigot voodoo doll on two popsicle sticks\nSee your name is Ambiguity\nMy name is something hands can't hold\nBut hearts part ocean scapes just to watch the starlet unfold\nIt's like sketching a circle in the dirt with a pointed stick\nKnowing the wind'll kill it some day, still it calls my burning wits for now\nAnd if I plow the fields that don't guarantee plentiful harvest\nBut starving artists die, I set my alarm for five o'clock\nIdols block survival crops the cycle stops for nothing\nThe Bible's carp revivalist winos flock by the hundreds\nTo the opening, scarlet carpets greeting their duel\nLeading the stubborn mule to cruel rugburn\nBut y'all numb from gut fuel\nI administer eclipse, there ain't no motor like a martyr-made motor\nCuz a martyr-made motor don't quit\nI am an epiphany, I am webbed foot mammal\nChannel surfing my way to the top\nTugboat in a bottle\nWith no holes poked in the nozzle\nI fed em bedlam diluted in limelight\nTill that rookie boogie graduated hostile\nAnd the vehicle is grandeur and it veered over the median\nThe second my halo ran outta helium\nDemoted to thorn crown, damn talk about numbskull\nI was born bound to a stencil called symmetry\nBut my energy's a rental\nSo I take this now to say\nThank you senorita for holding a flame to a lost wick\nThank you James Anthony for the band-aids on my ego\nY'all are family for life\nI'll take that bullet to preserve you\nI wanna be something spectacular\nOn the day the sun runs outta batteries\nAttach my fashion to the casualties of anarchy\nSave my nickels up to buy that homeless man a brand new horn\nThen sit up on his crate as I witness the beauty born like this\n(I ain't gettin' any younger)\n\n*Horn samples to end*", "title": "Battery", "album": "Labor Days", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6a16cbbd76c264fec96a9675981e9556.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2001-09-18"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
