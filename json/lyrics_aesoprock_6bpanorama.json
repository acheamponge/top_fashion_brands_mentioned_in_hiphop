{"songs": [{"lyrics": "I was sitting on my fire escape and I saw\nSturdy bridges, decorated with dirty pigeons\nA vagabond begging for three pennies and a princess\nA junkie tourniquet surgeon urging the needle in\nA batty senior citizen flashing that awful teethless grin\nI saw a corner store merchant rest on a milk crate with a stog'\nA pierced nose, a model with a stalker, cheap hooker, jay walkers\nA table on a sidewalk with four old men slappin' dominos down\nA city, a village, a neighborhood, a ghost town\nI saw vandals catching tags and Puerto Rican flags\nI saw a pregnant woman on the verge of bursting\nI saw a blind man with a dog screaming someday I'll see it all\nAnd then he sat down with his hammer and saw\nBusiness men with multi-colored ties, cashing their checks\nA Nazi with tattoos on his neck, a Vietnam War vet\nA Caucasian man with a limp and a cane, a pimp with his dames\nA thug circus, a pack of shook tourists hugging their purses\nI saw freaks with rainbow streaks in dayglo hair\nA mother smackin' the grin off her child, replaced it with a stare\nA pothole, a storefront with a broken open sign\nA hole in the wall bar kicking drunks to the gutter, it's closing time\nI see a fuck up, a bum knuckle up with a taxi driver\nA squatter, a grandfather, an angry right-to-lifer\nI can see the roof garden on the apartment across the street\nAnd kick myself because somewhere along the way I lost my seeds\nI see a rat, a roach, a bat approach, a happy student\nA black man with a horn and a will to make you sit and listen to it\nI see a little girl on the corner with bubbles, braids and barrettes\nI see a teen mother with Similac, pacifier, and regrets\nOh, a day turned stale, a hammer with a rusty nail, a failed marriage\nA universe of brick buildings slightly off balance\nA challenge, I see a chance to add real colors to my favorite palette\nRaise my mighty mallet towards the gods and swing my talents\nI see a crack in the sidewalk\nA slide show of sick civilians gripping bottles like idiots\nSitting inside bent meridians\nThere's a fun house ooh, a sun spout\nSpraying yellow beams above yellow back dreams\nAnd children in the hydrants\nHybrids, I see sirens\nThe wall to the glamor standard\nA dead bird, a red curb\nA bus stop where commuters wait to have their souls towed off to work\nI see the slapdash habits of bike messengers pausing\nTo huff that good leaf on the way to damage packages for peddlers\nOh my lord, I see bandwagons, all aboard\nA carnival amusement park where a heart is a luxury\nI see a gas galaxy huddled behind those pearly doors\nMaybe I should sit up on my fire escape a little more", "title": "6B Panorama", "album": "Float", "image": "https://i.genius.com/097177ea52f6ad0147914b68157107a588f47fb2?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mushrecords.com%2Falbum_art_front%2FMH202_D.jpg", "year": "2000-09-05"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
