Be my friend\nDon't believe in God? Well, think again\n\n[Chorus]\nFrailty, touch the demons with your hand\nTo see the skin they're hidin' in\nFrailty, sacrifice to prove your faith\nThis world is sure worth dying in\nFrailty, touch the demons with your hand\nTo see the skin they're hidin' in\nFrailty, sacrifice to prove your faith\nThis world is sure worth dying in\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey are preaching sins all on the TV screen\nCaptions, CC's\u2014all are here to belittle me\nDraw guns, shoot me, that's an option if need be\nLet's draw guns, shoot me, only option I can see\n\n[Chorus]\nFrailty, touch the demons with your hand\nTo see the skin they're hidin' in\nFrailty, sacrifice to prove your faith\nThis world is sure worth dying in\nFrailty, touch the demons with your hand\nTo see the skin they're hidin' in\nFrailty, sacrifice to prove your faith\nThis world is sure worth dying in", "year": "2019-08-04"}], "artist": "ZillaKami"}
