appeals\nHella real, now it\u2019s looking like I\u2019m that dude\nAlways knew I could be that cool\nAnd I ain\u2019t worried 'bout a rap duel\n'Cause nine-tenths of the names in the game digging trash like a mafuckan' racoon\nMade that tape with a gang a hope\nAnd now the hope done changed to know\nAnd now the notes that Dave done wrote\nBeen looking like a bunch of Muthafuckin famous quotes\nAnd nowadays I ain\u2019t phased when they sayin' the jokes\nGet in the way of displaying the flow\nLike ain't nobody rap this way, gonna crack this game\nIt\u2019s a waste if he playin' em both up at the same time\nI ain\u2019t even supposed to be the same guy\nAy you gotta switch the funny with the fake shit\nMake a fake hit, 'bout the money rake and\nGetting babes like a late Zach Morris up in Bayside\nThat\u2019s the only way da shit\u2019ll see the daylight\nI ain\u2019t even gotta humour 'dat\nC'mon bruh, even though I\u2019m pretty new to rap\nThe songs Y'all make stink like tuna cans\nC'mon dog where the real ingenuity at?\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Dicky]\nErrbody wanna act the same\nAnd rap lame crap, tracks get attacked the same\nThat\u2019s why I been up in this muthafucka practicing\n'Cause errybody in the game 'bout to know D\nOld me, not another fake fucking phoney homie\nYou\u2019ll see\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]\nBet a beer that when dicky done\nI\u2019ma make it pretty clear who the gimmick was\nI don\u2019t think I really care who been dissing us\nLemme know when your career as a mimic up\nBetter yet I think I got a deal for you critics that\u2019s been missing\nWhat I\u2019m spitting one contingency, you listen up\n\n[Verse 4: Lil Dicky]\nOne year you gon' say it\u2019s legit\nTwo years you gon' say it\u2019s the shit\nIn three years, if ma name ain't coming up in conversations 'bout the greatest\nIn the game and I ain\u2019t making the list, I\u2019ll suck yo dick\nNow you feelin' a bit homophobic\nLike, \"Ew, what is wrong with him?\nMan, this is why nobody big\u2019ll do a song with him.\"\nAight amigo, we gon' see who got it wrong again\nComprehend what the man said\nBorn to win\nSort of miffed I ain't Jordan yet\nTorched the net\nFor a minute, I admit I am only a beginner\nBut admit in my core I\u2019m a vet\nLil Dicky know the chip up his my shoulder premature as it gets\nHe also pretty sure he the best\n\n[Verse 5: Lil Dicky]\nThat\u2019s why I been up here imploring the bets\nMatter fact I\u2019ll put up more than the head\nI would give up my life for this shit\nYou right, then that\u2019s it\nYa' knife to ma' wrist\nThe night of that dick suck\nWhatchu thought I was here for dat quick buck\nI done gave up my life for this shit\nMy hypothetical wife and them kids\nCouple years when ma' peers have families\nAnd I\u2019m sippin' on a beer being weird as Carrie\nIf you listen closely you can hear the Camrys bump\n\n[Hook: Lil Dicky]\nL-I-L D-I-C\nEvery motherfucka wannabe Ali\nEvery motherfucka  talking like they he\nBut a make-believe can\u2019t make belief\n\n[Verse 6: Lil Dicky]\nLotta rap dudes brag they great\nAnd this and that dude carry the game\nBut a select few rap today\nBeen saying shit like this when it\u2019s carrying weight\nSo who Dave is\nWho Dave is\nAm I just a muthafucka on a playlist\nAm I just another 'sucka being aimless\nAm I just another dummy lacking patience\nTell me now\nI been down for my day ones\nThey were smart enough to fuckin' get it\nThey allowed me to keep going\nNow I\u2019ll be flowing till the whole world fuckin' 'wit it\nOh, you thought I\u2019m here make a name?\nBoi, I\u2019m finna fucking change the game\nAnd if a mafucka' sayin' the same\nI\u2019ll bet brain when you play him, you\u2019ll be saying that he saying the same\nThang, you hearing out of errbody\nWe ain\u2019t fearin' anybody\nBut I\u2019m finished caring bout ya money\nWhatchu wearing out when clubbin'\nWho you staring down, the buddies that been there\nAnd all da honey's you been snaring\nMafuckas love to wear it out\n\n[Verse 7: Lil Dicky]\nIt\u2019s getting easy to compare ya style\nThat\u2019s why they looking so uneasy when they hear about\nA kid who doing something so unique up in the rare crowd\nThey all preparing doubt\nThey unprepared now\nLike this a new approach to the art form\nThis muthafucka bringing jokes to the chart or\nHe doesn\u2019t dumb it down, flow lookin' smarter\nBro, I don't know dis' supposed to be hardcore\nUp in our sport, it\u2019s a hard court\nShit, I\u2019m on the grass straight laughing\nThe young Roger Federer of rapping\nI\u2019m done dodging, this about to happen\nThinkin' back to when Lil Dicky was a tennis captain\nI was second singles, but ma' set of skills average\nFuck I admit it, but I hit it kinda different\nAnd my will is what I win it with it\u2019s only an example\nI am nothing standard\nUsed to be a camper\nYou the fucking close mind\nI\u2019m about to trample\nErrything I flow fire\nYou ain't hold a candle\nBoi, I think it\u2019s showtime\nI am fucking magic\nI ain\u2019t fuckin laughin'\nI am fucking rapping\nThis is what could happen when I am on a track\nAnd I\u2019m feeling like a Jag\nStuck up in some in fucking traffic\nKnowing that the Maybachs could be getting lapped and\nKnowing that the fake rap should be getting fact-checked\nKnowing I could make crap and be getting fat cheques\n\n[Verse 8: Lil Dicky]\nDas' why I never really care for em\nI\u2019m too socially aware for 'em\nLike how the fuck do we prepare for him?\nYou better get another notepad\nFlowin' nuts like I wrote it from my gonads\nI\u2019m tryna tell you muthafuckas I am no fad\nY\u2019all are so bad\nI\u2019m a postgrad\nGetting so mad\nOutta nowhere\nD. it\u2019s only been a half year\nBut you flowin' like you knowing you the last here\nBut you going like ain't no one in ya class here\n\n[Verse 9: Lil Dicky]\nWe ain\u2019t even gonna post his work\nIs he a joke, lemme know when he let go of the quirk\nAnd then I scroll down look at sounds goin' berserk\nBecause the whole fucking blog full of flowless twerps\nTalking 'bout hoes and twerking, shows what\u2019s working\nI ain\u2019t even tryna say I\u2019m perfect\nBut I been putting out songs with purpose\nI been putting out long-ass verses\nAnd now I\u2019m starting to take it awfully personal\nI\u2019m getting sick of seeing Lil Dicky search nulls\nErrbody act like I\u2019m Steve Q Urkel\nLike I ain't Stefan\nLike I ain\u2019t the bomb\nThey treat Dave like I\u2019m Steve Blake\nHomie but the replay saying that I\u2019m straight LeBron\nGot fans on the cowboys\nSports fans get the transition\nBut you know you goin' down boys\nErrbody know I stay chippin'\nAnd you know I\u2019m 'bout to stay different\nEven if they gotta try now\nIt was fun being dumb but you done being numb to the\nOne that's been coming with the highbrow\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m doing when I\u2019m betting dome ya know\nI getcha you outcha' comfort zone\nYou 'bout to question every motherfuckin' thing I\u2019m on\nBut can\u2019t neglect it when America is singing long to dat\n\n[Hook: Lil Dicky]\nL-I-L D-I-C\nEvery motherfucka wannabe Ali\nEvery motherfucka talking like they he\nBut a make-believe can\u2019t make belief"}], "artist": "Lil Dicky"}
