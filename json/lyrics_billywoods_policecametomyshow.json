Let\u2019s get this\nCoffin nailed\u201d\nTop hat and tails tap shoes case I haveta make bail\nThey smirk smilin\u2019 I\u2019m dialed in on an island\nPeeling songs ceiling gone tour muscles strong\nPeople sparse, but they in the palm in the zone\nInside the park and I made it home\nCap tipped to the crowd\nWhoever knew the lyrics\nAnd in that spirit ran back out\nAnd took a bow\n\n[Chorus]\nPolice came to my show tonight\nAnd I did it up\nPolice came to my show tonight\nAnd I did it up\nPolice came to my show tonight\nAnd I did it up\nPolice came to my show tonight\n\n[Verse 2]\nWanted to know if they got they money worth\nBut both slipped out after my last verse\nZero merch sales later I\u2019m at the bar\nSeltzer water omeprazole chaser\nOriginal plan was pay the piper later\nBut as it turns out he bout his paper\nPromoter insisted one for the road\n\u201cThought folks would come out but you never know\u201d\nI replied, \"So it goes\"\nPeace to famous rappers who let me open they shows\nGreen room green tea honey in the teaspoon\nGreen leaf pruned rolled and creased\nFruit and cheese plate I ate all the dates\nBackstage homie like \u201cbro that was great\u201d\nHalf my ages trying to trade cassette tapes\n\n[Chorus]\nPolice came to my show tonight\nAnd I did it up\nPolice came to my show tonight\nAnd I did it up\nPolice came to my show tonight\nAnd I did it up\nPolice came to my show tonight"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
