Her body flyer than a jet pilot\nWhat a smile and the eyes like wet violets\nThey flutter by like the wings of the butterfly\nKeep it tight, Eva Mendes in The Other Guys\nGot me in another zone - they call her Sunshine like\n\"Put your mother on the phone, I ain't comin home\"\nPut a deposit on a place in her heart\nAll along she a place from the start\nMy favela love, man I fell in love, man I fell in love\nMan I fell in love, man I fell in love\nMan I, man I fell in love\nMan I, man I, uh\n\n[Hook: Seu Jorge]\nEhhhh, a gente \u00e9 desse jeito mesmo \u00e9 diferente\nEhhhh, \u00e9 brasileiro \u00e9 swingueiro, \u00e9 cora\u00e7\u00e3o\nEhhhh, a gente \u00e9 que bota f\u00e9 na vida pode cre\nTamo ai para viver para encarar\n(Ehhh) A vida pro que der e vier\n\u00c9 nois que t\u00e1 na fita agora pode cr\u00ea\nBrasil crescendo a gente t\u00e1 ai para aparecer\nSe voce quiser colar com a gente, n\u00e3o tem nada n\u00e3o\nA gente vai correndo junto nessa mesma uni\u00e3o\nBrasil o povo de mistura raca p\u00e9 no ch\u00e3o\nObjectividade na vontade de crescer\n\n[Verse 2]\nA feeling of panic engulfin the whole planet\nYet my words are slow dancin, my language is romantic\nVocabulary that's bustin your capillaries\nMy freedom'll taste sweeter than juices of blacker berries\nMy adversaries speak I'll of my name, I'm so sick\nAttack is very guerilla, my game is so pimp\nEverything fall into place, it's gravitational\nProfit stay in the black, the shade is so un-fadeable\nHealthy relationship make your other ones better\nI'm Lee Scratch Perry, they call me the upsetter\nFor the cheddar get the bread up\nMr. International call it the bruschetta, the spiritual newsletter\nI wish you knew the arc of the story and knew your part\nYou're lookin into my heart or just lookin to be a part\nFrom a boss in my prime, look how we crossin the finish line\nHow you tired, I stay wired like I was offered a line\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nUh, uh\nI don't wanna bang it or beat it, hit it or stab it\nYou're listenin to voodoo, I call it the black magic\nYou jammin up the traffic, you bubble, it don't stop\nIt might blow up but it won't go pop\n\"Pow!\" That's the sound like onomatopoeia\nGot me floatin when you (Rockin My Boat) like you Aaliyah\nGot them African features like people out in Bahia\nMix tobacco with the reefer like you was a European\nWhen I leave I'm gonna miss you, (Official) like Kardinal\nTrust I'll come back and I'll visit for carni-val\nWhen I come back around, take me out on the town\nAnd you can show me how you put it down\nMy favela love, man I fell in love, man I fell in love\nMan I fell in love, man I fell in love\nMan I, man I fell in love\nMan I, yea, yea yea...\n\n[Hook - latter half]"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
