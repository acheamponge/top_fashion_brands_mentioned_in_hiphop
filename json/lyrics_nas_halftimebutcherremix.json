Too much flavor, I'm major\nAtlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number like a pager\nCause I'm an ace when I face the bass\n40-side is the place that is giving me grace\nNow wait, another dose and you might be dead\nAnd I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds\nAnd ain't a damn thing gonna change\nI'mma performer strange, so the mic warmer was born to gain\nNas, why did you do it\nYou know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime\n\n[Hook]\nIt's halftime\nHey yo, it's halftime\nIt's halftime\nCheck it out\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's like that, you know it's like that\nI got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back\nWhen I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back\nSo I react never calmly on a hype track\nI set it off with my own rhyme\nCause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time\nI'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex\nIn your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck\nI used to hustle - now all I do is relax and strive\nWhen I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5\nI drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it\nWith more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach\nNasty Nas has to rise cause I'm wise\nThis is exercise 'til the microphone dies\nBack in '83 I was an MC sparkin'\nBut I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and\nKick my little raps cause I thought nigga wouldn't understand\nAnd now in every jam I'm the fuckin' man\nI rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships\nI used to watch \"CHiPs\", now I load Glock clips\nI got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic\nVersatile, my style switches like a faggot\nBut not bisexual, I'm an intellectual\nOf rap I'm a professional and that's no question, yo\nThese are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?\nCause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man\nAm I in place with the bass and format\nExplore rap and tell me \"Nas ain't all that\"\nAnd next time I rhyme, I be foul\nWhenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild\nI hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme\nStay tuned, Nas soon - the real rap comes at halftime\n\n[Hook]\nIt's halftime\nCheck it, it's halftime\nIt's halftime\nWe're like that\n\n[Verse 3]\nI got it going on, even flip a morning song\nEvery afternoon, I kick half the tune\nAnd in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit\nWord to Marcus Garvey: I hardly sparked it\nCause when I blast the herb, that's my word\nI be slayin' them fast, doing this that and the third\nBut chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay\nI bag bitches up at John Jay, and hit a matinee\nPutting hits on 5-0\nCause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44\nAnd biters can't come near\nAnd yo: \"go to hell\" to the foul cop who shot Garcia\nI won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed\nThat's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed\nThis goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten\nBrooklyn and Queens is living fat and\nThe Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout\nIll Will, rest in peace, yo, I'm out\nBet you I'm out\n\nIt's still halftime\nLittle greens switch through\nYou know it's halftime\nNinety-two\nIt's halftime\nHalftime\nThe police, man\nCome on man get out in here\nYeah"}], "artist": "Nas"}
