Cause I ain't got no time for your kind\nLeave me the fuck alone, I'm heading in a new state of mind\nAnd I'm sick of playing all your games\nYou staining my brain and things will never be the same!\n\nPrimal\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou can't hide long with all of your lies\nAnd when the truth comes out, to stand the test of time\nAnd you can wear your mask and you can hide your face\nYou can destroy your past and you can leave no trace\nSo you can change, trying to rearrange, fuck staying the same\nCause your brain's what I blame for me going insane\nNow let it out and try to survive and keep it real\nThen reveal what you feel with your primal side\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't make hate you for your lies (Don't make me hate you\nI can't relate to, guess I mistaked you, Now I'm gonna hate you)\nI came to grips and realized (I realized, now I realized\nI realized I can see it in your eyes)I can't control my primal side\n(I can't control it, I can't control it\nI can't control it, No, I can't control it!)\n\n[Verse 3]\nIllusions, tattoos, they won't go away\nA constant earthquake or continuous play\nIt's all in my mind, I feel so corrupted\nNow it's time to unwind so I say fuck it!\nFor ADD they're pumping Ritalin in me\nTo help me fit in their society\nBut I won't change, I won't bend, I won't break\nSo take that shit and get the fuck out of my face\nNow!!\n\n[Chorus repeat]\n\nYou can wear your mask, you can hide your face\nYou can destroy your past, you can leave no trace\n\n[Chorus repeat]", "album": "Bi-Polar: Skabz", "image": "https://images.genius.com/59251b7fa08499183d8cba480fbeeb28.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
