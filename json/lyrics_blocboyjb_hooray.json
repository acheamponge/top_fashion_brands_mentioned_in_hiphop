You're mad 'cause your tire still low\nI ain't smoked in three days but my eyes still low\nIf a nigga broke, no convo\nPut your bitch up on 'Woods and I tell her I need the shit pronto\nI'm the sugar honey iced tea, lookin' for a bitch like CoCo\nPut your bitch in the water, now you playin' Finding Nemo\nFresh as fuck in this Valentino\n\n[Chorus]\nShawty said she wanna fuck me but it's too late\nBut she ain't fuck with me when I had the shoes with no shoelace\nFly a bitch up out of Dallas just to mix my Texas Kool-Aid\nThen I get up in her mouth until that bitch get her a toothache\nGucci on my shoelace, trappin', servin' two days\nTryna figure out which nigga bitch I'm gon' fuck today\nBitch, I'm the man, hooray, got plenty bands, hooray\nBitch, my life is a movie and you the camera man, Bluray"}], "artist": "BlocBoy JB"}
