Pick up the phone, man. I know they got you running around, bro. Anyway, it\u2019s all good with Socrates hooking you up, dawg. Hey, best wishes for this tape. I hope you take over the world. You know we gon' do it. You make sure you get me on there. You call me when you need that hook, you call me when you need that beat, you call me when you need that [hot 16], bro, and let\u2019s put this whole mathematics together, dawg. Once again, it\u2019s a whole gang from Room for Improvement, so we about to be taking over this year, right? Riiight\n\n[Message 2]\nYo, Drake. What up? This is Keeyaga, your boy here. Umm, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re not picking up the phone, you\u2019re probably out, you know, talking to Lindsay Lohan, or will be talking to her eventually. But, yo, check it out, it\u2019s your boy Keeyaga. I\u2019m just calling to say what up, haven\u2019t talked to you in forever, indefinitely. You know, we need to go, you know, downtown Toronto, kick it together and do what we gotta do, but, uh, I gotta, you know, get off the phone because I have, you know, Beyonc\u00e9, you know, even Mendes all on the other line. So, yo, do what you gotta do, and holla at your boy man. All the best. Peace"}]}
