Would he be proud?\nIt ain't about the choices that you shouldn't've made\nIt's about what you did when they couldn't been made\nSee I'm dancin' with the devil, one foot in the grave\nThe eyes are windows to your soul, take a look at my pain\nIt's all about the risks that you lookin' to take\nAnd fuck what anybody says, yo, it's good to be brave\nFocus on the positives, don't look at mistakes\nI shoulda been a failure if you look at my grades, ayy\nFeel that inner zen, in a sense\nInnocence is just a lack of inner sense, mmm\nI don't rate success in the numbers I am paid\nI rate it from people just tellin' me their lives were saved\nWasn't the person the media would try to paint\nHaters read the headlines, fans read the entire page\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\"God as my witness\nI'll be damned if I'ma pray for forgiveness\"\n'Cause fuck it, I'm the same as you\nThe same demons I am facin' too\n\n[Chorus (Extended)]\nSame God, same boy\nSame whispers in my ear\nFuck it, I'm the same as you\nThe same demons I am facin' too\nSame God, same boy\nSame whispers in my ear\nFuck it, I'm the same as you\nThe same demons I am facin' too\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo\nThere's a monster growin' in me, and I have to feed it\nThe last one to go, the others though I have defeated\nI'm self-destructive, perhaps I need it\nI know deep down I gotta do everything that I can do beat it\nI don't have the key, it's locked away deep inside\nMy chest in a place I hate goin' so I have to leave it\nI don't know if I ever can gather the strength\nTo grab it and face up to it and get my hand to reach it\nEvery time I just lose my fuckin' mind\nWhilst it stands over me again and again and I'm trapped beneath it\nSo maybe I never can and that's the reason\nI portray this image of a better man when I haven't been him\nIt goes back to when I was a child\nLife is meant to be all smiles\nInstead it took away my innocence, where everything in life\nBecame negative and ever since it I keep tellin' 'em\n\"As God as my witness\"\n\n[Chorus]\nSame God, same boy\nSame whispers in my ear\nFuck it, I'm the same as you\nThe same demons I am facin' too\nSame God, same boy\nSame whispers in my ear\nFuck it, I'm the same as you\nThe same demons I am facin' too"}]}
