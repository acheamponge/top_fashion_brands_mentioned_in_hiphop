{"songs": [{"lyrics": "Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4\nJockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes\nWent to the park to get the scoop\nKnuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops\nA car pulls up, who can it be?\nA fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G\nHe rolls down his window and he started to say\nIt's all about makin' that GTA\n'Coz the boyz-n-the-hood are always hard\nYou come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card\nKnowin' nothin' in life but to be legit\nDon't quote me, boy 'coz I ain't sayin' shit\n[Beats]\nDonald B in the place to give me the pace\nHe said, My man JD is on freebase\nThe boy JD was a friend of mine\n'Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine\nChased him up the street to call a truce\nThe silly cluck head pulls out a deuce-deuce\nLittle did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge\nOne sucker dead, L.A. Times, front page\n'Coz the boyz-n-the-hood are always hard\nYou come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card\nKnowin' nothin' in life but to be legit\nDon't quote me, boy 'coz I ain't sayin' shit\nBored as hell and I wanna get ill\nSo I went to a place where my homeboys chill\nThe fellows out there, makin' that dollar\nI pulled up in my 6-4 Impala\nThey greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin'\nAnd from the 8-ball, my breath start stinkin'\nLove to get my girl, to rock that body\nBefore I left, I hit the Bacardi\nWent to her house to get her out of the pad\nDumb h*** says somethin' that made me mad\nShe said somethin' that I couldn't believe\nSo I grabbed the stupid *** by her nappy ass weave\nShe started talkin *** wouldn't you know?\nReached back like a pimp and slapped the h***\nHer father jumped out and he started to shout\nSo I threw a right-cross, cold knocked him out\n'Coz the boyz-n-the-hood are always hard\nYou come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card\nKnowin' nothin' in life but to be legit\nDon't quote me, boy 'coz I ain't sayin' ***\nI'm rollin' hard now, I'm under control\nThen wrapped my 6-4 'round the telephone poll\nI looked at my car and I said, \"Oh brother\nI throw it in the gutter and go buy another\nWalkin' home, I see the G ride\nNow Kat is drivin', Kilo on the side\nAs they busted a u, they got pulled over\nAn undercover cop in a dark green Nova\nKat got beaten for resistin' arrest\nHe socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess\nNow G is caught for doin' the crime\nFourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time\n'Coz the boyz-n-the-hood are always hard\nYou come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card\nKnowin' nothin' in life but to be legit\nDon't quote me, boy 'coz I ain't sayin' ***\nI went to get them out but there was no bail\nThe fellaz start to riot in the County Jail\nTwo days later in Municipal Court\nKilo G on trial, cold cut a fart\nDisruption of a court said the judge\nOn a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge\nBailiff came over to turn him in\nKilo G looked up and gave a grin\nHe yelled out fire, then came Suzy\nThe *** came in with a sub-machine Uzi\nPolice shot the girl but didn't hurt her\nBoth up state for attempted murder\n'Coz the boyz-n-the-hood are always hard\nYou come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card\nKnowin' nothin' in life but to be legit\nDon't quote me, boy 'coz I ain't sayin' ***", "album": null, "year": null, "title": "Boyz-N-The-Hood (remix)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/627acab300f5f3fd378a3b1adf4a69f8.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "N.W.A"}
