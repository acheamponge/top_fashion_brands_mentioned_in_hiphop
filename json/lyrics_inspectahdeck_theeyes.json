Still a story is told\nWhere there's hate for the hero\nAnd the villains are god\n'till fate revealed his card\nHes still feelin' it hard\nNow i don't believe in magic ,witchcraft or voodoo\nJust karma, the things you do come back to you\nThird eye wide survive\nTry to stay alive\nMake a way\nJust to say\nYou lived before you died\nLook ahead with faith,not back with regrets\nBlessed,safe travels on your path to success\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nYou gotta have love for yourself\nBefore you love something else\nThe feeling itself\nCould be harmful to health\nTrust is a luxury\nEarned by respect and loyalty\nThe honor make it to next to royalty\nSome stand in the sun their skin begin peeling\nBlind to the truth\nBattling with inner demons\nPoison in the brain\nSure they going insane\nMaintain through the joy and the pain\nIts like all we know\nBless the children before we go\nLove is love, that's at least how the story go\n\n[Production by Bronze Nazareth]", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/1eb28d7266360fbb461ad268a24389ae.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "Cynthia\u2019s Son", "year": "2014-11-17"}]}
