(What\u2019d you say?).  I\u2019m the old joke\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nI\u2019m the old joke.  Became rich because I was so broke\nWatched the young seeds turn into old folk\nI died almost, but we all came so close\nNow laugh at the old joke\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nI used to rock windbreakers\u2014now it\u2019s fat leathers\nI got money now (So?)\u2014I\u2019m still a ass-bettor\nEverything I wanted, I stole like a lowlife\nRocked crowds of ten-thousand with no mic\nI don\u2019t live in the project.  No writ, no lights\nSo don\u2019t step on that cigarette, aight?\nThe old joke.  Warm toast\u2014the gat\u2019s in the couch\nCrib so small, you walk in and fall back out\nLike wack MCs, always wanna be nice\nDumb like going to the sixth floor pressing three twice\nKnock your patch off\u2014my rap like Lee\u2019s and get your teeth cracked\nBelieve me, Mikey wouldn\u2019t even eat that\nAin\u2019t your momma gritty?  Who pops corns with 9 millies?\nMighty fine, [?] snuff, break his time\nI\u2019ll choke you and ask, \u201cDid I do that?\u201d like Urkel\nWith three legs, walking in a circle\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nI\u2019m the old joke.  Became rich because I was so broke\nWatched the young seeds turn into old folk\nI died almost, but we all came so close\nNow laugh at the old joke\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nTwelve eggs at a tennis match playing the dozens\nYou ain\u2019t hard-boiled\u2014your weak shell could be crushed in\n(And we dissed you).  \u201cEverybody\u2019s tough now.\u201d  Look into this dumb fact\nA fun snack will lead to a gun clap\nWhile I get love like Barney, my haze is purple\nYour moms is my dog\u2014I Walker like Herschel\nYou see, son, when the quarter back was a refund\nEveryone bit moves from Rerun\nHot peas in butter.  Police seize motherfuckers in covers\nBut I\u2019m hip to the game like the ruckus, suckers\nMy pops is a old man with a wooden leg and a kickstand\n(Laugh) Laugh\u2014that\u2019s that shit, fams\nRappers had the gall, but that\u2019s not all\nI\u2019ll make a shoot a dead rocket, play casketball\n(Yo, speak English!).  My words is a math test\nAnd your chick sticks ice in the drawers to keep the crabs fresh\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nI\u2019m the old joke.  Became rich because I was so broke\nWatched the young seeds turn into old folk\nI died almost, but we all came so close\nNow laugh at the old joke\n\n[Bridge: C-Rayz Walz with DJ JS-1 Scratches]\nI\u2019m the old joke\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nTimeless definers wisest, livest\nMine of highness to realize an idea of brightness\nAnd react with the impact of life\u2019s excitement\nTo make you laugh while I\u2019m seriously frightened\nTaking time to show respect to punchlines\nThe lunchroom tables, the blocks at summertime\nBrothers cried.  Some got punched in the eye\nSome was like \u201cFuck that.  You got it,\u201d and paid it no mind\nBack in days, kids that can\u2019t snap\nThey probably the same motherfuckers on stage now that can\u2019t rap\nAnd I can\u2019t like it\u2019s OK \u2018cause it\u2019s not\nTrue school like \u201cMe and you, three o\u2019clock.\u201d  Watch!\nAll you could front, smoke, or pop 9 shots\nUsed to hump joke and climb rocks\nSo I stopped to gaze at a page of forgotten days\nLast one to cop my album is a fried, rotten egg\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nI\u2019m the old joke.  Became rich because I was so broke\nWatched the young seeds turn into old folk\nI died almost, but we all came so close\nNow laugh at the old joke\n\n[Bridge: C-Rayz Walz with DJ JS-1 Scratches]\nI\u2019m the old joke\n\n[Outro: C-Rayz Walz]\nProbably got a sling durag.  Hahaha.  Corduroy bra.  Laugh at that"}]}
