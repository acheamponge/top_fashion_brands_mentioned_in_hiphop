I got advice for ya holmes\nFall asleep in your car in your garage with the engine on\nI'm playing ping pong with your bitch' jaws\nYou the type to have a sing-along in Superman drawers\nI got a redhead ho, I call her Molly Ringwald\nShe like to take a lot of Molly and bring Adderall\nSipping white wine till the sunset\nBefore it got dark she already got naked\nNecked her for a second, then she got reckless\nRump shaker, wrecks and FX'd it\nBum, stickity bum, stickity bum, Das EFX'ed it\nLeft her bum sticky, fell asleep on the terrace\nMe on the beat, that's a hate crime\nWith black ink, I murder white lines (Baseline)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhat's with all the ho shit?\nYour flow's atrocious, the amount of weed I smoke is copious\nEyes red like Soviet, dog, you're on some bogus shit\nThese novice poets are not my associates\nFerocious, but the flows inappropriate\nBut if you approach this they might call encroachment\nI'm so bent, oh shit, got your bitch soaking\nI ain't Clarence Carter but, bitch, I be stroking\nHo, are you outta your mind?\nI tell a bitch like this, \"You are not that fine\"\nI don't give a bitch shit, no, not a dime\nBut bitch, for you, I ain't even got time\nThe sunshine in the thunder storm\nCatching clouds smelling like the green giant underarm\nI can never cop her holmes, I just give her Sutter Homes\nNut all on her butt, wipe it up, then I send her home (Baseline)", "year": "2011-08-15"}], "artist": "Danny Brown"}
