I'm Baby Jesus, these niggas make believe, I make believers\nBut how many said that shit when I was John?\nShe tell me she fuck with me 'cause of my grind\nBeen grinding forever, I told her stop lying\nI told her she fuck with me 'cause of my shine\nIt don't even matter, shit, how can I blame ya\nI am a god with the gun and the weapon\nShall prosper, I'm walking with heavenly angels\nI have just noticed my calling was super, your prophet\nDisguised as an artist to put on for Charlotte\nYou already know it, nobody can flow it\nNiggas around me, all of 'em grew up with me\nSome of them niggas, they didn't grow up with me\nBut I bet they wish they did, and nobody fuck with me\nYou already know it, we calling 'em coming\nYou already know it, free all of my cousins\nYou already know it, nigga, Baby Jesus", "album": "So Disrespectful", "year": "2015-09-25", "title": "One Time", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5fff303436ce317346b2deeb6b74d79e.910x910x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DaBaby"}
