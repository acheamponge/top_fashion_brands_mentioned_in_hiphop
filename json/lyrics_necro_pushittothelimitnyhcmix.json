For the right price somebody'll dead you\nNo cushion for lyrics, mushin' you if you're timid\nExtreme rap, explicit, we push it to the limit\n\n(Chorus)\n(Necro)\nYou tremble from the brutality\nMake you resemble George A. Romero character in reality\nBring your big posse\nYou'll be a bunch of fertilized faggots, like Versace and Liberace\nGet killed in a building, smashing you like Zildjian\nCymbals, buckin' you like Brazilian children\nWrite your will out to your attorney\nAfter a weekend at Bernie's you'll be deceased, dead on a gurney\nI rip the beat like the contours of your flesh stripped\nAs you stare, pump gore, it's a trip\nCan't think about food with bullets buried in your belly\nBut notice bloody flesh looks like blueberry jelly\nYou're repulsively corrosive\nYour mother taught you not to get involved with explosives\nSkull opened like Iron Maiden Eddy, kaput, finished\nWanted excitement, you died for it, you pushed it to the limit\n\n(Chorus)\n(Necro)\nWe'll push it to the limit like a tourniquet crushin' your cranium\nMushin' you, murder you, burnin' you to a crisp live on uranium\nMaintainin' sins like Iranians holdin' grenade pins\nBlazin' your skin, stomp you with a whole parade of Timbs\nPut a gemstar to your flesh pa, the emperor\nOf demented sentences with a temper, your mentor\nDemonic like Skeletor, Destro, 'Deceps'\nCriminal corrupted culprits'll beat you to death\nKeep your head up or you'll get your head cut off\nYour whole life shut off with a knife, wipe the blood off\nMy perspective is respect this or expect\nTo be left With a neck full of stitched up imperfections\n'Cause you bitched up, in retrospective your collective\nWoulda switched up if you knew what a bunch of sick fucks\nWe are when we get hectic too late, drama, we all up in it\nGo all out, push it to the limit"}], "artist": "Necro"}
