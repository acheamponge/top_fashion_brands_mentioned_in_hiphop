huh\n(CashFlow on the beat)\nYea, lawd!\nUh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh uh huh\nYea, look\n\n[Hook]\nI got a whole lotta stress I needa get off of my chest\nI put my pain inside the lyrics of my songs\nPeople tellin' me to slow it down or change it up\nOr make it more repetitive so everybody else can sing along\nSo quick to tell a mothafucka what to do\nBut you ain't ever done it\nYou ain't even got a plan to show a nigga how to run it\nYour opinion null and void\nI need a blessing from the lord\nI'll be the sacrifice repenting for us all\n\nGoddammit I'm appalled\nAppalled you would ever try to compare me to one of these niggas not at all\nGoddammit I'm appalled\nAppalled you would ever think that I would ever follow in the footsteps of these frauds\nGoddammit I'm appalled\nAppalled people buyin' into ignorance as if they couldn't see it's a facade\nBoy you better tell 'em all\nSecond comin' resurrection of the real, a pussy nigga better bow to the God\nGoddammit I'm appalled\n\n[Verse 1]\nJust give me a minute, I know you feel it\nDepicted a composition exquisitely how I kill it\nDismissin' the opposition disintegrated they purpose\nMy dissertation of verses I've written in 3rd person\nWithin the times that we live in it's easy to form opinions\nAssumin' they're not pursuin' the vision of dissolution\nWhat you view is my reality or my current predicament\nI'm livin' like a realist my future is far from limitless\nBut hold up, now don't nobody do the shit that you do\nYou comin' with the flow and you gotta know it's unusual\nAmusin' when you murder the beat in dirty attire\nThey circle and form a cypher for stories like campfires\nMy desire is to be dope, c'mon homie we know\nProphetic not pathetic, you feel this in your libido\nBut goddamn nigga that's a shot below the belt\nAnd my knuckle will break the buckle\nYour self-esteem start to crumble\nAccompanied by your pride\nNow divide by your inequities\nImma call it incompetence, agree to disagree\nI'm indifferent towards a compliment\nConsequence of my confidence\nGivin' you my disdain and my pain, I paint it with potency\nPlus a picture of poverty\nPenetrate with pathology\nMy policy is honesty\nI gotta make it evident\nA sacrificial vision\nRepent and makin' it prevalent\nRepressin' memories of my misery with a sedative\n\n[Hook]\nI got a whole lotta stress I needa get off of my chest\nI put my pain inside the lyrics of my songs\nPeople tellin' me to slow it down or change it up\nOr make it more repetitive so everybody else can sing along\nSo quick to tell a mothafucka what to do\nBut you ain't ever done it\nYou ain't even got a plan to show a nigga how to run it\nYour opinion null and void\nI need a blessing from the lord\nI'll be the sacrifice repenting for us all\n\nGoddammit I'm appalled\nAppalled you would ever try to compare me to one of these niggas not at all\nGoddammit I'm appalled\nAppalled you would ever think that I would ever follow in the footsteps of these frauds\nGoddammit I'm appalled\nAppalled people buyin' into ignorance as if they couldn't see it's a facade\nBoy you better tell 'em all\nSecond comin' resurrection of the real, pussy niggas better bow to the God\nGoddammit I'm appalled\n\n[Verse 2]\nPeter paid the Piper with plenty of pennies\nDependin' upon the pity of people is problematic\nA savage I've been sedated I'm saving all of my energy\nEmbedded existentially. a phenomenal entity\nI'm feelin' like a phenom, lyrics for you to feed off\nI'm barely standing on my own I'm not someone to lean on\nMy generation lost so I'm writing for predecessors\nImpressive as they assess that you should play this for your fetus\nThese niggas send repetitive sentences through your speakers\nI see this shit as egregious and actually facetious\nBut if I keep at this pace and the page is emaciated\nThe pain is alleviated the story abbreviated\nI could try to break it down maybe go a little slower\nWhy tell 'em when I can show 'em\nAs I display my devotion\nI'm divi-ing up my time as I'm tappin' into your temperament\nYou compliant with hatred complacent within your head\nIt takes an Ill-er type of a nigga, make you reconsider\nFuck what you deliver, call me Jack the Ripper, body in the river\nI can make 'em all believe me, ain't it easy, up the ante\nI'm hopin' you understand me, I'm plannin' to be a legend\nMy lyrics are indirect as I'm interceptin' your ignorance\nGlorious nigga isn't it, I've been tired of your fidgetin'\nAffix your fascination an actual castration\nI make a lasting impression that you can never erease\n\n[Hook]\nI got a whole lotta stress I needa get off of my chest\nI put my pain inside the lyrics of my songs\nPeople tellin' me to slow it down or change it up\nOr make it more repetitive so everybody else can sing along\nSo quick to tell a mothafucka what to do\nBut you ain't ever done it\nYou ain't even got a plan to show a nigga how to run it\nYour opinion null and void\nI need a blessing from the lord\nI'll be the sacrifice repenting for us all\n\nGoddammit I'm appalled\nAppalled you would ever try to compare me to one of these niggas not at all\nGoddammit I'm appalled\nAppalled you would ever think that I would ever follow in the footsteps of these frauds\nGoddammit I'm appalled\nAppalled people buyin' into ignorance as if they couldn't see it's a facade\nBoy you better tell 'em all\nSecond comin' resurrection of the real, pussy niggas better bow to the God\nGoddammit I'm appalled"}], "artist":
