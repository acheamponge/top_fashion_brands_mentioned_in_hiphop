I'm leaving\nAdios, vamonos\nI fuck your mama, word to mama, keep your mama close\n\n[Hook: Juelz Santana]\nUh, I know you miss this\nIt's still Dipset, you dipshits\nStay fly, don't get your bitch hit\nStay gripped, don't get your shit split\nUh, still push it and get it off\nNigga, we just cut from a different cloth\nUh, I know you miss this\nStill Dipset, you dipshits\n\n[Verse Two: Cam'ron]\nMan, fuck a magazine, don't care what you cowards read\nDon't gotta wonder, we like wonder with our bread\nMoney, respect, don't forget the power, dread\nHad this one girl squirting like a showerhead\nNine on the waist, eighty keys in the trunk\nStamp on the dope, eighty degrees of funk\nReebok money, eighty degrees in the pumps\nLookin' for me? Top floor suite of the Trump, baby\nCause of stupidity, send fire, humidity\nNo one here is sick of me, got the gift, no Christmas tree\nGet the shovels, y'all, everyone digging me\nI'm back to the future, still making history\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Dame Dash]\nI feel like rapping on this shit\nFirst off, my name is Dame Dash\nAnd I want to talk for a second if you don't mind, let me just say one thing:\nI am from Harlem, and I'm back outside\nAnd you know what that means?\nThat means people eat. Cause I'm a Harlem nigga, and that's what we do\nThat means when we walk in the room, nobody's safe\nYou 'bout to feel that, pause\nHarlem sticks together\nSo if you feeling like number one, get ready to be number two, cause we back\nWhat's that shit y'all be saying?\nFool's Gold!\nAight? 'Bout to party, I might pop bottles\nMight have to see Champagne Dame!"}]}
