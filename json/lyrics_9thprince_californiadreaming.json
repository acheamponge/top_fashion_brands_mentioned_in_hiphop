Two pulls and pass\nSmoking that sticky looking pretty like Ricky\nMake a good kiss left a hicky\nShout out to my West Coast killer bees\nWe got the cure for rap disease\nSo nigga please bitch on your knees\nCalifornia dreaming in my fatigues", "year": "2014-05-05", "title": "California Dreaming", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/ccbdd6cb158ad4b2a20375a204be67b5.170x170x1.jpg"}]}
