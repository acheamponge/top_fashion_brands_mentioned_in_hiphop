Right?\nI fell in traps on the pilgrimage sellin' off to dodge when you left me for a bargain\n\nSometimes I drink till four AM\nAm I self-destructive? I drink therefore I am\nMagnetism like I know Descartes\nOn a sojourn for an owner of a lonely heart\nWe could be together, forever\nOn Noah's ark drifting where the souls depart\nYou could show me the contents\nNapoleon complex could rip my bones apart\nLook\nI would bleed in the snow\nAnd wait for the sun just to see what would grow\nThis is for the days I would sink in a hole and every disconnected handshake received at a show\nFor every single girl that was scared to say she loved me\nAnd everyone that did when she'd only want to fuck me\nFor every friend that I knew I'd never trust\nAll's quiet on the western front\nI've been searching for a straw in a barrel full of needles\nToo late to be original but scared to do a sequel\nWhen the veins show they're varicose and feeble\nFrom the fake hopes and pheromones they feed you\nSee, I don't like my skin today I'll bite the hand that feeds till it bleeds and my lips decay\nAll these things I can't give away\nSo I think I'll just sit awake\n\n(What's the point of dreaming anyway right?)\n\nThere's a monster on the inside clawin' at my skin\nBeggin' me to let him out and calling me a friend\nTelling me to have some fun, telling me to grab a gun\nSaying it'll be a blast I know that he's acting up\nBut, if he doesn't quit soon I'mma have to send him to his bedroom (Click, Boom)\nYou are nothing but another schizophrenic urge of givin' human properties without a sympathetic nervous system\nUh, I hope you get under control cause\nI don't wanna get to know the devil on my shoulder\nRainbows are black\nAngels are black\nFangs in my neck and your halo is cracked\nAllergic to your skin so you make jokes and laugh\nBut you really want to leave I'm your scapegoat for that\nAnd even though I know I'm barely turning twenty five\nWhen there's no more bridges left I'll just burn myself alive\nThat's what I deserve\nThat's what I have earned\nWhen I can't survive the ash and fire, blasphemize my words\nTell them that I wasn't very good in the first place\nDon't believe the hype wake me up when it's October", "album": null}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
