You better stop the shenanigans, shit ain't good for ya health\nKeep that heavy duty Gucci, the 30 clip is heavy\nGot a gold and silver 40, same color as the bezel\n\n[Hook]\nNever would I Snitch, no, never would I tell\nAnd never wife a bitch, my soul I never sell\n600 are them goons, we givin' niggas hell\nYou can wife her better not kiss her\nAnd never fight, I throw shells\nNever would I snitch, no, never would I tell\nAnd never wife a bitch, my soul I never sell\nAnd everybody trappers but never sold a brick\nHe a driller, he a hitter, but ain't never did a hit"}]}
