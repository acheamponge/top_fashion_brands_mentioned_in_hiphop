It's a new day!\nCot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!\nHooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu!\nCot' damn!\n\n[Verse 1: Malice]\nUh, they just can't understand or fathom my demeanor\nUnapproachable appearance to how I pack the ninas\nOut of two, Clipse they say Malice the meanest\nGot love for guns and caine, let nothin' come between us\nYou mistook me for a rapper, huh\nWell that makes me an actor, cause I would rather clap a gun\nAnd buck on them niggas who hate\nWho wanna be in my shoes, live my life, but can't carry my weight\nI understand that the envy is part of the game\nBut make no mistake, you and I, we are not the same\nNaw, bitch, I'm liable to splatter ya shit\nLight up ya world, 'til you start to stagger and shit\nWatch how them hollows straight rattle ya shit\nAnd I leave it to y'all, to freestyle and battle and shit\nThat's not me, I'm more at home wit the chrome\nOr at play wit the yay, moving 12 for a zone, I'm gone\n\n[Hook: Pharrell]\nCot' damn! It's a new day!\nCot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!\nHooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu!\nCot' damn!\n\n[Verse 2: Ab-Liva]\nGod damn, when that white hits the pan and\nComes back hard, I can account for every gram and\nThe streets molded the man I am\nThe pimp, the hustler, the crook, the killer, go-rilla\nTraits of a blow dealer, cost my fame\nI hustle, I'm rich, blow scrilla\nI'm the torch that, carry the game\nThe flame I throw, crack change came from blow\nPush the O's, six lay close\nHug the streets, I hug the beat, change flows\nThug the streets, my love is deep, my pain shows\nMy hearts on a sleeve-a\nNigga that they gave they soul and hearts to mistreat you\nNigga told, they breaking my heart on the streets so\nWatch the phonies, watch ya homies\nWe pop-pop, DROP you homey\n\n[Hook: Pharrell]\nCot' damn! It's a new day!\nCot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!\nHooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu!\nCot' damn!\n\n[Verse 3: Pusha T]\nThey call me Pusha for one reason\nCause I keep that sniff all seasons\nWhether the price is up or down\nI keep a mound to pitch from, you don't have to shop around\nWhen it come to that money, I get stealth\nThree guns is fortune, and I don't mind sharing my wealth\nDog, I know about life\nI been around the world thrice times, I mean what I say\nFrom that Panama sun, to France's Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\nGrind so deep-rooted, I can't turn away\nTo sell base is now somewhat therapeutic\nHear what I say, please don't confuse it\nMy verses heal, like Curt Mayfield's music\n(I'm your pusha!), damn right\nI treat ya nose to hook ya\nAnd only pull back to cook ya, partner\n\n[Hook: Pharrell]\nCot' damn! It's a new day!\nCot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!\nHooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu!\nCot' damn!\n\n[Verse 4: Roscoe P. Coldchain]\nI be damned if I die of starvation, things is fucked up as is\nSo I bangs my cabbage; do you not know the most effective\nWay of gettin' money, pull yo gun - rapidly\nAnd watch you see the situation be corrected\nLord Heavens, why must I live so devilish\nThey say whatcha do comes back on you two times\nI shoulda been died, but I'm still walking around wit two nines\nWho wants to be a millionaire, me, and you ain't got no more life lines\nYou a snitch nigga fighting crime, go ahead and tell the police\nCause every move you make, I'mma throw a slug\nAnd hope you choke blood, nigga, on every breath you take\nNot to be broke, cause Coldchain fate witness\nNaturally spitting from me, human gat, field to the limit\nHead to diminish, loud niggas talking gibberish\nGrind beef, I deliver it, with complimentary service, for certain\nLive in the living room, searching to hurting you\n\n[Hook: Pharrell]\nCot' damn! It's a new day!\nCot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!\nHooooouuuuuu! Hooooouuuuuu!
