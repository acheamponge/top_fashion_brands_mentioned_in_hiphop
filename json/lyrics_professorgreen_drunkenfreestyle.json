That's kinda easy\nFor starters, he rhymes dead\nOn the mic, his rhymes are all dead\nHe looks like he's growing a fetus inside his forehead\nI'm the sickest to prove that I'm the sickest at this\nWhen he was born he split his mother in two\nCause his head was so big, the flow is so sick\nEverybody knows Pro is no prick\nAnd I ain't legit, and you rappers are all fags\nI still got skunk right by my ball bags\nEven though I'm on dial, that's a dangerous statement\nEverybody understands and knows what I'm saying is real\nI'm the realest one to spit this tight\nEverybody knows I rip this tonight\nThey'll probably rip this and put this on internet websites\nI'll wreck tight, everybody knows when I get mics\nI don't stop you have to tell me to slow down\n\n[DJ Semtex: \"Talk about Mike Skinner and The Streets\"]\n\nMike Skinner and The Streets, they're a dangerous influence\nDrugs? Before them I wasn't into them\nI'm blinded by lights like Mike is\nBefore I drop three of them speckly white things\nHe makes my eyes look like ten pence pieces\nWhen he gives me pills - I'm joking I shouldn't say this\nYou're all laughing and making it hard to spit, but drugs are hard to quit\nEspecially when you've been smoking since the age of 13\nEverybody knows me from a yout, I burned weed\nThat's how I got the name\nI'm in this game cause I can do it - it's easy\nTo me it's like fluid\nFlowing through my veins that's how consistent it is\nEverybody knows I rip when I spit\nI'm the sickest shit\nYo, I'm not funny, I spit hot shit like my arse does after a curry\nI'm the illest in here\nEverybody knows I ain't no queer\nBut some people say I'm gay, some say I'm a racist\nI say they should shut they mouth and not say shit\nI just spray this, the illest with a flow\nYou don't know me, I'm still the illest that you know\n\n[Radio DJ: Yo talk about the Jump Off How you won the battles consistently, 7 weeks, like 10 weeks, whatever it was]\n\n\nYo, I got the sickest of flows\nAin't nobody else ever won seven weeks in a row\nYo, you know that I'm nice, I won seven weeks in a row\nI took the piss cause I did it twice\nAll these other MC's be rapping my name\nI'm like \"I ain't listening blud, their rapping is lame\"\nThey ain't nothing to me, ain't nothing to P\nI'm like relaxed, at home and puffing the trees\nBelieve I won, I was laughing\nKicking back in the bohemian sun\nWhat I paid to go to-\nOh wait, I mean I didn't pay to go there\nI got paid to go there\nIts like no fair, I'm killing it\nEveryone knows-", "year": null}]}
