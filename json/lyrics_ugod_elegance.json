Shit's crazy\nThis is classic New York with a fork\nYou eat it up 'till this shit is no more\n\n[Chorus: Nomadiq]\nCan we catch the L-train to an island\nI hop out that foreign\nIt's yours baby you know it\nI said girl you know it\nManhattan to Shaolin\nDraped down in diamonds\nGet love everywhere I walk, it's the way I talk\nAnd this jet only lands in New York\n\n[Verse 2: U-God]\nCan I get a soul clap, what you know about that\nI'm master of the ceremony, hit me on the amp\nYou only got calm when I pulled the Dom\nAnd your friends looking cute they can all come\nIt's like dinner in the park, after dark\nWatching really deep talk, Star Wars\nStatic on your dress game, your spark\nThen pull out a pen, write a bar or two\nCabin on the greens, Central Park with a barbecue\nHorse drawn carriage, and I'm looking for the marriage\nJust a Staten Island nigga holding more than the average\nDelancey Street, three quarters to my feet and I never got beat\nAnd it was radio, suckers never play me\nOkay but that shit stay, still shakes the ladies\nIt was classic New York with a fork to eat it up\nCan you give us some more?\n\nCan we catch the L-train to an island\nI hop out that foreign\nIt's yours baby you know it\nI said girl you know it\nManhattan to Shaolin\nDraped down in diamonds\nGet love everywhere I walk, it's the way I talk\nAnd this jet only lands in New York\n\n[Samples]\nAnd you say New York City\nIs like that y'all\nAnd you say New York City\nIs like that y'all\nHold it down for New York city", "title": "Elegance", "year": "2018-03-30", "album": "Venom"}], "artist": "U-God"}
