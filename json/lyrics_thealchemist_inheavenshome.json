Is mind boggling, I'm extremely good with rap, they know what time it is\nHalf past 187; 9/11 it's too late, the food I ate? They need reverends, body of Christ\nFace of a playboy, throw me to the hoes; I show love with great voice\nDSL mouth, she's a bad bitch, I'd take her to the house, sex & hardcore rapper; new vice\nShe hang around me too much; I'll breathe life, where there's lack there of\nAll the shoot outs & drama, it excites her\n\n[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]\n\nFace the mirror, taste the syrup; spray gear up and relocate to Europe\nMe? I await the spirit, my wound's favored; can't heal it, my game loose they can't hem it\nRalph Lauren linen Lauren London, Flooring Lambs' down on Linden; let a nigga flourish\nLord forgive me for my sins; drive BM's, condominiums is 3M's Tres bien\nThe B.M. sucked the D.M. by 8pm, I beat the pussy like I'm fresh outta the P-E-N\nThe G-E-M on the team I'm like the G.M. you see him, trips to the Caribbean\nI'm peeing on your well-being, load the van; 10 bricks from Medellin\nThat's enough snow to go skiing, I'm O.D.'n...it's no B.S\n\n\n[Outro]\n\nPraise to the Lord, the King of King's\nHe has risen, he has risen", "title": "In Heaven\u2019s Home", "album": "The Good Book [Disc 1]"}], "artist": "The Alchemist"}
