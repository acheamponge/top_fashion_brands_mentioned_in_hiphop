Wanna make a future with you\nCan see, can do, can see, can do, can you?\nCan we get past history? Wanna make a future with you\n\n[Bridge]\nThere's only a few things that I really really get\nYeah, you know, I'm sure about that\nThere's only a few things that can knock me off my track\nYeah, cause I'm sure about that\nThere's only a few things that I really, really get\nYeah, you know, I'm sure about that\nThere's only a few things that can knock me off my track\nYeah, cause I'm sure about that\n\n[Verse 2]\nI keep it going like it's never enough\nChasing the masses and the things above\nSome people see planes, some people see drones\nSome people see a doom, some people see domes\n\n[Chorus]\nCan see, can do, can see, can do, can you?\nCan we get past history? Wanna make a future with you\nCan see, can do, can see, can do, can you?\nCan we get past history? Wanna make a future with you\n\n[Verse 3]\nI keep my shoulders up, my head all wrapped up\nCircumstances, it makes my mind fucked up\nI keep it cool when things are hot, act up\nI stay on it, on point, they can't catch up\n\n[Chorus]\nCan see, can do, can see, can do, can you?\nCan we get past history? Wanna make a future with you\nCan see, can do, can see, can do, can you?\nCan we get past history?

Heineken Black, Sonnen, that's what we do, yes\nBrought what? Side to side, but nothing spill, ust a bit on my shoelace\n\n[Chorus]\nCan see, can do, can see, can do, can you?\nCan we get past history?
