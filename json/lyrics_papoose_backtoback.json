"Dear god, say it ain't so\nYeah, it's so that's right\nPapoose and Canibus collaboration\nYo Canibus set it off man, let's go\n\n[Canibus]\nJesus Christ, my name should be Jeebus Mic\nEven when I rip this shit fans leave up tight\nCan-I-bus spit is in my blood, I'm blessed\nOutside the bones, but inside the flesh\nAnd yes, if I was focused I could crush you\nCuz you sayin you focused, then how come I can still touch you?\nI crush you, then spit some young buck shit at you\nCuz I still got the heart to go bust me a head or two\n\n[Papoose]\nI could rhyme with the best and the worst of them\nFrom the second to first of em'\nAll the rest of em', I'm certain\nI'm disrespectin them, hurtin them\nI'm injectin a verse in them\nMis complexion is worsening\nWhats expectin, I'm burnin em'\nTake the flesh and the earth of em'\nMy profession is cursin them\nGettin higher than turbulence\nForce bang, soul train\nResurrection and further son\nRepresentin the burnerson\nHit the rest of his nervous men\nBrooklyn up, Hook em' up\nDisconnected and murdered him\n\n[Canibus]\nThe perfect music machine, mechanical being\nThe most lyrical digital stream, the world has ever seen\nI did, I do, I does, I am a real B\nI was the same nigga you love\nBut slugs rain from the sky\nIt's like the angels want me to die\nThey push me harder cuz they want me to try\nA pit bull off the leash, barkin speech\nLike a bull in a pit that can't walk or eat\n\n[Papoose]\nTell the king, I'm the castles boss\nKeep your eyes on the path you cross\nI have you bought, no matter the cash you cost\nRun in your bathroom and blast you off\nYou couldn't stop the lead showers\nIf you washed with a gat proofed cloth\nThe mafia be thinkin Black's too soft\nThat's why I'm quick to catch em' eat spaghetti\nMake them bleed ragu sauce\nBetter pocket the cash you lost\nCuz yo I'll put the infrared to your nose\nAnd have niggas callin you Rudolph\n\n[Canibus]\nI feel like the worlds mine, I can park in the street\nKick the worlds illest rhyme, police officers is weak\nPeople layin on concrete exhausted from heat\nWatchin John Kerry spit over some Michael Moore beats\nThis is a lil something that my repertoire boasts\nI almost was in control of all coasts\nI get a fan, rhymes they quote they all dope\nTold them lyrical landslide, gimme all folks\n\n[Papoose]\nStreet philosophy, I was the first nigga to speak it logically\nKeep a policy, bring it out of me\nStreet's are poverty\nYo I turn you into a vegetable and eat your broccoli for mockin me\nAfter robbin, we repeat the robbery\nMy life is like a puzzle, don't even think of solvin me\nPresidents like democracy, tryna get richer than 3 economies\nCalm and collected, if you bring out the other side of me\nI'll leave you bodily weak and wobbly\n\n[Canibus]\nBut I can be as quiet as they want me to be\nCuz even though they say my name they ain't talkin to me\nThey talk to magazines, they talk to mtv\nThey up in 106 and bet talkin to free\nBig niggas actin tough\nBut they walk like their ankles is cuffed\nWho gives a fuck if your ankles is buff?\nI could articulate, I want to participate\nCuz you can't hold me back with plaque goin number 8\n\n[Papoose]\nThese backstabbers tryna bring death to pap\nI still got my life, so you got a deathless trap\nMad cuz his pinkie ring in his necklace match\nHis ring so wide he could put a ref in that\nAnd who said a rapper goin neck to neck with pap\nNext time you bobbin to my song, hope your neck jus snap\nI eat em' with my wreckless rap\nWhen slay introduce me to rappers he say\nHere, this is breakfast pap\n\n[Canibus]\nI pick the microphone up and sparked the debate\nEver since 98, I been a target for hate\nJesus Christ, my name should be Jeebus Mic\nEven when I rip this shit fans leave up tight\nFuck it I'm in the middle of little Italy\nWith a middle man that didn't know diddly\nSo I killed him lyrically\nThe Big Pun energy enters me, strengthens me\nLay you on the floor shoot you in the back\nMake you centipede\nMy center speed is 10 over 3\nMC times kayslay over the mothafukkin mp\nMy fan base sit and wait for the coming\nThey couldn't follow the leader long enough so I..\n\n[Papoose]\nI bang with a naughty silencer\nAssassinatin your corny character\nYou cop nicks, I got more black then early Africa\nShorty nice, Short hungry, Shorty wildin huh?\nTell that lil bastard I'll feed em' the forty caliber\nYour bars is Rikers Island bars, I'm early Attica\nBring it to all these scavengers\nI come from the realist city\nWhere niggas put red bull in they henny\nYou don't got love for the person you send to stick me\nSoon as your man try grip the semi\nI'ma hit em' between the \"eyes\"  like the 'S' in Mississippi\nTot' the pretty semi through any city\nI'm really gritty, plus I'm pretty wity\nSpit plenty bidney, on plenty hiteys\nSpent the pretty penny, on plenty remy\nYou pity-pity dudes itty bity\nI'm illy willy you shitty smitty\nYous a silly billy, smoke plenty phillies\nTot' 50-50's, heard you gon' stick me\nHere kitty kitty, come get me get me\nShoot the chitty-chitty bang bang, really through any city\nFuck with many many, men want really I split his kidney\nGet insey, don't piss me, hit me, your wrist be shakin risky\nActin frisky, Guinea piggies frisk me you better clip me\nI get busy when it come to the flizzey, I get you dizzy\nPapoose carry the Milli without Vanilli", "year": null}]}
