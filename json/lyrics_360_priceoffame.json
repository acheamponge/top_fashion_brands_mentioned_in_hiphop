What\u2019s the price of fame?\n\n[Verse 1: 360]\nYeah\nYo, what\u2019s attracting people to the life of fame?\nThe nights away binging, getting blind for days\nWould you expect a tidal wave of guys\nAll disguised as mates to try to take a slice of that pie you made?\nWhen you\u2019re famous, you\u2019re the person people like to hate\nAre you prepared for all the rumours and the lies they say?\nYo, looking back at life, I\u2019d never thought I\u2019d go this far\nYo, I\u2019m just thankful people welcomed me with open arms\nAll these new friends and people that I hope to trust\nTry to take advantage, got me thinking what their motives are?\nGirl, if the light's on, on your iPod\nAnd it\u2019s my songs then drive on 'cause a fan is not what I want\n\n[Hook: Gossling]\nFame, cars, lights stay on you\nCameras flashing for you\nI\u2019d trade it all on the way\nTo happiness. What\u2019s the price of-\nFame, cars, lights stay on you\nCameras flashing for you\nI\u2019d trade it all on the way\nTo happiness. What\u2019s the price of fame?\nWhat\u2019s the price of fame?\nWhat\u2019s the price of fame, fame, fame, fame\nFame, fame, fame, fame\nWhat\u2019s the price of fame?\n\n[Verse 2: 360]\nYeah\nImagine it, never thought I\u2019d be havin\u2019 it\nKeep belief and be confident\nBut stay away from that arrogance\nYeah, I\u2019m cashing in\nThat ain\u2019t what\u2019ll bring happiness\nAnd I\u2019m lucky, making a living off of this music\nThat\u2019s what my passion is\nAnd I could go and buy a crazy, fresh Mercedes-Benz\nBut I would rather help my mates in debt and pay their rent\nYo, I could make a trip to ATMs at 8am\nAfter I\u2019ve been placing bets and partying for days on end\nLook what\u2019ll happen if I never see the same success\nYo, in the schemes of things, I think there\u2019s better ways to spend\nWhen I was young, I saw my grandpa get laid to rest\nAnd what I\u2019ve got, I\u2019d trade it in\nIf I could see his face again\n\n[Hook: Gossling]\nFame, cars, lights stay on you\nCameras flashing for you\nI\u2019d trade it all on the way\nTo happiness. What\u2019s the price of-\nFame, cars, lights stay on you\nCameras flashing for you\nI\u2019d trade it all on the way\nTo happiness. What\u2019s the price of fame?\nWhat\u2019s the price of fame?\nWhat\u2019s the price of fame, fame, fame, fame\nFame, fame, fame, fame\nWhat\u2019s the price of-\nFame, cars, lights stay on you\nCameras flashing for you\nI\u2019d trade it all on the way\nTo happiness. What\u2019s the price of fame?\n\n[Outro: 360 & Gossling]\nAin\u2019t about all the money made\nWhat\u2019s the price of fame?\nThink about what you wanna pay\nAin\u2019t about all the money made\nThink about what you wanna pay"}]}
