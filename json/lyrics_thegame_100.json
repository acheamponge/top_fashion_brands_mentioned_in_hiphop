"[Intro: The Game]\nReal nigga shit\nOther night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB\nWe just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life\nPlayed some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nNiggas called me to set you up\nWant me to come and wet you up\n'Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie\nHeard about the shit with Diddy\nSo I came through to vest you up\nAnd I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush\nA vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what\nI got L.A. unified\nYou better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us\nSee, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus\nNiggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up\nTax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money\nNigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus\nDawg, fame is a motherfucker\nDo a nigga four favors when you can't do the fifth\nHow soon they forget?\nRun up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'\nHow a nigga s'posed to love you niggas?\nHeart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas\nDrake told me not to trust you niggas\nYour energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas\nJust walkin' 'round the crib like, \"Why a nigga can't live?\"\nGet this money, fuck these bitches though\nThinkin' 'bout the beef like:\n\"We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical\"\nThis my city, nigga, everybody know it\nRidin' 'round town, just me and my Four Pound\nTucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit\nNiggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard\nLike the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up\n\n[Chorus: Drake & The Game]\nY'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit\nY'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit\nY'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me\nAll I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid\nL.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid\nL.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid\nAll I ever asked is one\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nThank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'\nThank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors\nTo every single fuckin' function\nHad niggas tell me to my face how we were family\nAnd how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget\nNow, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny\nPeople been reachin' out to me\nAnd I'm on some straight unresponsive shit\nI would have so many friends\nIf I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments\nI would have so many friends\nIf I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments\nI would have all of your fans\nIf I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit\nI would have so many more friends\nIf I lost my success and my confidence\nI'm in the club every time that they play the competition\nIf they even play the competition and I seen the response they get\nYeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid\nMight go to Jamaica, disappear again\nMy circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself\n\n[Chorus: Drake & The Game]\nY'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit\nY'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit\nY'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me\nAll I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid\nL.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid\nL.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid\nAll I ever asked is one\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nMiss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga\nHeld a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga\nIf he was still alive, he would kill niggas\nHe was Lil' Snupe, I was Meek Mill\nNiggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though\nCan't think, so you roll up that indigo\nStressin' while drivin' down Figuero'\nBlowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn\nMake a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, \"Here it go\"\nScreamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though\nGuess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though\nYou niggas don't feel me though\nThat was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch\nYou dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though\nNot even to H-Town\nSo underground that I gotta be a trill nigga\nStrapped up from the waist down\nThat's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga\nShit was so simple when Henchman was out\nHe had a young nigga right there with Meech\nSo happy when Bleu Davinci got out\nWe came up on these California streets\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit\nNiggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard\nLike the Lil Wayne and Baby shit\nGot a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?\nDon't even matter, dawg, cause I'ma always be a real nigga\nAlways be a real nigga\nI never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga\n\n[Chorus: Drake & The Game]\nY'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit\nY'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit\nY'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me\nAll I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid\nL.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid\nL.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid\nL.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid\nAll I ever asked is one"}]}
