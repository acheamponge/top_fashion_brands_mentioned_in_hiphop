I found my purpose, and finally\nI could write a positive message\n'Cause teachers had their eye on me\nSome tried to spy on me, over my shoulder\nRemember one teacher asked what I wrote and I showed her\nRead the shit out loud for the class but I was proud\n'Cause it all made sense and since\nYeah, I vowed to be Grand High Imperial, Large Professor\nKnow the one that be on the tape, bars of pressure\nThen combine them little songs and do right, not wrong\nI owe it all to the institution now back home called-\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo now the years float by on the calendar\nAnd some of my peers, they know the guy from the ground up\nOften appear, here and there and all around the\nG-L-O-B, they roll out, they here the sound of the Do Double B?\nIn the halls and on the lunch lines, tryin' to impede\nOn the bars and the punchlines\nBack in the days when I was basically unsigned\nAt one time, but dreams come true and now I'm\nAt the top of my game when I be layin' it down\nWalkin' on the same road I've been pavin' since Bowne\nEveryday when I be makin' my way into town\nVia Main and was [?] and I think about-\n\n[Hook]\nBowne, Bowne (Out in Queens)\nBowne, Bowne (Flushing to be exact)\nBowne, Bowne\nBowne, Bowne\nBowne, Bowne (Down the block on Main Street)\nBowne, Bowne\nBowne, Bowne\nBowne, Bowne"}], "artist": "Large Professor"}
