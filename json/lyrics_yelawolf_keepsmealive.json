Daddy used to be just like you\nWhen I would walk up to the bus\nAnd I'd do anything in the world for you, so chase your dreams\nOne day you'll use everything you've been through to be anything, baby girl\nThis is my story\n\n[Chorus: Wynonna Judd]\nThis is my story\nThis is my glory\nThis is what keeps me alive\nThis is me flying\nThis is me trying\nThis is what keeps me alive", "title": "Keeps Me Alive"}]}
