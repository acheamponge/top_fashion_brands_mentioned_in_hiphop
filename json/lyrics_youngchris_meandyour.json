Switching positions\nStick the key in ignition\nAnd she ride until she run out of gas\nAnd she a spurter, so literally\nShe cumming out fast\nPut my palm on that ass, turn that\nWaist back around. Before I come she\nTurn her face back around\nSay I tell that her lay down\nOpen your thighs, til that boy go\nBack inside", "album": null, "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/4b6d7fe9bbb80c2e12add9c4118de77a.395x395x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young Chris"}
