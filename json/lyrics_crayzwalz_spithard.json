I ain\u2019t come in no office to waste...\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nSpit hardballs\u2014I ate the jail cell\nA hot boy for real.  What the deal?  I made hell (Whoo!)\nTo come out right and dumb out like\n\u201cYo!  I get my day together, man, after I break night\u201d\nI break records (What?)\u2014mostly wack vinyl\nI\u2019m a Bad Boy, but don\u2019t let my Shyne blind you\nI bling like cash registers in microwaves\nThis beat got me flipping like Psycho Rayz\nBut see, Walz is still the name I claim (Uh huh)\nI spit so nasty, I could actually stain my fame\nAnd it won\u2019t come out like white pants with grass stains\nBlast brains out the side of your frame at close range\nI want change, treble, and bass\nTo the point my impact might crack a track and level the place\nAll devils gets chased \u2018til I catch a case\nLike a UPS worker with a box in your face\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nSpit hard!  (Spit hard!), keep rocking the mic\nSpit hard!  (Yeah!)\nSpit hard!  (Yeah!), keep rocking the mic\nSpit hard!  Bitch, no ho\u2019s bars\nSpit hard!  (Spit hard!), keep rocking the mic\nSpit hard!  (Yeah!)\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nWhat's a hot verse without a fire chorus?\nI\u2019ll knock you out, then punch you in the Eye of Horus\nThis is human gat rap\u2014I clap, off safety\nToo much games out right now for you to play me\nSpit it off the top like sunroofs with a Uzi out\nAnd bubble in the place to be like Jacuzzi house\nHorrible like H\u00e4gar, Hawkmen in the hood\nFly nigga.  I wish you would and could touch mine\nThat\u2019s my dick.  Don\u2019t clutch mines\nI\u2019ve been spitting rhymes since Monroe High School lunchtimes\nSmoking L\u2019s in stairways.  My rhymes is hearsay\nYou stupid critic.  When I spit it, you hear what I say\nPolitic with smart niggas on dumb blocks\nThe place where basslines sound like gunshots\nWhen the cops come, the fun stops (Chill)\nWhen I spit heat, you see sunspots and get burned without sunblock\nYou come/cum watch like sperm on your clock\nBut you should work for my knuckles and start earning a knot\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nSpit hard!  (Spit hard!), keep rocking the mic\nSpit hard!  (Yeah!)\nSpit hard!  (Spit hard!), keep rocking the mic\nSpit hard!  Bitch, no ho\u2019s bars\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nSteel cage match, 12-gauge rap\nIf you feel Rayz\u2019 clap/Rayz, clap\u2014what a powerful impact\nIn the zone, smoking bones alone with \u201cBones\u201d Malone\nCutting spades the same way I scraped your dome\nBases loaded\u2014right here\u2019s where I take it home\nYour face exploded from being laced with a basic poem (Oh shit)\n(Spit hard!) Like I\u2019m chewing a stone\nInto a glass pipe (Yeah!)\u2014still rocking a mic\nDropping it like a shot\u2014you get wobbly, wobbly\nLike crooked cops on block who try to follow me\nNothing I splash is weak.  I speak like a flash of the acid leak\nSlave to the rhythm and give \u2018em a masterpiece (Voil\u00e0)\nDoomsday dialect dominate dialogue\nChange your dull college dorm to a dancehall (Dope)\nNo heroin, crack, X, liquor, and weed\nI\u2019m Brand Nubian (What?)\u2014I \u201cSlow Down\u201d to catch speed\nI slap MCs who don\u2019t spit hard like C\nAnd the front row is beef\u2014prepare to catch teeth\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nSpit hard!  (Spit hard!), keep rocking the mic\nSpit hard!  (Yeah!)\nSpit hard!  (Spit hard!), keep rocking the mic\nSpit hard!  Bitch, no ho\u2019s bars\n\n[Bridge: C-Rayz Walz] (x8)\nSpit hard!\n\n[Outro: C-Rayz Walz]\nWhat?  Still rocking"}]}
