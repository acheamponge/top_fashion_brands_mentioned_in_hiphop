I know the truth hurts\nThey say, \"How can he disrespect his Pop with harsh curses?\"\nSimple: harsh life, harsh verses\n\"I can't believe the mouth of this prick\nHe said, 'put his mouth on his dick'\"\nI know we gotta talk 'bout that, I know you salt 'bout that\nYou on the tip like I don't like you\nI got four kids, three baby mothers - I'm just like you\nSometimes I want to just fight you, shit\nSwing on you, think I'm playing man? I'm just like you\nI was a kid with a puzzle with missing pieces\nTrying to put it together dawg,, you put it together\nYou made me have to foot through the weather\nIn the storm with no raincoat\nI don't only speak on me, I speak upon the kids in the same boat\nRiding the same water, same situation, same fatherless daughter\nI hate you, that's in your mind, don't get caught up in the rhyme\nYou think I dissed you now, that I don't miss you now\nDon't be a hater now, be glad I made it now\nI know I probably rubbed you the wrong way\nBut fuck what the song say, for the record, check it\n\n[Hook: Rell]\nStill got love for you, though you left me in the cold\nTo face this world alone, and make it on my own\nI still got love for you, but I just can't fight the pain\nIt's so hard not to hate, but you grow up in a way\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nI think you misunderstood me the first time...\nListen, that was my hurt in my heart talking, along with the truth\nI would thirst often as a youth, cause of you the person\nMom's nursing self-esteem issues\nRound the house it's hard to find a clean tissue, minus her tears\nTo rewind this time I promise I'd minus my years\nTo the day to take the pain away\nSeemed sunny outside, always rained on Jay\nPop you my umbrella, come help your son with the weather\nSoon we come together like man and man and build\nPlay spades, cards face up, I've come to deal\nIn order to get right we gotta deal with this wrong\nAnd the pain I felt all my life you feel in the song\nYour lack of warmth left a chill in the morn'\nYour lack of love left me loveless, and I'm of your breath\nI'm your mind, body, and soul, your heart, your flesh\nYour alcohol, your smoke, it results I'm a mess\nAnd Dad, still I love you no less Dad\nHope you didn't think success would make me less mad\nBut not mad, just disapointed, we wasted years\nI swear to God, may you take me away from here\nIf you taught me anything\nThe one thing you taught me is to face my fears, coward\nHow could you let me grow without you?\nGrind in this rap game, take dough without you?\nWear my Pro Keds close to the sole without you?\nFamily pictures pose without you\nWhy?! Why shouldn't I be mad?\nMonster's parents separated, Monster had his Dad\nThese parents had they problems, he still came to the pad\nHe bought 'em new bikes, imagine what that felt like\nUsed to have to bump my head to go to sleep at night\nNigga you did me wrong but the love is strong\nLet's move on\n\n[Hook: Rell]\nStill got love for you, though you left me in the cold\nTo face this world alone, and make it on my own\nI still got love for you, but I just can't fight the pain\nIt's so hard not to hate, but you grow up in a way\nStill got love for you, though you left me in the cold\nTo face this world alone, and make it on my own\nI still got love for you, but I just can't fight the pain\nIt's so hard not to hate, but you grow up in a way", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf8c5034f8552cd568d53398bc41222f.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2001-06-26", "title": "Still Got Love For You", "album": "The Reason"}]}
