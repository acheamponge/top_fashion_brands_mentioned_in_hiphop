This Bud's for you\nTaste shots in the brew, brew with the pot\nBlunts with Newport smoke\n\nYou fuckin' kids better shut-up before I have to choke\nThe living shit\nBack and forth to the bathroom to piss\nBy the end of the night incoherently mumbling\nStumbling in the bedroom like \"fuck you bitch\"\nWake up and pretend nothing happened\nThat's marital bliss\nBut wait!\nThe DVD's got special features\nAnd D.O.D got them Schwarzenegger heaters\nChoppers, egg beaters\nArms long enough to box with G.O.D\nBut the M.E. watch for blasphemers\nRoadside bomb blast cost your son his femurs\nWent to Walter Reed and he ain\u2019t want to see ya\n\nCame back to the block, hot boys talking that Benz or a Beamer\nRims shining, chain body, you can smell that good reefer\nYou're broke\nYou're mad when they come home laughing off misdemeanours\nAnd they don't like you neither\nCall your daughter out a name like the average skeezer\nAnd their bitches is bad, look like the Queen of Sheba\nWhen you drinking you get to thinking you might square them off like Little Caesars\nYour woman said \"chill\" but that hundred proof had you nice\nThe negros lumped you, real they stabbed you with the knife\nPunctured lung, shattered eye socket and just for fun\nThe young'uns ran your damn pockets\n\n(sirens)\n\n[Outro]"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
