Don't do it you won't make it out it\nTurn a rock to dead presidents just like a mountain\nTwo door Audi, Kodak where you go it?\nThis right here? I got that bitch from what you call it\nThese hoes thirsty, line 'em up and call 'em a water fountain\nTryna direct for me, send me to the county\nSame niggas say they love me, same niggas doubt me\n\n[Hook]\nI'm antisocial, get from round me\nTryna hit the top, don't try and down me\nFour diamond rings on, I pull off in the Audi\nI'm ballin' now, got more bucks than Milwaukee\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey wonder how he\nStay designer Down\nHe from out of town, how the hell he run this town?\nHe be always flossin', pull up in the 'Rari\nOh my God, I'm sorry\nCracker do you pardon?\nHad to jump before I flew, remember I was crawlin'\nTook a dose of cough syrup, I ain't even coughin'\nAnd I'm fly like Batman but my jeans Robin\nTime is money, waste my time then it's gonna cost 'em\nFresh to death like Houdini jump right out the coffin\nOh, moon walk in 'em, higher than a martian\nGang activity, blood drippin' from my bottles\nFuck a pacifier, lean all in my baby bottle\n\n[Hook]\nI'm antisocial, get from round me\nTryna hit the top, don't try and down me\nFour diamond rings on, I pull off in the Audi\nI'm ballin' now, got more bucks than Milwaukee"}]}
