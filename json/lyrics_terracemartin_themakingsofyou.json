My day is fine\nI couldn't help but notice you with them pretty eyes\nPretty eyes, pretty smile makes a pretty face\nSmart woman, sweet spirit makes a fun chase\nAnd if you didn't know; you are a star\nLike my momma said most women are\nSee you the back palm of the whole thang\nBless is dripping off ya, like a drop of rain\nPlus you know the words so you know what love is\nBring it through Corinthians all the way to Galatians\nBring it through Galatians all the way to Ephesians\nHopin' that ya feelin' this, every man needs this\nAnd that's the truth\nFrom my heart to the pen to the mic to the booth\nSo full from ya spirit, plus ya stomach too\nShine bright like the sun; that's the makings of you, boo\n\n[Hook]\nThese are, the makings of you, of you\nYou are my dream come true\nSo these are, the makings of you, of you\nYou are my dream come true\nSo these are the makings of you\nYou are my dream come true\n\n[Verse 2: OverDoz.]\nShe be waking up in fog still out in the morning to walk to work\nNo bra, T-shirt, jeans; I bet them feet hurt\nMy thesis states we are working for each other\nYou find a decent man when you find a decent woman\nIt's crazy how my decisions affect the life we choose\nSo I gotta strive to be a better man creating a better you\nAnd I know it gets hard and I know it get dark\nBut keep at it baby doll, night's the only time you see the stars\n\nAnd I done put you through some pain I can see the scars\nBack and forth this who we are\nThem lies you be telling and I ain't trippin'\nI be doing my dirt to boo but when I hear I don't kiss them, I promise\nMy partner saying that ain't cool but thats the smell of your perfume\nIt's got me up to you and when I can I'mma show what you worth too\nA chick that understands who I am too plus I like the way you dance boo\nYour so beautiful man dont let nobody pinch me your a dream come true\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Kurupt]\nFrom the day you was born I was like wow\nIncredible love child the makings the birth\nEverything that I was wishing you were\nYou are shining like the moon sun and the stars\nGlamorous inception of selection of my intellection\nThe reception that I'm feeling inside indescribable\nHow could I describe you?\nMe; because that is all that I see\n\n[Terrace Martin]\nYou don't even need make-up, brain like a scientist\nStrength of a lioness, pride of the black fist\nSweet like a hershey kiss\nWe on top of the world and we're in total bliss\nSee it's lot of you that makes up a lot of me\nThat makes me feel like I gotta be truthful, humble\nLove God too\nThat's the makings of me and that's the makings of you\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Terrace Martin"}
