We want \u2018Bis!\nWe want the rapper with the illest lyrics!\"\nMy dedication and my commitment's beginning-less\nI can go four quarters or nine innings for this\nGo twelve rounds, play two days of cricket for this\nLead crusades across Europe, like the Christians for this\nThe notion I'm dedicated is an understatement\nMy rhymes are out of this world like the Russian space-station\nSneak-attack rappers, grab 'em and slash 'em\nChop their heads off with claws sharper than velociraptors\nHunt 'em, like Jurassic Park actors\nBut spare Samuel Jackson's life\n\u2018Cause he was the only black one\nAction-packed like Shaft, the black assassin\nBlastin' the .753 backwards Magnum\nFollow me down the road to Damascus\nDo not follow these madmen, poppin' ecstasy pills like aspirin\nI and I come fe manifest the most high\nDrink a gallon of cyanide and still cannot die\nNiggas want to lock the \u2018Chronicles of Canibus' away forever\nAnd put my book of rhymes through a shredder\nNever, I'm way too clever the way I manoeuvre\nBeat your ass, like Lennox Lewis did to David Tua\nIn front of a hundred-million pay-per-viewers\nYour career is ruined\nYour face will be swollen, like the Benihana Buddha\nBring it to ya, prove you're a loser\nBeyond the length of this rhyme you have no future\nPounce upon you, like a puma or some wild cougars\nIn the jungle with my adrenaline juices flowing through 'em\nI'ma reprogram everything that you're doin'\nHypnotize the audience you perform in front of to start booin'\nYou're stupid, you and your whole crew are extremely foolish\nI can't cipher with you, \u2018cause your breath is too putrid\nPut your mic down and step away from it!\nShut your motherfucking mouth and don't say nothin'!\nYou have the right to remain silent\nSentenced to life on Rikers Island for terrible freestylin'\n\n[Verse 2: Canibus]\nI heard a rumor English women make love the best\nIs that true? \u2018Cause I ain't had no justice yet\nA lot of clowns keep arguing on who the best is\nBite the style but can't digest it\n'Til they get karate-kicked in the mouth\nAnd their teeth get ejected\nTold you to watch who you beef with on the last record\nPlatinum teeth? I sell them for a thousand pounds a piece\nYou buy one back and you get one free\nPut it down in the East, put it down in the West\nPut it down on paper, put the paper down on the desk\nIn the studio is where I put it down to the test\nIt's nothing but skull-crushing pressure down at them depths\nThrow a rough mix down, download it to disk\nGive a copy to everybody that's down with Bis\nSince '96, the Dogg Pound Remix\nFirst time anybody put me down to spit\nIt's like Pac Man, don't stop, 'til I hear my voice\nBanging up and down the block in a Magnavox\nWith a hundred watts\nCreating ripples in the water, like aquanauts\nBreathing through their oxygen-box\nI belong on top of the pops, not on the bottom with rocks\nI mean, honest to God, I'm shocked\nI thought the album was hot\nI guess you can't write an infinite rhyme with a finite mind\nThat's why rhymes like mine mystify mankind\nA lot of rappers are ahead of their time\nBut when it comes to rhymes like mine\nThe word \"time\" doesn't apply\nYou see, rhyming is the art\nThe microphone is the paintbrush\nResponsible for getting the point across\nThe canvas is the street, where the Master of the Ceremony paints the picture for everybody to see\nNobody could rhyme this fluent\nNobody ever did what I'm doin'\nNobody ever spit what I'm spewin'\nI'm the illest alive and I'ma prove it, plus I've got to show the people that I've got mad love for Rap music\nI bury MC's with rosary beads\nA picture of their wife and their seeds and a picture of me\nI'm as graceful as the left hand of Rembrandt\nPut some instrumentals on\nAnd ask my pen to dance; I'm such a gentleman\nPull out chairs, open doors, never offend my fans\nUnless they offend me and I lose my temper, man"}]}
