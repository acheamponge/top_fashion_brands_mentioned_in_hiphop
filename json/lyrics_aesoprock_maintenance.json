Dragon. Up hell's creek interrupting a devil pageant\nStarfighter settle into madness\nI keep my ghoul spirit concealed\nUntil The Warriors return to the Coney Isle Wonder Wheel\n\n[Hook:]\nMy mama told me there'd be days like this, days like this, days like this\nDays like this... (Yes she did)\n\n[Verse 2:]\n(Okay) Tell me who you chill with, and I'll tell you who you are\nI walk a mile with a leash attached to your freak seminar\nIt's a modern sensation on the boulevards of maintenance\nTo sweep your broken hopes under the rug then hug the playpen\nIt's revolution pushing through the loose pins\nOf the straight-jacketed maverick classed in a bunk category\nThey had him parallel with a tattered glory division\nAka them who drink dreams out a thermos with a whiskey after-burn\nIt's like, 9 o'clock wake (I'm up), spit obscenities\nMy girl ties on my cape, smoke a bone, then work my deviltry\nThe clear day's laced with a classic mother nature thunder chaser set\nThat got my paper crane's wings wet (oh no)\nVoyeurist amendments lacked expansive coverage in the syllabus\nI dance for chuckles while you man the keyhole grilling post (that's fine)\nI done my chores according to God's schedule\nWith coffee holding the wheel and nicotine working the pedals\nMetal-edged cadence that tends to repel the bevel\nKettle screeching out the operetta (operetta)\nI live to autograph the iron curtain with dove's backfeather pens spurting magma\nCurs\u00e9d television earns the burdens of my Cleopatra\nMinor, (M-M-Major). Disperse slap on the wrist\nFor the tenants lacking arms to harbor the rarity of thick friendship\nSunk with a \"yes sir\" chained to fatigued ankle leagues beneath the angle I'mma call home 'til the Rock meets the angels", "title": "Maintenance", "album": "Daylight", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7aee135d16898a4fac2a490d41fb0b19.600x600x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
