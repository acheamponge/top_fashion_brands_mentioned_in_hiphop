Across the world\nLeaving trails of hoes that got they heart broke\nI puff the dark smoke, usually, mix it with greens, look what it do to me:\nHave me fucked up before puberty\nIf I had one wish and the shit'll come true\nA nigga live to be a hundred and two\nAll I need is a two-pay, call it a new day\nImmigrant prostitutes like \"papa how much you pay?\"\nGot to lose weight, niggas say I'm way too big\nBad habits, call a shop, and stay way too jigg, motherfucker", "year": null}]}
