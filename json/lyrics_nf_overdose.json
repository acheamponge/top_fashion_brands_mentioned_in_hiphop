Oh no, it's just begun (c'mon)\nYou can call me special feature, yeah it's nice to meet ya\nBut my name is not what I came to teach ya\nYo, I know a God who can save ya, won't leave ya\nHe don't show His face, well He don't really need to\nI give Him the glory for everything I have\nHe's more than just a story or something of the past\nI ain't afraid to talk about it, ain't afraid to act\nSee, I'm just being me, man, and I don't need a mask\nYou all about the fast life, livin' for the money\nA lot of people act like rap, tight gunnin'\nRunnin' from the cops, see, to me that's nothing\nBut according to you, yeah, that might mean somethin'\nThat's why I give it to you in a form you understand\nCause sometimes in life things never go as planned\nAnd sometimes you might feel like there's no chance\nQuit tryna control it and just put it in His hands\nYou feel me?\n\n[Chorus]\nHe could be your comfort when you're broken\nI'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah\nI don't care, let it overflow\nHe could be your Savior, be your friend\nI'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah\nI don't care, let it overflow\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf God's so real, why the world so crazy?\nThe rape rate climbin' and girl's havin' babies\nMurders in the streets, murders in the schools\nIf God really cared He wouldn't let the pain pursue\nBut a lot o' y'all are lookin' from the wrong angle\nAnd overdose in sin, and hey, your whole life tangles\nYou look in the Bible, even Satan was an angel\nThat just goes to show what lust for power will create you\nInto something crazy, into something pitiful\nYou don't want the truth now, you'll get it at your funeral\nSome think it's a joke, overdose, keep laughing\nAin't gon' be so funny when you layin' in your casket\nGod, He can save you; I ain't tryna play you\nI'm just tryna represent the one and only Savior\nLies of the world will leave you like a broken heart\nHey, you lookin' for the same thing that tore you apart\n\n[Chorus]\nHe could be your comfort when you're broken\nI'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah\nI don't care, let it overflow\nHe could be your Savior, be your friend\nI'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah\nI don't care, let it overflow\n\n[Verse 3]\nGod could be your overdose, so let me explain it\nYe ain't got the picture yet, you got the wrong paint\nNow I know I'm hittin' you with a lot of information\nBut what I'm tryna do is introduce you to a Savior (Jesus)\nI worship a God that made the world in six days\nI worship a God that will never turn away (turn away)\nI worship for truth, yeah, I worship for faith\nAnd even if you kill me, you couldn't take that away\nI'm livin' for that overdose, someone get me high\nI'mma represent Him with my flow until I die\nDevil say you're hopeless, it's just all up in your mind\nI'd rather die for truth than live forever for a lie\n\n[Chorus]\nHe could be your comfort when you're broken\nI'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah\nI don't care, let it overflow\nHe could be your Savior, be your friend\nI'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah\nI don't care, let it overflow\n\n[Outro]\nHe could be, He could be your comfort\nHe could be, He could be your Savior"}], "artist": "NF"}
