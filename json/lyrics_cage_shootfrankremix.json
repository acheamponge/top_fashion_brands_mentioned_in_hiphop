Darryl Palumbo)\n\nCage:\nOne last vein to poke made it too dark to see this\nScenery slips then line up to go in the ground and leave us\nSo repeat this till I'm sick and I won't feed this\nTo my little girl who kept me in this world to beat this\nAs a little kid taught to follow Jesus\nGet to the front of the line I'm bein' lead by elitists\nSo when I speak words that I don't mean\nIt's like I'm only in a cloud to wonder what serene is\nUnable to wake and delete the reasons\nOr be the same bed I made up to sleep with demons\nWhether sick sane of a pattern repeated\nIf I spit pain I knew how to relieve it\nIf at sixteen I had started to treat it\nTill my shit changed whether or not I would need it\nTo trace back to the face before the fetus\nIf the departure was wrong from the gate then she is\n\nDaryl Palumbo:\nTrigger finger itch\nThe son of a snitch\nI'm the rat's favorite son\nLast to pal and cut\nSlit to bleed the rust\nBy the last heart I've won\nWe roll under covers waiting\nI've tied off a limb debating\nIf all of the names forsaken\nSpell out what I'm takin'\nWatching the skin pop\n\nI would do anything to\nTell you what I've been late to\nFix up my head and escape to\nWhere I can rest my eyes\n\nCage:\nThe sun says wake up with a beam in my eyes\nClutchin' the bed like she's still by my side part of me died\nEven when I prescribed still just to be ostracized\n'Cuz she don't really know if she wants to ride or drive\nWhile no nooses long enough to hang my excuses\nWhether I'm dead, gun to my head, or reclusive\nThe end is close almost no need for money\nYet when I wished for death nobody took my life from me\nIf I cannot see what's right in front of me\nAnd the lights on there still wouldn't be enough to leave\nI fixed me when I broke the aggression\nBut I'm still attracted to my beautiful depression\nIf I felt emotions I learned to suppress 'em\nTill I'm ready to sleep I'll have found a place to rest then\nNo thanks to angst I learned my lesson\nAnd can erase the face that can't answer the questions\n\nDaryl Palumbo:\nTrigger finger itch\nThe son of a snitch\nI'm the rat's favorite son\nAnd by the time I'm back\nThat heart that beats so black\nLet it shine like his gun\nWe roll under covers waiting\nI've tied off a limb debating\nIf all of the names forsaken\nSpell out what I'm taking\nWatching the skin pop"}]}
