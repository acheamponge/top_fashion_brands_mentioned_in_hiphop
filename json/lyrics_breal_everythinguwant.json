Let's go\nHa, ha, ho\n\n[B-Real]\nIt's so close, I can feel it in my hands\nEverything I ever wanted and then some, about to expand man\nI can taste it, the flavor is so sweet\nStocks risin up, that's the word on the street\nIn spite of the hype, gotta keep my head on straight\nKeep my shit to myself and don't give my aces away\nI'm so tired I can feel it in my bones but the throne is so near\nI can hear these, hateful clones\nWhispered the words they won't say out loud\nBut you heard them praise me, under their breath some still hate me\nSo numb man I can't feel a thing\nAnd I ain't lettin nothin get in the way of what it is we bring\nI'm tryin to reach out, and grab the opportunity knockin\nIf I don't answer the door, it don't come often\nI'm so heated and I'm ready for whatever is needed\nI cheated death, my last words, at least I beat it - let's go\n\n[Hook]\nEverything you want, what'chu goin for\nTell 'em what'chu need so you don't need it any more\nHow we get the dough, what we get it fo'\nWhere you gonna be in ten years, let me know\n\n[Buckshot]\nI started out as an underground artist (uhh)\nUnderestimated, under the weather in undergarments\nUnder cars and, trucks, tryin to make a +Buck+\nBut I failed 'til I put +Shot+ down and stepped up\nKept up, crept up, couldn't keep your breath up\nCan't breathe? I think you should leave, yessir\nCause umm, ma'am, I am the first grand\nFrom the shotty papi got in his hand, got me? Damn\nStand, focus on your funds\nCause when you're broke it's no joke, it ain't no funnn\nIf my homies can't have none, how come\nYeah you got a label but unstable's your outcome?\nUhh, kinda shaky though (yeah) kinda make me go\nMmmmmm if I was you I wouldn'ta copped that Mercedes yo\nYou like the ladies though (huh) that's your downfall\nCause too much pussy mean more pussy around y'all\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Buckshot]\nBuckshot, B-Real, Black Moon, Cypress Hill\nEvery night is real, everybody move at the sight of steel\nCause we 'bout to get that dough\nWhen we get that dough, we gon' flip that so\n\n[B-Real]\nShe's so hot, I can tell you what she wants\nAnd I can tell you it's not me it's the bread go ahead and doubt it\nShe's about it, she can work it like a pro for dough\nAnd she knows I'm risin up like Survivor yo\nWith the +Eye of the Tiger+, settin tracks to fire\nBut I'm so cold, like Avon, hits for hire\nSick and tired, of these birds, pullin stunts for status\nLookin at us like we're their first class trips to Paris\nThat's so old, better try another method cause every second\nYou waste is another moment, you fail to face it\nEmbrace it, I feel a chill, so youser a pill\nTake no for an answer, right up in your grill\nShe's so smooth, tell you what you want to hear when she got her hands\nIn your pockets, until ain't nothin left in your wallet\nYeah, she wants a baller to follow and holla at her\nA homey of high stature with the fortune to capture\n\n[Hook] - 2X", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a84f5f2a93fac34de0ebb0407f26b392.600x600x1.jpg", "year": null}]}
