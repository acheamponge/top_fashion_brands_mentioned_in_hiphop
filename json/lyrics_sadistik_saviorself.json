Does it really really matter when you're entering a hearse?\nLook, I'm alone in a coma from the methadone searching for a saint that was frozen in a bed of snow\nAnd then I'll excavate the set of bones, easy come, easy go, better late than never though\nHere we go again, we can call it my defeat when my tongue is in my cheek for a solid ninety weeks\nSwallow pride and grief, it was all I really had, just so I can understand that is all that I can be\nAnd from a bird's-eye view, sixteen shots and I'll earn my dues\nSixteen shots and the world I knew is a resting plot for the kerbside blues\nI see a city trapped in amber full of all the joy and the misery that's captured\nBright lights emitting in a pattern by the fireflies like a symphony of lanterns\n\n[Hook: Kristoff Krane]\n\n[Verse 3: Bodi]\nTime to hit the road again, to get your soul again\nTo lay the bricks, pave it all and make some golden skin\nA little alchemist bones made aluminum\nCastle nine clouds, dreams found a way to ruin 'em\nBack to the basics, laugh with a facelift\nTrapped in the glass seek a crack that'll make it\nFade into black before the demons attack\nAnd it'll all fall down just to build it back up\nBack to the wall as you crawl through the dust\nThat's love, that's trust, that's what you gotta do\nWhen the only one to prove it to is you\nAnd you love it but you hate it and you made it on it on your own\nAnd wouldn't trade it for a thing until you're home\nInhale, exhale, prevail\nBeauty all around even when we fail\nMy holy grail is an empty cup\nBut enough to keep me going so drink drink it up\n\n[Verse 4: Eyedea]\nThat changes the whole scene, back breaking and no brain\nYou call it a lack of sleep, I call it God's coke-\nCaine sugar, I'm eye to eye with what you're looking for\nStreet smart, poison as a book worm\nI took turns trying to heal\nI look like I learned how to die when I fake a couple lies just to feel\nYou took a breath and give power to powder\nNow life leaving your eyes looks like a fish pulled out the water\nIt might be in disguise as the highest I can try\nOr your perfect lips, but don't lie to yourself if death ain't crawling towards\nFall apart, my windows are all walls and doors\nIt always seems simple when it's wearing the mask of small chore\nI'll force me onto me again\nFrom sea to shining sea I'll always drown in salt to keep my friends\nWeekends end and morning sick leaves my skin\nI've always been good with what was happening since I was kid\nCan you dig? You get the same off every hit\nBut you keep the light till your hunger pains to feed your fix\n\n[Hook: Kristoff Krane]\n\n[Verse 5: Kristoff Krane]\nGive me the thumbs up, or middle finger\nOn a scale from one to ten\nI'm a good dad but better sister\nIt's so hard for you to get the clue\nKnowing your dream catcher\nWill never catch the pitch you threw\nIf you knew better you prepare for the worst\nEither the worst gets the best of me\nOr the rest of me gets better first\nIt's all the same capillaries closes down\nCrushing veins, the blood could never make it out\nCatch the fairy with the feather in your cap\nYou gon pay a pretty penny for that pleasure in your lap\nThe cat purrs with the promise that acts\nLike an actor who was always better in the past\nYou got a chip on your shoulder, so it's cold\nCould have jumped hot springs, but instead waited for winter snow...\nSo now we're all walking down the same road\nIn the same pair of shoes ready to get back home!\n\n[Hook: Kristoff Krane]", "album": null}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
