(Me or them?)\nCause looks can be deceiving (So think again)\nAnd I done been deceived\nSo it's a lot of things that don't sit right with me\nSo be easy (cool my dude)\nWho do you believe in? (Me or them?)\nCause looks can be deceiving (When you me)\nAnd by the looks of things this shit ain't what it seems nigga\nJust give me a reason\n\n[Verse 2: Vince Staples]\nBullets holes in Momma whip\n7 chrome in my Momma couch\nWatchin' the way I'm walking before they run in my Momma House\nBaby bro with the problems, I promise he'll never talk it out\nGrammar school I draw on the lines, was born to chalk them out\n5-0's from the G-Unit in the raid van, but I seen through it\nGot a deuce 5 and the skate highs, that was 10th grade back in 09'\nGot a .45 soon as Nitty died, on the North side banging 65\nI don't give passes, back-back and shit-bag I'm shit drastic\nPiss-poor so I skip classes, still got on them Jays though\nNo problem nigga, I pop a nigga to get the shit that he paid for\nBrown bandana sittin' on my face, I'm a Yannc ho\nGot a black bitch from Bompton down to spank hoes\nNever hit the court room, stayin' with that Drake flow\nTrying to get that Drake dough, livin' where he started at\nEight ain't got no hammer just blam 'em ain't gotta cock it back\nBoyie\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Boldy James]\nAfter the first time it's pretty much a piece of cake\nSo if you ain't 'bout this life you probably can't relate to it\nIf you were silver spoon fed back in '88\nI had to eat with my hands out of paper plates\nMade my great escape\nSatan's greatest trick was convincing the world that he didn't exist\nSo meet the man out the myth, the devil in the flesh\nHell block, drugs zone seven six Detroit Michigan\nWe the new Bangladesh, the source and the fear\nI need a new weigh connect (trey six)\nTo give em to me for the two way\nBut of course that depends on if you make it back\n? have you ever perhaps been in a trap so hot you couldn't relax?\nSweatin' bullets, hunnit shots in a TEC\nGotta crook in my neck and it ain't no lookin' back\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c262e3e16e205e57432001e745db05b4.400x400x1.jpg"}]}
