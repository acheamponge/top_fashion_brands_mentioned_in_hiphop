What do you mean?\nI was so innocent, foolish and green\nYou were so dissonant, different and mean\nHello\nI've been trying to play it on the cello\nI got a couple numbers that I can develop\nWhen you finally let me go I'm thinking I'mma get 'em\nPlease\nBreaking through walls as if they made a scene\nBattering static, I'm trying not to scream\nYou've really been a world class bitch I should leave\nBut I'm finding it hard to just get off my knees\nTickets to pictures I wish not to see\nViciously bitter you're such a disease\nI rebuilt my city from under the sea\nSo miss me\nWith all of this pity\nI'm busy\nJust give me a second to finally breathe\n\n[Chorus - SOHN]\nCrave is admitted to both\nFlows to the surface\nDon't be a fool\nDon't be a fool\nClimb out the window again\nSlipped on the water\nDon't be a fool\nDon't be a fool\nIf only for justice\nIf only for her\nDon't be a fool\nDon't be a fool\nGive away that card\nAnd take all that I've got\nDon't let me wander\nDon't let me wander\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm feeling this cloudy\nThere's hundreds of Saudis\nInvolved in the bounties\nOf brothers they know that are wrong\nPound me until I move counties\nAnd got them all bouncing to just every one of my songs\nYou know that you broke me right?\nIt took me a decade to fix\nPeddled the butter for every lift\nAnd smiled like a suffering son of a bitch\nJust to run it with bricks\nTied to his legs, his necks and his wrists\nTrying to climb up your chemical cliff\nWithout overdosing on all of your shit\nI was the fool\nYou took me to school\nBut truly I want no revenge\nJust going to pretend\nWe never connected and now it's due time for the end\nAgain\n\n[Outro - SOHN (Wrekonize)]\nIf only for justice\n(Fool)\nIf only for her\n(Fool)\nDon't be a fool\nDon't be a fool\nGive away that card\nAnd take all that I've got\nDon't let me wander\nDon't let me wander", "title": "Fool (WrekMix)", "year": "2014-10-15", "album": null, "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/0a2215213d39bf7349256336a35ac75d.560x558x1.jpg"}]}
