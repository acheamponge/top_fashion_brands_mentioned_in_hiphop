Let me see if I can help you like\u2026 figure 'em out\nHave you listened to Biz Mark's \"Just a Friend\"?\nHave you tried turning me off and back on again?\nIf you Make-A-Wish on a foundation, there's maintenance required\nAll I ask is you be careful when you state what you desire\nThey said Satan is on fire without breaking a sweat\nAll that pagan shit is tired, so I'm taking a rest\nI met my date at the pyre.  She was shorter than I like\nBut wore a dress that's as long as the night.  Then I saw the light\n\n[Hook]\nMAINT REQD, push through the pain\nWhat the flame does not consume consumes the flame\nWe're burnin at both ends, it's safe to assume\nWhat doesn't consume the flame the flame consumes\nMAINT REQD, push through the pain\nWhat the flame does not consume consumes the flame\nBurnin\u2019 at both ends, we're hoping and praying for rain\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, I\u2019d settle on a bed of rusty nails instead of roses\nCause a thorn by any other name is so honest\nSo forth and so what, I got blood on my mattress\nGot a harem full of knife throwers who use my back for target practice\nI fucks with them budget types\nInherited this cutlery along with the scars, and they all look alike\nUsed to write confessions in between the lines\nAnd wear long sleeves so no one else could read my mind\nNow I exercise my right to bear arms when I write words\nThe last polar bear taking a final stand on a melting iceberg\nWhere nothing is exclusive\u2014when holding confidence\nSex could get abusive\u2014but everyone consents\nAnything that\u2019s lucrative\u2014gets reduced to checks\nAnd now you\u2019re wondering where your fair share of the bit of profit is\nSorry kids, the piggy bank's depleted\nHad a million dollar smile, but not the pretty face that\u2019s needed\nI\u2019ve seen toward me, doggy, I\u2019ve never tapped a bottle or twisted the cap whenever they passed the forty\nI\u2019m fat boy disorderly.  Nothing fun about obesity\nBut recently, I toyed with it morbidly\nCordially invite you to the incredible, mind that bends metal\nNo spoon is safe, no fork is too special\nEssentially we all know how the story ends\nHow heavily the plot twist depends on a little bit of\nMaintenance, maintenance, maintenance\n\n[Outro]\nMy house bitches lololololololololol", "album": "Copper Gone"}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
