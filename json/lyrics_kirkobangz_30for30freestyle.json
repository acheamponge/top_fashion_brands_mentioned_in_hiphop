The\nYoung boy got more will than uncle Phil, It's fucked up\nWhen you lose more than you gain in this game\nAnd they talking behind your back while you front the bill\nYeah too many dreams getting killed, too many niggas making it over niggas that's great for real, too many niggas out here thinking that them boys killing me, I'ma eat all them niggas for lunch, then feed they boys to the streets, ain't no more Mr. Niceguy shit, and everybody eats, You've been a student of my style, I just never really wanted to teach\nTired of all these new niggas saying what the city needs, and i'm tired of seeing new bitches saying what they see in me\nAnd lately, I've been feeling like I want a child, girl or boy\nBut I don't ever think I will find a girl for it\nThey say the good things will come to you, boy you gotta wait\nThe restaurant just closed and I still got a empty plate"}]}
