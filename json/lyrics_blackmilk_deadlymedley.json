(Ugh!)\nThis is who you call the truest out the newest fold\n'Til people watching our every move\nLike it's the Truman Show (Ugh!)\nCoolest flow, signal to my crew the cue to go\nWith they finger on triggers, gunpowder under cuticles (Ugh!)\nAnd, newest flow shows as ugly as warzones, yeah\nShit is ugly as Lady Gaga's wardrobes (Ugh!)\nWord to Dilla, his verses iller, the words are killer\nAin't heard nothing this legendary out\nSince the birth of Thriller (Ooh!)\nMy human nature to expose teams seems\nThese rapping niggas are girls, pre-teen Billie Jean\nSeems they love when I'm performing (Ha!)\nThey laugh at your performance (Yeah!)\nMy shit is Martin Luther, your shit is Martin Lawrence (Oh!)\nTouring on a plane in somewhere in the world new\nIn the clouds, listening to Stevie Wonder's \"Girl Blue\"\nSo true, dude is feeling confident and feeling taller\nI'm feeling on top of the world without the fear of falling (Yeah)\n\n[Interlude: Royce da 5'9\"]\nUgh\nUgh\nYeah\n\n[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9\"]\nI said, niggas known to talk a lot get chalked up\nI say I'm sitting in a coffee shop\nI dont mean I'm at no Starbucks\nJust me and Vishis rolling 'round like we don't need no niggas\nJust these triggers; we old school like Dean Pritchard\nYou can't take the heat, get yo' ass out the kitchen\nMatter-fact, take yo' ass back in there and wash the dishes\nI'm ready for war, I know what you're thinking\nI already said it before\nYou better get ready for this deadly medley\nWhenever we here to record (Oh!)\nI can cut into you in my sleep like stepping to the weak\nI can catch a bullet in my teeth (Woo!)\nI'm known as who not to go at, don't ask, just never tempt me\nYou can bet yo' ass you'll have no ass you bet against me\nUgh! I'm in the best shape of my life lyrically\nI don't even write seriously; I just fuck around\nLike a rolling stone, I lay the hat in many homes\nBad boy like Diddy Combs\nShoulders, what his whole entire city on\n\n[Verse 3: Elzhi]\nYo! You need to be amputated (Ugh); I'll snap you in minutes\nI left Detroit rappers in fitteds decapitated\nIt's not a dumb threat 'cause though I'm not what I'll become yet\nI'll challenge some vet and stick it to him like a drum set\nClap the matic; I'll flip like an acrobatic\nSlap fanatics with murderous rap mechanics\nI'm worth pay, pockets go green like it was Earth Day\nThat's why I blow cake like it's my birthday\nThe way I roll: envision a city blob\nHalf of y'all shouldn't rap\nY'all do a shitty job like colon cleansing\nAnd I'm dying to test ya, no denying I'm applying the pressure\nLike the iron I rely on that lie in the dresser (Ugh)\nSeveral try and get they Kangol crushed\nCuz my skills ill like slicing up devil's pie off of angel dust\nYou left behind me looking shadowy, it's fatality\nTo ever try to handle me like a piano key"}], "artist": "Black Milk"}
