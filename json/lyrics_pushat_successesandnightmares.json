Music with the checkered past\nSome said I was finished, checkered flag\nBut like the LVs on this on this checkered bag\nA nigga still play chess on your checkers ass\nYet Sean be youthful, tell Ye \"Stay neutral\"\nWhile the president makes the company fruitful\nI just wanna make my own dark, twisted, beautiful\nGotta factor in the powder under my cuticles\nStill, if you lookin' for real, we don't stop at the yield\nSee, 'cause balling's a sport, take a look at my real\nOne horse on the grill, the other one on the shield\nThat's the 'Rari and Porsche, a quarter short of a mil'\nSee my name on the bill, naked bitch in the pill\nCop some L on the flight, let us smoke it with ills\nThe art of the hustle, still an ultimate thrill\nThe tenure of blowbama's a license to kill, yeah", "year": null}]}
