I wouldn't lie to your face, come and light up a J man!\nSaid I got that whole town to hold down\nWhat we get on; I blow down a whole pound, I know you see me shuttin' shows down\nAnd we pickin' up hoes now. It's goin' down\n\n[Outro]\n-Let 'em know who you be  pimpin'\nIt's Capital STEEZ man\nAk-47, say no more\n-That's what it is, John-John TV in the building?\nI guess so, I mean, shoutout to the homie John-John we just did this show opening up for Mac Miller\nIt's crazy, my biggest performance yet\n-That's real\nIt's world domination"}]}
