We never do listen\n'Less it comes with a 808 (A melody and some hoes)\nPlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)\nLookin' around and all I see\nIs a big crowd that's product of me\nAnd they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream\nYep, her president is black, she black too\nPurple label on her back, but that tab is light blue\nShe take it straight to the head\nThen she look at me, she got ADHD\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nEight doobies to the face, fuck that\n12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that\nTwo pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that\nGot a high tolerance when your age don't exist\n\n[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nLike whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa\n(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)\nWhoa, whoa-whoa\n(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)\nWhoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa\n(They always told me ADHD did it)\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nAnd then she started\u2026\nAnd then she started feelin' herself\nLike no one else in this apartment\n\"Beg your pardon?\" \"Oh, I rap, baby.\"\n\"How old are you?\", She say 22, I say 23\n\"Okay, then we are crack babies.\"\n\"Damn, why you say that?\" She said, \"Where my drink at?\"\n\"I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax.\"\nI stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen; Jumbotron\nMade to the back where she reside\nThen she said, \"Read between the lines.\"\nYep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down\nAnd the fact that she just might open up\nWhen the Nuvo start to drown her body and I know\nThe both of us really deep in the mood now\nIt's nothin' we can do now\nSomebody walked in with a pound of that Bay Area kush\nShe looked at me, then looked at it\nThen she grabbed it, then she said, \"Get it understood.\"\n\"You know why we crack babies?\nBecause we born in the '80s, that ADHD crazy.\"\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nEight doobies to the face, fuck that\n12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that\nTwo pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that\nGot a high tolerance when your age don't exist\n\n[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nLike whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa\n(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)\nWhoa, whoa-whoa\n(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)\nWhoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa\n(They always told me ADHD did it)\n\n[Outro: Ab-Soul]\nYou can have all my shine, I'll give you the light\nDouble cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite\nEcstasy, 'shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like\nYou can have all my shine, I'll give you the light\n\n[Produced by Sounwave]"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
