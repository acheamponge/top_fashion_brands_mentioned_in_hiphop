Termanology. . . J DIlla. \n\nI circulate the papes\nMy mind state concentrate on the paper chase\nWith good rates on the weight no seed or shave\nHennessey to the face don\u2019t need to chase\nMy enemies I erase out my mind frame\nMy style caine on the beat, I step like ten deep\nThat S and then T, don\u2019t sweat the technique\nThat\u2019s me, repping that ST (unh)\nWent on a brief chase, stashing my briefcase\nHash on my weed\u2019s laced, flashing my deep crates\nLike Flex, but I flex album release dates\nSo damage a beat tapes sampling beat breaks\nI check with a weak fake rapper diseased snakes\nThat ran through the beat game, wacker with each tape\nThey try to destroy the game with that noise\nAnd blame the bad boys, like Puff the same choice to suck\nAnd make corny rap with shiny suits for loot\nAnd pollute the booth with that music\nLosin\u2019 the truest of art in confusion\nDo I wanna lie\u2014 or give you the truth\nDo I wanna fry\u2014 or ride in Lex coupes\nLet\u2019s choose.
