(Nope)\nThe game split a long time ago and they can't quit\nBoonk Gang had it figured it out (What's that?)\nWhen he stated that it's a whole lot of motherfuckin' gang shit\n\n[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]\nEverything is active, blame it on the rap shit\nBlame it on every fucking thing but the stacks and the taxes\nDon't huddle up with no squad, might come and kill you, on God\nActive, everything is active\nEverything's a gang, it's a gang and it's ashes to ashes\nDon't huddle up with no squad, might come and kill you, on God\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nWe ain't the only gang members\nIt's still a fight against the black, white, hang genders\nDeep in the south, summer all the way 'til it became winter\nNow the boys in blue, they kill the black cocaine vendors, yeah\nWe ain't the only gang members\nWhite presidents and black leaders were slain, 'member?\nSo watch your back when some wack man attacking the black skin\nAin't no calm or relaxing life when strain hinders, uh\nRepublicans and Democrats in a spat\nSince the 1800's, it's been attacks, then it cracked\nAnd still do, different views will kill you\nThat is fuckin' mildew, they uplift the steel too\nLot of gang shit in Charlottesville\nUnite the Right rally bought a car to kill\nAin't no togetherness\nWhite supremacist and black will fight 'til finished\nBut all their rights diminished without a life replenished (Dead)\nJust like my homeboys\nAll the different groups in life packin' chrome toys\nIf you feel me, holler back\nNow it's gang colors if you wearing a MAGA hat (Word)\n'Cause the message of talking good old days\nUsin' force and more power, you know, them good old ways\nBut I know that flag is serious and if a man tore it\nThat'll be his ass if he kneel and don't stand for it\n\n[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]\nEverything is active, blame it on the rap shit\nBlame it on every fucking thing but the stacks and the taxes\nDon't huddle up with no squad, might come and kill you, on God\nActive, everything is active\nEverything's a gang, it's a gang and it's ashes to ashes\nDon't huddle up with no squad, might come and kill you, on God\n\n[Outro]\nYou know, my brain like, \"I wanna build a spaceship\"\n'Cause man is gonna blow this fucking place up\nThis spaceship has to be massive, it has to be like a football field\nI wanna build a spaceship, maybe like 180 thousand seater\nMaybe we can build something\nMy brain is thinking like, \"Okay, how are we gon' fly away from this motherfucker when it blows up?\"\nCatharsis"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
