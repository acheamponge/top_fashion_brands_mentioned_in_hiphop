I don't know how to act\nWhen you throwin' that back\nI've been sipping' that 'ngac, just a 'lil bit\nYou've got a nice ass, baby, with some lil' hips\nI can't lie, i've been watching with some vigilance\n(I want you)\nFuckin' with some Hennessy, the remedy (Remedy)\nYou say how you want me call it chemistry ([?])\nAnd I buy the drugs and the amenities\nYa you bad and I got a couple felonies\nFuck it up\nI'm a baller, baby, run it up\nHave you ever had a dick from a hustler?\nI got my team, baby, we don't do no huddle up\nMy niggas want a double cup not a cuddle up\nLate night\nGot me feindin' and it ain't right\nI've been tryna get it home, what you taste like? (Taste like)\nFuckin' till the morn' turn to day light\n(Ooh)\nAnd we can make it last if your pace right\n\n[Chorus: Baeza]\nShawty got what i've been looking for\nIt ain't nothin' I wasn't pushin' for\nI want you, I want you, I want you\n\n[Verse 2: Baeza]\n\n[Chorus: Baeza]\nShawty got what i've been looking for\nIt ain't nothin' I wasn't pushin' for\nI want you, I want you, I want you\n\n[Verse 3: Clyde Carson]\n\n[Chorus: Baeza]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/323713c8899725aedb1ea8f82d7ec330.559x559x1.jpg", "year": "2017-07-07", "title": "I Want You", "album": "24"}]}
