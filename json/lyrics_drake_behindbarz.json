That's not true\nWe got ties in West End too\nShe came over and she got slewed\nThrowin' up six like man had flu\nI got way too big off Views\nBack to the basics, I won't lose\nThey wanna link when they got no chunes\nThey too worried 'bout sellin' out shoes\nI don't give a fuck 'bout jeans and crep\nOr goin' to Milan or goin' to the Met\nI just wanna make these songs for the set\nI just wanna load that and let that wet\nI got so much tings in the stash\nFold up anyone, dun that clash\nGot no sense like Jizzle and shh\nBig and bad like leader and shh\nCan't do love 'cause they get too attached\nPhone get broke and whip get scratched\nI'ma just take my knots in cash\nThey can never tie me down, that's facts\nAll that bark but we know he's a cat\nI don't really like goin' tit for tat\nI'ma just come like tat-tat-tat\nI'ma just end that there, that's that"}]}
