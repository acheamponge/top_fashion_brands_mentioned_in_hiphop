Simpson off in a week\nI could show you how to blow up on ya own; in a Benz\nThat hit a buck! and make the windows go up on they own\nWit a stash box compartment for; a handgun\nThat make holes the size of peep holes, on apartment doors\nMy closet look like department stores; and you wonder why\nYa girl's comin home, wit a cigar sent for\nCause I just dump the light Dutch, mash the guts\nYou won't believe how much ass I touch\nWho else struts pass the sluts, and a chain wit so much\nAss and cuts, that it hangs much pass the nuts\nThat's why I get followed by broads; wit deeper throats\nThen the people at the circus, that be swallowin swords\nY'all hopin that the Don fall off; but my money's long enough\nTo keep shootin ya bank until ya arms fall off\nI'm eatin, and I ain't have to use someone's utensils\nAnd when you clean as me, you know that every bum is against you\nBut please don't let someone convince you; to test the kid\nAnd get hit wit slugs as long as a No. 2 Pencil, fucka\n\n[Hook 2 - 2x]", "title": "F You Too"}]}
