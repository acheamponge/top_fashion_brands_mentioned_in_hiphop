{"artist": "Ice-T", "songs": [{"title": "I Love Ladies", "lyrics": "Ya heard the Ice was rockin', ticket sales were high\nBought some fresh Adidas so you could look fly\nBroke out from your crib rushin' to get here\nTripped ans stumbled almost broke your neck comin' down the stairs\nJumped into your ride, pushed the speed to the limit\nJumped out of your car faster than you jumped in it\nNow you're at the jam but in for a shock\nStupid big line wrapped around the block\nThrough the walls of the hall you could hear me rhyme\nMethodically you schemed a way to cut in line\nBut when you got inside the sight straightened your curls\nCause as you look around all you could see were girls\n\nI love ladies\n\nI think it's time that I tell the truth\nI been dissin' females since my early youth\nBut you know that's a drag and there's no doubt\nCause females are the one thing that I can't do without\nFemale companionship is my one vice\nI love to buy the girls things, love to treat em real nice\nHomeboys you must admit the best part of each day\nIs when a beautiful lady comes walkin' your way\nFemales possess that one commodity that no man will ever have\nNot that hangs around me\nThey got it, we want it, they move it, and flaunt it\nThey shake it and sway it, we'll die just to lay it\nWe try to supress it until they undress it\nAnd beg 'em to use it, and cry not to lose it\nNo man can deny it so don't even try it!!!\n\nI love ladies\nLadies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)\nI Love Ladies\nLadies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)\nThat sounds nice (You know we love you Ice!!)\n\nI'm junkie for females and that's a fact\nI'm not into havin' my homeboys rubbin' my back\nDon't dig goin' to the movies alone\nOr talkin' to myself on the telephone\nGoin' to a disco that's packed with men\nThat's like tryin' to get a dance in the federal pen\nWalkin' through a park with a gang of the guys\nAnd a beach full of fellas never opened my eyes\nAnd man if females are one thing that you don't need\nYou better get away from me at a high rate of speed\nCause if you don't like them you must like men\nAnd homeboy that's where our serious problems begin\nBecause to me women are God's true gift\nThere's absolutely no question who I'd rather be with\n\nI love ladies\n\nI seen this fly girl walkin' down the street\nJammin' a box rockin' to the beat\nThe girl looked pretty, she really looked nice\nSo I said to myself she's got to be with the Ice\nWalked over to her, started sayin' my rhyme\nShe said \"Ice you're so bad, you damn near blew my mind\"\nI kept on rappin', runnin' my mouth\nThe next thing I knew I was at her house\nLooked at her closely, said for goodness sake\nThe girl was cut like a diamond, had curves like a snake\nHer top half was heaven, the bottom was the hell\nI knew tonight that the Ice was gonna rock well\nBut then she started talkin' mess about love and romance\nUntil she noticed the bulge growin' in my pants\nYou should'a seen the girl's eyes as my body expanded\nShe grabbed for my leg, raw sex she demanded\nMy knees started knockin', I tried to run\nShe said \"Please don't leave Ice, I want you to come\"\nThis girl meant business I had no doubt\nThis is just about the time that the Ice passed out\nThe next day I woke the girl was through\nRoom still smokin', my legs black and blue\nMy eyes bloodshot, my hair pressed straight\nMy knees still knockin', I knew I lost weight\nShe was the best y'all, yes on this earth\nI would'a paid a million dollars, that's what it was worth\nIf I had got her name or number it would'a been nice\nBut I'm here to let you know the girl went off on the Ice\n\nI love ladies\nLadies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)\nI Love Ladies\nLadies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)\nThat sounds nice (You know we love you Ice!!)\n\nNo when it comes to partyin' the ladies know how\nWhen I ask for a reply they always scream owww!!\nIt's the homeboys always tryin' to act real chill\nSometimes it's jealous MC's mad cause they ain't on the bill\nMaybe they scared if they say ho!\nThey might lose their cool\nBut I got some news for you: a fool's a fool\nBut don't get me wrong, most fellas do rock\nThey put their hands in the air, they take the show to the top\nThey start rockin' with the ladies once the show begins\nThey don't stand lookin' stupid like some mannequins\nThey don't lean against the wall like they're I some trance\nThey did not come with no intention to party or dance\nYou know what? yo dead beats should just stay home\nLeave me, my homeboys, and the ladies alone\n\nWe love ladies", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4087bd0151e7fc336a1bdb7aca3ef257.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Rhyme Pays", "year": "1987-11-14"}]}
