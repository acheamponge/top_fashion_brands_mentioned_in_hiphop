You fell in my trap\n45' by my nuts, I step on my strap\nI'm on Saks Fifth, I got the fifth next to my sack\nYou're only real when it's peace\nYou're a punk when it's war\nIf you ain't scared to wear your chain\nWhat you tucking it for?\nWith knives they don't represent\nI've done it before\nPulling the Tec' out the dresser\nGot the gun in the drawer\nGot your team on zip\nWe coming to score\nCatch him hanging on the corner\nMake him run in the store\nCock it back, point blank, pump one in your jaw\nNow every thing you eat gotta come through a straw\nHustled in a coke spot, we was pumping em' raw\nThe customers used to slide the money under the door\nI knew I could kill this beat, but I wasn't too sure\n[?] convinced me, only did it for my brother-in-law\nRun up on me with a mask\nThen he better be trick-or-treating\nLoose lips sink ships, reason your ships sinking\nNiggas hate me but can't give a legit reason\nThey will never pass me cos' they tryna' get even\nLames wanna talk, fuck a talk, I'm sick of meetings\nI don't wanna talk, when I see you I'm just squeezing\nLeaved you slumped with a shit bag, ya wig leaking\nEvery time you try to take a piss, your dick bleeding\nYou a follower, but you gon' be in a ditch sleeping\nCos' them lame niggas that you follow be misleading\nViolate in the morning, we clapping them this evening\nAdrenaline rush and I feel a pulse in my wrist beating\nNiggas so nosy, when you talk they be lip reading\nDon't stick your two cents in when my clicks speaking\nYou always bigging niggas up, screaming they clique eating\nYou call it giving compliments, I call it dick eating", "year": "2016-06-03"}]}
