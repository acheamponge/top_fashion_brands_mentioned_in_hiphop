I'm the son of song biologically\nThe fatherly artistry fathered me and comfortably\nSaw beyond degrees.  Y'all believe what's too hard to see\nMasters of visions, so my path is to listen\nDon't question my wisdom, I'm origin\u2014ask your religion\n\n[Verse 4 \u2013 Saigon]\nIt's a very beautiful thing when you can bring truth to the light\nSpit hardness and still get the youth to unite\nIt ain't one rapper out now maneuverin\u2019 right\nYour ice is nice, but what you tryna do for the fight?\nYou gon' play pussy or play dog?\nI'mma make the D.J play songs for y\u2019all that made it to the morgue\nYou gotta understand the situation we placed in\nMalcolm got murdered\u2014we never got his replacement\nIt kinda make sense why niggas\u2019ll wet your face in\nFor something as stupid as chasin\u2019 a reputation\nSaigon was gun man, I can bust a sawed-off shotgun with one hand\nGive you a quick suntan\nYea, real recognize real\nAll I recognize when I look in your eyes is the god of the squeal\nSon, I\u2019m ill like the shit MacGyver could build\nTreat you and your troops like the hoop when I deposit the pill\n\n[Hook]\nThe head of state is lyin\u2019\n\u2018Cause the world is multiplyin\u2019\nA hundred men are dying\nMothers home are crying\nFamilies die", "album": "Swizz Beatz Presentz: Abandoned Tracks Vol. 1"}], "artist": "Saigon"}
