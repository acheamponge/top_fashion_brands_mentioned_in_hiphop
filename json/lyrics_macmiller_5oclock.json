I'm a need a recap\nGrab a weed sack chief that 'till my feet flat\nI got this covered like a pro bowl d-back\nBreathe rap and I been known to make the beat clap\nNeed cash so I'm trying to move some trees fast\nTell you where the meat at\nAsk you where the cheese at\nPeople 'round the city see the youngin' and respect the grind\nPutting in the extra time\nGuaranteed next to shine\n\n[Hook]\nSomebody told me sleep was a cousin of death\nAnd following a dollar finds nothing but stress\nA marathon grind like I'm running from rest\nIt's (5 o'clock in the morning)\nSomebody told me sleep was a cousin of death\nAnd following a dollar finds nothing but stress\nBut I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left under my chest\n\n[Verse 2: Boaz]\nI rise before the sun come up and get my day started\nPray to the most high, I roll up my haze and spark it\nAnd then my paper starts to roll in\nMoney in paper bags\nHammers with laser tags\nWe grown men\nOut on the corner 'till the early morn'\nThe blood of a hustler getting mines before I was born\nYou get stormed by these hot ass bars\nFrom me and Easy Mac\nCrusin' in the 'Lac smoking weed with no seeds in that\nThere ain't no reason that these other rappers hatin' on us (why?)\nExcept these labels anticipating and waiting on us\nThey get the BBS's, radios play us\nThen we blaze in the Benz's\nAnd sit this off on BBS's\nAnd from P.A to Texas\nThese niggas know about me\nInternational hustler can't move no snow without me\nOr get no dough without me\nNiggas getting they stacking on\nEarly bird get the worm\nI'm out here at the crack of dawn\n\n[Hook]\nSomebody told me sleep was a cousin of death\nAnd following a dollar finds nothing but stress\nA marathon grind like I'm running from rest\nIt's (5 o'clock in the morning)\nSomebody told me sleep was a cousin of death\nAnd following a dollar finds nothing but stress\nBut I'm going hard 'till there's nothing left under my chest", "year": null, "album": "The High Life", "title": "5 O\u2019Clock"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
