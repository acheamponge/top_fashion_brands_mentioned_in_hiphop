Wait a minute\nGet off me!\n\n[Hook]:\nGirl when you hit the floor\nYou just dance that night like there's no one around\nYou get in your zone\nAnd you just shake it all alone\nLike you don't see nobody else\n\n[Verse One]:\nExcuse me, I saw you\nIt's looking like Mission: Impossible\nDancing like nobody ain't there\nNobody ain't lookin' at you freakin' that chair\nNobody ain't seeing what you doing with that tongue\nI'm trying to be a good Christian hon\nCan I get an amen?\n(AMEN!)\nWhere you at? Be there tomorrow\nMy life intact yo\nBut this ain't tabernacle\nAnd that sure ain't holy water\nYou somebody's daughter\nCall me daddy though\nHere's my e-mail addy yo\nTrying to wind on that body though\nBut it's like nobody can get close\nYou wildin', partyin', eyes closed\nHands up, nobody around in your mind\nGet yours, I'll hold the line\nOne time\n\n[Hook]:\nGirl when you hit the floor\nYou just dance that night like there's no one around\nYou get in your zone\nAnd you just shake it all alone\nLike you don't see nobody else\n\n[Verse Two]:\nYo, look what you doin'\nMy mind is only on (hey now)\nKeep bending over, just don't play now\nTrying to get you to the room and lay down\nSay now, can I dance behind ya?\nHello!\nYo, you hear me talkin'\nDon't front like you don't see me standing in front of you\nNever mind them niggas humpin' you\nI move like Prince, like Mike, like Tito, Jermaine and them\nEver since I could remember\nYou're looking at an honorary Soul Train member\nYo!\nHey girl\nExcuse me\nAnybody tell you that you look like Tutti?\nLet me show you them Facts Of Life\nAnd stop dancing alone all night\n\n[Hook]:\nGirl when you hit the floor\nYou just dance that night like there's no one around\nYou get in your zone\nAnd you just shake it all alone\nLike you don't see nobody else"}], "artist": "Kardinal Offishall"}
