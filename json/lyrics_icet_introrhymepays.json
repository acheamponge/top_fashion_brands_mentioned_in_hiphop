{"artist": "Ice-T", "songs": [{"title": "Intro (Rhyme Pays)", "lyrics": "A child was born in the east one day\nMoved to the west coast after his parents passed away\nNever understood his fascination with rhymes or beats\nIn poetry, he was considered elite\nBecame a young gangster in the streets of L. A\nLost connections with his true roots far away\nBut no matter the job or crime\nHe never lost his hardcore obsession to rhyme\nNew Yorks hip hop movement broke loose\nD. J's cut records, raps had the juice\nSince busting rhymes was his natural thing\nHe was crowned the west coast M. C. King\nBut after his inauguration there was a rush\nOf wack rappers with one intention to crush\nThis master rapper and take his throne\nA simple job, he had no crew, he stood all alone\nAssassins came in groups of one through five\nWith raps no mortal M. C. Could survive\nBut he shoved no mercy, he rapped blood thirsty\nBattlin' from Friday on through to Thursday\nNever losing a bout, never ending in doubt\nEvery confrontation K. O. Knock out!\nOn his never ending journey to the T-O-P\nThe L. A player, M. C. Ice-T", "image": "https://images.genius.com/86b9e63b9a38d5cc3e34cf27569b4d81.300x300x1.jpg", "album": null, "year": null}]}
