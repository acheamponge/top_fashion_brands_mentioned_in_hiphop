I call it dumbin'\nMy nearsighted niggas saw it comin'\nMore stunnin', brand new flows to toy wit'\nNeck flooded on some hurricane Floyd shit\nBack and forth to Saint Croix kid, same plan\nPlayin' Sega Dreamcast to the plain lands, a changed Man\nNiggas don't know, they never will\nAnd if they don't understand then they ain't fam\nSimple as that...\n\nChorus 4x"}], "artist": "Nature"}
