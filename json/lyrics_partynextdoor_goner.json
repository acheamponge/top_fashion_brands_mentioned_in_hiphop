When I was young\nBut a little faith will never fail. It'll get you back on your own\nI'm just a man with million dollar dreams, and not a dollar in my hand\nAnd I'm just a man that has a smile on his face, but his mind's a mystery\n(I got a question)\n\n[Hook:]\nIs there an angle, watching over me?\n'Cause all that I've done, is nothing but run\nAm I a goner?\nAm I a goner?\nAm I a goner?\nAm I a goner?\n\n[Verse:]\nDriving down a broken road\nDrowned in the tears of a hurting man\nNever knew how far I'd go\nBut I know this wasn't part of the plan\n\n[Bridge:]\nHappiness is like a fairytale, my  mama told me.
