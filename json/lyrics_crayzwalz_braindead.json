If you keep falling on your ass like that, you\u2019ll suffer brain damage\n\n[Bridge: C-Rayz Walz]\nAllow me to crush your dreams\nAnd now we may discuss the thing\nGet big, I\u2019ll detach your wig\nCultivate pyramids and build for kids\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nEverything in the cycle, your demonic genre\nWill be clutched by the powerful force of karma\nYou think characters is cool \u2018til they frostbite\nShowing and proving.  A wise fool must knew and lost sight\nHome is where the heart fits\nBelieve in God, but tie your camel before you cross the River Styx\nDance with the wolves.  Don\u2019t scale full moon in your sheep skin\nSpiked, yellow casket dead on the point\u2014sleeping\nFlood the industry and wear these high waters\nGet your potato head bashed, smashed into a side order\nScientific torture.  These black dots\nLittle respect in the white backdrop\u2014Ravipops\nYou blue bloods want to trap me.  Exactly\nIgnorance is bliss\u2014dig this\u2014I ain\u2019t never been happy\nThe gift of the verse, the trick of the curse\u2014watch me carry it\n\u2018Til I go chrome and Swing Low in a Street Chariot\nCarry me home, let Harriet tally my bones\nAnd winter poems, holmes.  Make sure you bury the tome\n\n[Hook 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nBrain!\nBrain dead.  Brain dead, brain dead (You know you)\nBrain dead.  Brain dead, brain (B-b-b)\nBrain dead.  Brain dead, brain dead (We all)\nBrain dead.  Brain dead!\nIf the mood is right and the music\u2019s tight\nIf you use your sight, you won\u2019t lose the fight\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nAccept death as the ultimate consciousness\nI\u2019m confident.  Confusion is bondage, kid\nPhysical chemicals create elegant beams\nThat turn men to mice just to make elephants scream\nAt least my theme\u2019s original!\nBehold the dream of the most seen invisible\nYou a liability.  \u2018Cause of my lie ability, I\u2019m peace\nBut the truth is you an enemy (Enemy)\nCry freedom!  This is hate crime immunity\nBassline in tune with the groove of the community\nAnd you falsehoods never give to ghetto youth\nOn behalf of my A-side, this is what I B/be living through\nGrace and grit.  You exist as a waste of spit\nReshape your greatest light to a ink blot drip\nGet Buzzed like Lightyear peers of infinity\nAnd my walk is much worse than your biochemistry\nYou hold heat?  So?  What we carry\u2019s hotter\nBuck 50 on your head now like Harry Potter\nYou just Spud Webbs playing D on Shaq\nI\u2019m beyond gats and neon plaque\u2014I\u2019m eon fucks\nYou peons, black.  Neo cuts \u201cDegrees\u201d on wack\nI leave y\u2019all stucks to bleed on hacks\nAnd the facts could stack to put me on maps\nYa?  (Ya?).  Tell the streets I done it\nMy speech peach reaching sonic summit\nLines hook\u2014it\u2019s a mind jux.  Exactly\nBesides, you don\u2019t want blood on your khakis\nFrom being\n\n[Hook 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nBrain!\nBrain dead.  Brain dead, brain dead (You know you)\nBrain dead.  Brain dead, brain (B-b-b)\nBrain dead.  Brain dead, brain dead (We all)\nBrain dead.  Brain dead!\nIf the mood is right and the music\u2019s tight\nIf you use your sight, you won\u2019t lose the fight\n\n[Hook 2: C-Rayz Walz] (x4)\nI will kick my feet\nScratch my dick and fix you something to eat"}]}
