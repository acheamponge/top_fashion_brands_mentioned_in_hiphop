Christ paid the price and cost of living like that...\n\n[Chorus]\nCheck the headlines here's the headlines\nJesus is alive that's the headlines\nSo read the headline you'll see the headline\nThey went and beat till he died then he redlined\n\n[Verse 2]\nUntil you know the deal I'm a keep rocking till\nI reflect the light like the forehead of Dr. Phil\nIn Christ my healer paid the doctors bill\nAnd made the sin disappear like David Copperfield\nStop and chill park it while I spark it\nWatch it go down like ya town with the housing market\nThe fields is white so I'm down to harvest\nSo check me out like shopping lines that be down at target\nI don't write like I'm trying just to sound the hardest\nI just try to shine the light right where it's now the darkest\nChrist paid my debt now and that's a promise\nSo keep the stimulus check I ain't counting on it\nAnd when I got to comment on the pain he felt\nIt leaves my brain swimming like the head of Michael Phelps\nJesus came to help w/ the shame we've dealt\nCause broad be the path on the way to hell"}]}
