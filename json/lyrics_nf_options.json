Put a bag in your face\nAnd I put you by the road like, \"Look, we're the same!\"\nHere's a reminder that I still spit\nThink I need to advise you to watch your lip\nOr at least realize that I'm not no kid\nDon't Google my name tryna find my crib\nWrite a pop song, then I write a song like this\nDo a lot wrong? Doesn't matter, I learn quick\nI'm an outlaw, my brain has no fence\nDoesn't matter either way to me 'cause even if it did\nI would destroy it (Woo, woo, woo)\nUsed to be employee, now I'm employer\nMaking big deals, now I gotta get lawyers\nPeople tell me to relax and enjoy it\nBut when I kick back, I see warnings\nSo much time might pass, can't ignore it\nEvery time I rap and I'm recording\nMight be my last so I absorb it 'cause\n\n[Chorus]\nI gotta make it or make it\nI gotta make it or make it, yeah\nI gotta make it or make it\nMan, these are the options, these are the options\nI gotta make it or make it\nI gotta make it or make it, yeah\nI gotta make it or make it\nMan, these are the options, these are the options\nI gotta make it or make it\nI gotta make it or make it, woo\nI gotta make it or make it\nMan, these are the options, these are the options\nI gotta make it or make it\nI gotta make it or make it, woo\nI gotta make it or make it\nMan, these are the options, these are the options (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 2]\nTool bag without the pliers\nIntros without the choirs\nNew car without the tires\nMusic without the writers\nUFC without the fighters\nSmoking without the fire\nCigarettes without the lighter\nAustin Powers, no Michael Myers, that's me\nIf I ain't got the bars, you see\nSomething ain't right like I'm incomplete\nOutcast, yes, I'm a different breed\nIf you disagree, make 'em all retreat\nAct like a boss when I compete\nTake my thoughts into hyperspeed\nWhen it's all gone and I hit my peak\nAt least I'll know that I took that leap\n'Cause life is a process\nAnd I am not here for the nonsense\nLosing everything I worked for likes to weigh on my conscience\nThat why I block out the comments\nWho's next? Who's next?\nI don't know, I ain't been watching\nClosing my ear to the gossip\nI gotta make it or make it\nMan, these are the options, ooh\nNo forfeit, my course different\nChanged flows and I'm bored with it\nMore livid, never more driven, I avoid timid\nTry to tell me I could never be the G.O.A.T. of rap, I ignore limits\nI was born with this, you're trippin' thinkin' I'm slippin'\nI'm enjoying this\nLook at me, I'm on the tour selling more tickets\nEven if the fourth record didn't sell a copy, I'ma do it like a hobby\nI ain't quitting 'til the Lord tell me\n\n[Chorus]\nI gotta make it or make it\nI gotta make it or make it, yeah\nI gotta make it or make it\nMan, these are the options, these are the options\nI gotta make it or make it\nI gotta make it or make it, woo\nI gotta make it or make it\nMan, these are the options, these are the options\nI gotta make it or make it\nI gotta make it or make it, woo\nI gotta make it or make it\nMan, these are the options, these are the options\nI gotta make it or make it\nI gotta make it or make it, woo\nI gotta make it or make it\nMan, these are the options, these are the options\n\n[Outro]\nAyy, these are the options\nAh, these are the options\nWoo, these are the options\nYeah, these are the options"}], "artist": "NF"}
