What's gold and gory\nPull the jury off some dead bitch in a crematory\nPut 12 little faggots in the fucking dirt then crawl\nOut your little girls jaw, and ask her, WHO'S BIZZARE?\nI'm so underground I should seek production in China\nCut a dime in half, I got 2 licks, and one vagina\nFind a therapist that I can eat out soon\nCause I'm so homesick, I miss mom's fallopian tubes\nMy vision is stillframe animation\nPut a gun to a square, make him slice a mason\nPissing at Days Inn, got a dog for an agent\nStudied virtue in the basement where my doctor tried to keep his patients\nPaint a portrait, four minutes, no rush\nWhile fools clock in a circle to dissect the brush\n\n(Chorus) X2\nHalf step? Can't walk\nDrunk slut? Pants off\nFake jack? Can't talk\nThis mic? Hands off\nNew jack? Get taught\nWeak shit? Get caught\nYour crew? Shits off\nWack bitch!\n\n(Copywrite)\nDr. Strange will slop your Range with a stinking bucket of piss\nAnd cockblock your brain if you think you fucking with this\nBy Christ, I'll summon this shit\nSon of a bitch, up in your crib fucking your bitch with one of my fists\nPants sagging low, hand smacking hoes\nGet down with the Klan just to slit the Grand Dragon's throat\nThe way I see, everything on this damn earth is free\nMurder beats, and turn MC's to hamburger meat\nFirst coming of Copywrite, thief with the mic\nCreep like a thief in the night, sneak in your crib, leave with your wife\nRepent for your recordings\nWhen the engineer said your vocals were too hot\nWhat he meant was they were distorted\nExplain how your venom harms your prey, and you're hard to slay\nWhen your DJ's dressing up in women's lingerie\nFor Eons I infect y'all with Agent Orange\nIf you don't know the words to these verses, don't even sing the chorus\n\nChorus X2\n\n(Eon)\nI stay Unbreakable like David Dunn\nThe Philly native son\nYou Mr. Glass on mics\nThe jaded one\nCheck out this ill crew's onslaught\nYour career's a Hot97 afterthought\nIt's not my fault the ass fall in the ?past fought?\nNow who's that kid from Space Mountain?\nLooking like an accountant, highly touted, off and on again\nReally hip hop needs to take 5 like Donovan\nI end my quote nice with bong hits and ??????\nSend me the fuck back to ???????? please\nOr release EC's from the hospital for joint disease\nSee the weasel on Da Vinci's easel\nWith the Mona Lisa oil paintings, shavings and scrapings\nCombined with championship trophy engravings\nClowns rock from foul grounds to out of bounds\nYou couldn't see my ass if I was wearing hospital gowns\n\nChorus X2"}]}
