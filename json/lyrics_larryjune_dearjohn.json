You know who daddy\nI'm the one you listen to when you get all ready\nTo hit that blade, I can be your motivation\nShe came with a fifty, I planned a vacation\nBack on the road, more shows\nNo hoes, couldn't do both\nGotta pick one, I'm gettin' older\nAnd on top of that, man, the game gettin' colder\nSlidin', pull up on my homies\nMy bills gettin' high so I'm settin' bigger goals\nMashin', baby, what's happenin'?\nI pulled up wet in designer fashion, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nYou a good ass bitch\nSo good, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy\nLet's talk, what were we doin'?\nI've been thinkin' 'bout you\nThat was a good ass bitch\nSo good, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy\nLet's talk, what were we doin'?\nI've been thinkin' 'bout you\n\n[Outro]\nI know I be gone all the time and shit\nAlways gotta hit the road\nI don't see you for weeks and shit\nBut you know it's all for the cause\nYou know\nYou still doin' good, straight up\nSock it to me"}], "artist": "Larry June"}
