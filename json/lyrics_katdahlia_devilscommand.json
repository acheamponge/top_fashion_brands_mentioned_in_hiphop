(Yeah)\nSaid he was brave\n\nBut he was too haunted, to ever be saved\nBut I faced you, by myself\nEvery night you, lost a fight to, the stash on your shelf\n\nAnd you'd breathe, evil in and out\nSlowly, awareness is fading out\n\n\n[Chorus]\nHere comes his twisted smile, and that wicked raised eyebrow\nStaring at me, Our legs are falling to the ground\n\nAnd if I try to understand, All the workings of this man\nId be losing every hand, hes at the devils command. (x2)\n\nSaid I would leave him (Yeah)\nBut I would always stay\n\nDidn't have the courage, to leave our love in disarray\nSo i'd face you, by myself. Every night you, lost a fight to, the stash on your shelf\n\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd you'd breathe, evil in and out\nSlowly, our love is fading out\n\nHere comes his twisted smile, and that wicked raised eyebrow\nStaring at me,our legs are falling to the ground\n\nAnd when I try to understand, all the workings of this man\nId be losing every hand, hes at the devils command.
