Who's not?\nBang, new job, who's boss?\n\n[Verse 1: Ghetts]\nSelf-employed wealthy boy\nDealt with pain, dealt with joy\nMe and Wiley are cool now\nBut I'm the same nigga who tried help destroy him\nTell Lorraine, tell McCoy\nI failed again, felt annoyed\nNow I've got paper round\nMe, Daily Star 'cause I sell the voice\nOi, it's the paper boy, I'm in effect\nDon't like me? I've always been a threat\nMy only competition is the man in the mirror\nMy niggas or my silhouette\nThey know I'm a flamethrower\nMake man lay low and lay lower\nAnybody says that they can't get hold of me\nTell them niggas, I'll be on the same blower\nWho am I? The baddest MC that grime ever produced\nThe resident Eskimo goer\nCulture vultures, they owe us\nOh, now they know us?\n\n[Hook: Ghetts]\nBang, same city, new blocks\nBang, boombox on the rooftop\nBang, who's hot? Who's not?\nBang, new job, who's boss?\nBang, same city, new blocks\nBang, boombox on the rooftop\nBang, who's hot? Who's not?\nBang, new job, who's boss?\n\n[Verse 2: Wiley]\n(Bang) I'm hot, so what?\n(Bang) I merk spitters for free, no gwop\n(Bang) And my path is clear, no stops\nGot yards in the sticks, no shops, no cops\n(Bang) Keep my mind on the cash\nI see if I can turn a stack\nI know you love practicin' but\nMe and my niggas were born burnin' tracks\nLike yo, they know I'm a cold spitter\nMind that gyal dere, she's a gold digger\nChattin' 'bout how you didn't know I roll with her\nPush me far, turn to a cold figure\nRespect, you do it, but man have done it\nAnybody from the elite, you know we run it\nHere's what it feels like to win\nGet rewarded, after 100 miles of runnin'\n\n[Hook: Ghetts]\nBang, same city, new blocks\nBang, boombox on the rooftop\nBang, who's hot? Who's not?\nBang, new job, who's boss?\nBang, same city, new blocks\nBang, boombox on the rooftop\nBang, who's hot? Who's not?\nBang, new job, who's boss?\nBang, same city, new blocks\nBang, boombox on the rooftop\nBang, who's hot? Who's not?\nBang, new job, who's boss?\nBang, same city, new blocks\nBang, boombox on the rooftop\nBang, who's hot? Who's not?\nBang, new job, who's boss?\n\n[Verse 3: Ghetts & Wiley]\nGH, and I've been doing this\nSince I had an Ericsson 338\nAnd I have pushed more wigs back\nThan a label has done to an album release date\nIf I send for a MC\nThen man better reply tonight, not a week late\nIf a man can't move on from the war\nRight after it, bro, that's a weak trait\nI'm not a lager lout\nBut I'm still throwin' bars about\nMidday, lookin' for a haircut\nShop's packed, gotta go to the barber's house\nI'm doin' business everyday here\nThat's why I can't mess or laugh about\nWhen it comes to the grime in 2016, rudeboy\nI'm the hardest out\n\n[Hook: Ghetts]\nBang, same city, new blocks\nBang, boombox on the rooftop\nBang, who's hot? Who's not?\nBang, new job, who's boss?\nBang, same city, new blocks\nBang, boombox on the rooftop\nBang, who's hot? Who's not?\nBang, new job, who's boss?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3ce966bb841356a1531adbe75de592e2.600x600x1.jpg", "album": "Godfather", "title": "Bang (feat. Ghetts)"}]}
