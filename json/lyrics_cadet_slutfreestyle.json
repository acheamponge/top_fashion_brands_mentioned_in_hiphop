Happy slap or grab phones and run\nNow I'm making a name on the streets and fam the first time I had sex was peak, buss so quick I didn't know that I beat\nHm, ayo the kid was a neek, what you know about me though?\nI had one message I'd copy and paste to every girl that's on Bebo\nAnd profile pic too man I was wrong, but that's when this shit got long\nIt might sound like I'm going off topic but now I'm gonna tell you how I was a dog\nCos then I went college and I linked up with my boo thing\nAnd I took her off of one lightskin youte, who wouldn't fuck but we'd do things\nAnd I cheated on her, she took me back and then she left me as you do\nYou know if you take a girl from someone, she can get taken from you\nNow these times she's doing her ting but she won't tell me that it's over\nAnd my cousin he pree'd the whole ting but he's moving like it's kosher\nAnd I can't lie, that fucked me up and that might be why I turned cold\nCos she done that monkey bar ting where you swing on but you don't let go\nBut it's all good though\nBut it's on now, *woof* I guess I'm a dog now\nTryna find bitches like a dog pound that will blow me like they wanna get snot out\nI will keep it one hundred with you, ey fam I don't know my body count\nI've had bare exotic tings, even had a mixed race ginger I knocked down\nHow many gyal have I beat now? Lost count, I ain't even talking ucky\nI tossed outside some girls, most man would drop out but I'm tryna buss my ting quick and knock out\nAnd I would rock out, with my cock out, see I was moving scatty\nAnd true say I'd be Cadet Cadet, a lot of these girls would throw pussy at me and yeah I caught it\nDreams that I sold, yeah some of them bought it, but they couldn't afford it\nAnd I ain't even talking about bare abortions, that's a deeper subject don't worry I'll talk it\nThese girls, I wouldn't even have to move up, but I'm still picking them up like an Uber\nI beat one, that chick say I'm a user cos I'd get around the whole team like a rumor\nAnd I remember having gyal on the BB, that said if you don't wanna beat, delete me\nBelieve me, enough of dem girls were freaky, I had girls in sections wanting DP\nNever once did I get an S in TD, I guess I got lucky that my mum is a GP\nSeems B, but they don't give them BD, like they automatically wanna get neeky\nMe I've had girls say that I'm broke, but they've seen what I make in a night\nAnd I've heard that my dick is small, but they still complain I hurt their insides\nAnd I even had girls on Twitter, talking like I ain't got change\nBut the same girl said she'll commit suicide if I don't make time and see her in the day\nSee me, I ain't bought a girl home and my family's thinking I'm nuts, even the last girl I called wifey\nSomething about her I just couldn't trust, I just want the girl I bring home to be the only one that I do\nJust because you might call me a slut, don't mean there ain't shit I ain't been through\nLike, when I got my ex pregnant, been there I woulda had to\nBut her parents are Moroccan, so they just saw me as a black youte\nNow, Alhamdulillah I'm a revert, but no they didn't care about deen\nThey said culture should go with culture, you know? And that's just how shit be\nNow she never told her fam, and I never wanted kids from the start\nBut the fact that I never had a say and that's what really sat on my heart\nLike some real shit, that shit there had me stressing, cos bare people can't have kids in the world\nSo who are we to say no to a blessing?\nUh, and when I think back in the days of course I woulda changed it\nCos I'm lucky I ain't got a BM, like them other youtes that were dressed in the same shit\nUh, and I swear if God gives me a bag of tops, what are they gonna say to my daughter?\nWhen she doesn't know what her daddy was? I mean cuz, see I was nuts, I was out here tryna buss nuts\nI'm thinking of meeting girls for the first time and they got with a man that be fucked\nIt ain't about who you go bed with, it's who's there when you wake up\nBut you ain't gotta take my advice my G cos I'm just Cadet aka the Slut"}]}
