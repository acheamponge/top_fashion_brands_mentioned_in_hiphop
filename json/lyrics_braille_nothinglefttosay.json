Ding a ling\nIs it me or do you see it to?\nI don't play games, I watch DVDs on my ps2\nIf you were in my shoes you would be stressed to\nYou would break down and maybe break through press through\nYes you gotta choose for yourself\nI don't do the right thing cause I have to I do it cause I want to\nWalls I walk through barriers that block you\nI don't care if I'm number one\nDon't care if I'm top two\nMy brain is a mess probably looks like chop sue\n[?] ain't nothing about this life is easy\nI speak with my hands and use them for grindin'\nWrite with my eyes closed music for blind men\nFight with my hands tied kicking and screaming\nLive through a nightmare but keep on dreaming\nI'd rather get the silent treatment\nThen have hateful words spark a violent sequence\nI'm not talking bout the past\nYo these thoughts are recent\nI figured it was time to release them\n\n[Hook]\nThere's really nothing left to say\nYou gonna do what you gonna do\nLive how you wanna live\nThere's really nothing left to say\nNothing left to say\nThere's really nothing left to say\nYou gonna do what you gonna do\nLive how you wanna live\nThere's really nothing left to say\nNothing left to say\n\n[Verse 2]\nI get the last word in\nSign online type my password in\nUpdate my status on the social network\nRock to the beat that's making you neck jerk\nGrind hardcore from my nine to fivers\nMorning and night pull another all nighter\nI get rushed and attacked like a bullfighter\nSoul survivor I don't let go I hold tighter\nWest-sider hear the story from both sides\nBefore you decide the enemy seeks to divide\nWolf in sheep's clothes its only a disguise\nYou gotta speak up yo I can't read your mind\nI can't waste this life I don't got nine\nI'm not feline I feed lines\nInto the veins that's a I V rhyme\nSame mind frame in a different time\nI get surprised when the plans change\nIt's bananas and plantains\nBut I can't panic I got ta maintain\nThey lookin at me\nLike I lost my mind or I'm totally insane\nThey probably right it's my problem though\nGod is sovereign so I'm standing on a solid rock\nRollin down the block knowing\nAfter the storm comes the rainbow with a pile of gold\n\n[Hook]\nThere's really nothing left to say\nYou gonna do what you gonna do\nLive how you wanna live\nThere's really nothing left to say\nNothing left to say\nThere's really nothing left to say\nYou gonna do what you gonna do\nLive how you wanna live\nThere's really nothing left to say\nNothing left to say\n\n[Outro]\nNothing left to say (x8)", "year": "2010-04-27", "album": "Weapon Aid"}], "artist": "Braille"}
