Booker]\nMy step-dad never liked me, tried to turn my mom's against me\nWhen I found that out, feel like I had the laws against me\nSo I went to my room, packed up my things and burnt quickly\nNever have I ever, seen myself move so swiftly\nA few months passed, the house is different since I'm gone\nWhen I pick up the phone, it's mom's ready for me to come back home\nOnly 17, my girl a few years older\nBoth of us young, dealing with these burdens on our shoulders\nIt's been damn near a year, and life's got cold\nFucking my lady with no rubber, now her stomach's on swoll\nSeems like this life I love, has been fucked up since day one\nNow on August 24th, I'm expecting a son\nMy first thought was a baby, gon hit you where it hurt\nThe first thought of making fast money, was snatching a purse\nSo that night I dressed up in all black, and did that\nDid the crime one deep, cause on yourself you can't rat\nQuit school, and on the football team gave up my spot\nAnd took somebody's starting position, hustling on the block\nWith the thousands I won for, had to do the do\nBought three pounds from my ese partna, and he fronted me two\nNow I'm hustling full time, with my mind on my ends\nMe and my boo and a soldier, that she carries within\nThree days straight sometimes, a week hustling away from home\nBaby mama's alone, stressed I'm always gone\nBut when a nigga finally did, make it back to the pad\nI walked up to hug and kiss her, cause I knew she was mad\n\n[Yung Ro]\nI done got to the point, where shit don't even affect me no mo'\nI use to be a bi-polar child, back in 1994\nBut time passed mo' problems, and a nigga still standing\nAfter being abused neglected, depressed and abandoned\nI was stranded, a live walking loose canon\nI use tp pray for the pain to stop, now I only pray for understanding\nI'm on some fo' foot prince shit, but it's only been two half my quest\nI ain't got time to rest, I'm still here so I know I'm blessed\nBut I can't help to think about, the ones I love who so selfish\nAnd when they need somebody to talk to, they run to Ro so helpless\nAnd I would go breathless, and hang myself from a tree\nBefore I do the thangs to y'all, that y'all niggas done done to me\nBut nigga fuck it, who said life was 'spose to be fun\nA bigger heart than a brain, that's the life of the chosen one\nMy girl say I worry too much, and I'm always stressing\nI swear I seen the pain in her face, when I was gone off X\nAnd I love nobody, because nobody love Ro\nAnd it's M-O-B, with my and my big bro\nAnd you down for life, when you fucking with Yung Ro\nBecause I'll hit a nigga I love, before a nigga I don't know\nAnd ask for a hoe, she gon get that do'\nOr make herself useful, and drive my click to a show\nSee I could be a pimp, with some thangs that I say to women\nBut past relationships, got me thinking that I ain't made for women\nI'm a walking mess, full of pain inside\nCatch myself staring at kids, seeing a part of me that died\nSomebody shed a tear for me, cause I ain't got no mo'\nPut too much trust in my niggas, and bad run-in's with hoes\nIt never fails money and pussy, will help you see the truth\nYou wanna see how real your niggas is, then introduce these two\nI put that on my T. Lady, I'm a real living witness\nBut I'm tired of talking to y'all, so get the fuck out my bidness", "title": "Pain & Depression"}]}
