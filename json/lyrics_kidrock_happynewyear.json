Where\u2019s my car keys?\nMy place ain\u2019t too far, we can crawl on our knees\nWhat we\u2019re feeling we can\u2019t do here\nSexual healing Happy New Year\nI know your thinking I must be crazy\nDon\u2019t sweat that small stuff, kiss me baby\nYeah it\u2019s September, but with you here\nEvery night is a Happy New Year\n\n[Chorus]"}]}
