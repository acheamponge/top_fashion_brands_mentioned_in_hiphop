I bet it taste good.\"\nI be cooling out on Slauson, I bet it taste hood\nGot me like, \"Yeah, I'm Gucci, Ferragamo and Louis.\"\nNo department stores I'm in boutiques\nIf it ain't high class, it don't suit me\nGot that bubblicious, that chewy\nMake your man act like a groupie\nYou like fruit? Then imagine I'm smoothie\nPussy monster, give me that Tunechi\nSaid he wanna blow fish, I'm hootie\nFollow my legs to my booty\nSelf sufficient I do me, broke hoes think I'm bougie\nMoody? Who me?\nWild and unruly\nSo I drop the top on that two-seat while his tongue roll on my tootsie\n\n[Hook]\nI'm looking up North while you touching down South (mwah)\nI'm saying where I want it so you takin' it out\nI'm looking up North while you touching down South (mwah)\nI'm saying where I want it so you takin' it out\nKeep on going, going, going, going, going down South\nI'm going, going, going, going, go and kiss that mouth\nKeep on going, going, going, going, going down South\nI'm going, going, going, going, go and kiss that mouth\n\n[Bridge]\nKiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...\nKiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...\nKiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...\nKiss that, mwah, mwah, mwah...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/122cb5a8d88b89ac2c08aedadb152d20.1000x1000x1.png", "album": "TrapGold", "year": "2012-10-11"}]}
