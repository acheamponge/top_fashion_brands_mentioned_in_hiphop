Call me FRANCOIS\n\n(Hook)\nCall Me Francois (call call call me francois)\n(Call call call me francois)\n\nTake what you can; leave what you must\nBecause y'all comin with us, (motherfucker you comin with us)\n\nFill your bags with the rags that you wear and their necessities\nAlong with the dog-tags and family recipes\nRest in peace, if you arrest the pace, movin haste\nGod-speed you black empress, get dressed, we're late\nShe painted my head orange, carved my face with her tongue\nEmptied out my insides and lit the candle behind my eyes\nHad the strike of twelve to midnight, winter queen\nLeft with my life rival in a white limousine\nWhen he made her dress twirl, it looked like a mushroom cloud\nEverybody ducked down except for me, that's my destiny\nHe used a broken condom as a corsage\nI watched him push the rusty pin through her prom dress into her heart\nKill me already; fill me with confetti\nCrush me up and sprinkle me over their wedding and her pregnant belly\nI wasn't ready to suppress these memories, undress the mammaries\nForget the family, streamline the enemy, design the penalty\nCruel and unusual, commit the felony, unfit for prison duty\nNo man's an Island, except for Island man; he's a ROCK STAR!\nNo man's an Island, except for Island man; he's a ROCK!\n\n(Hook)", "album": "Human the Death Dance"}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
