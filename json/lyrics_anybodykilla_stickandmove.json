That's what I'm talkin' about\nStick and move like a heavyweight knockin' you out\nWhat you thinkin' about, when you runnin' your mouth\nTellin' people that you know me like you live in my house\nThings like that, I won't take\nI'ma grown ass man, ya best get that straight\nAll I do is roll state to state\nSo I can look into the eyes of those who relate\nSo if you comin' with me then let's go\nWe gonna make it more hype than the night befo'\nJust a bit more out of control\nSo learn to live a little and watch your life grow\nDon't mean to steer you wrong\nBut when you're livin' in the ghetto, life don't seem long\nStick and move, move and stick\nCause second chances don't come that quick\n\n[Hook]\nStick and move, stick and move\nStick and move, left to right\nStick and move, stick and move\nPack it up, pack it up, pack it up, pack it up\nStick and move, stick and move\nStick and move, left to right\nStick and move, stick and move\nStick and move, don't let no one get ya\n\n[Syn]\nCome stick and move with me\nRight through the industry\nCome stick and move with me\nStick and move\nStick and move\n\n[Verse 3]\nLet's say this was a game of tag\nWill ya hide and go get whatever made ya mad?\nI see you, can you see me?\nEven though I stick and move through the industry\nSkip back, play it again\nWe should all represent our race\nOpen your eyes, cause what you want\nIs staring you right in your face\n\n[Hook]\nStick and move, stick and move\nStick and move, left to right\nStick and move, stick and move\nPack it up, pack it up, pack it up, pack it up\nStick and move, stick and move\nStick and move, left to right\nStick and move, stick and move\nStick and move, don't let no one get ya", "year": "2004-07-27"}]}
