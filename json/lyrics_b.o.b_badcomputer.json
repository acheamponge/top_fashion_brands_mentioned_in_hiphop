Why?\"\nNiggas is still (conscious), waiting for politicians to admit that they lied\nSince we all comrades, (let them niggas pre-locked up in them contracts)\nYou accept that its generous, just 'cause the man let his boot off your neck just a little bit\nIf that shit - if that shit - if that shit was threatening, you wouldn't know that it did exist\nThey wouldn't - they wouldn't - they would've hid that shit from you, like all of your history\nThey brought - they brought - they brought Bill Nye back from the dead just to get at me\nThey sent so many agents my way, I could start an agency\n(You are nearly conscious)\nIt's all about branding, all about branding, feel like a fraternity, niggas wanna brand me\nNiggas want Grammys, niggas want families, niggas think I'm crazy, I don't own a damn thing\nWhere the fuck's the manual? They can't understand me, they can't understand me\nAll that shit must go, all that shit is trash, there is not a Plan B\n(You are nearly conscious)\nWhere do all of that go, where we gon' end up, where we all landing?\nThis is just a shit-show, this is just a Citgo, I am only passing\n(You are nearly conscious)\n\n[Chorus]\nI've traveled so far\nCouldn't tell you how far\nFeels as though I have been\nA million places at once\nMany lives I have lived\nMany battles I've fought\nI've fought, and lost\nIf you're looking for trouble\nYou ain't gotta look far\nWithout the presence of dark\nWouldn't be any stars\nYou may know who I am\nBut do you know who you are?\n(You are, you are)\nThese roads, they don't go nowhere\nThese highways are a dead end\nI've had my share of losses\nI've had my share of lessons\nAnd I sure know what hell is\nAnd I ask you this question\nIf we, ourselves, ain't perfect\nThen how could we know what heaven is like?", "title": "Bad Computer", "album": "NAGA", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a0370f3b55eb19a51f991675764cc669.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
