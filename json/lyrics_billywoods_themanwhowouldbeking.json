Walk like Quetzalcoatl amongst the conquered\nDick hard. Put myself in the stars\nThis woman in the dirt, face down, ass up, doing God\u2019s work\nGo native, the world is yours. (It\u2019s mine, it\u2019s mine, it\u2019s mine)\nThe sound of Maxim guns still sends a chill up my spine\nEmpire of the Sun never sets, a Christian\u2019s duty is never done\nYou can bet on significant returns to all shareholders\nKing Solomon's mines, just give me a hundred experienced soldiers\nThe knowledge of good and evil, sweet nothings whispered by cobras\nUseless baubles given to greedy chiefs\nLies told with the practiced ease of an old thief\nWhen they hung the poor nigga, I felt a certain relief\n\n(No time for discretion...[yelling] I think I'm gonna run out of bullets before they run out of spears.)\n\nTake up your burden, the savage wars of peace;\nFill full the mouth of famine and bid the sickness cease;\nAnd when your goal is nearest, the end for others sought\nWatch sloth and heathen folly bring all your hopes to nought\n\nGold ill-gotten with guts and gleaming Martini-Henry Guns\nWith that holy trinity, who can argue my divinity under two red suns\nReturn like Kipling\u2019s dead son, summoned by monkey paw\nA thousand Philistines slain with a donkey\u2019s jaw\nGave them the rule of law, schools, roles, jobs, clothes and shod\nStill, they fled to the land of Nod\nEden\u2019s East, upon his brow mark of the Beast\nEmpire fat like a cow slaughtered for the feast\nThe stink of a jackal\u2019s teeth\nThe gears of war get greased, ground \u2018em down to raw meat\nWhites of the eyes, limpet mines\nAn Apartheid of the mind, Brittania\u2019s corpse exhumed\nHangnail still growing, Dr. Livingston I presume\nBlood river still flowing\nThe forest inexorably growing as Kinshasa crumbles\nThe dreams of Romans drowned out by Nyiragongo's rumble\n\nTake up your burden, the savage wars of peace;\nFill full the mouth of famine and bid the sickness cease;\nAnd when your goal is nearest, the end for others sought\nWatch sloth and heathen folly bring all your hopes to nought"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
