It's funny...\nEmo and NY's an anagram for money\nRip veins for old friends\nPicked, seen through no lens\nClap for me or at me dog or the show ends\nLive slow to be old men\nI ain't trying to stop in a maze\nWhen hands on the clock move like helicopter blades\nIf I don't wake up tomorrow I'm living through kids rewinding the past\nAnd you can take from you want from what I'll ever have\n\n[Hook]"}]}
