Uh, uh.  My best friend is music, man.  Can\u2019t never go wrong with music, B.  Uh.  As long as you reflect your surroundings and what it means to you (Uh huh), people\u2019ll love you.  See?\n\n[Verse 1: AKIR]\nYo, survival is a gamble, so I\u2019ll bet my life on\nA scramble, refuse to take the role of a sambo watching\nNiggas get trampled, cops playing they\u2019re Rambo\nHandle my position like a nigga out of prison, see\nThe world into shambles like a gun spitting in a crowd\nSubtle, I\u2019ll move humble, though my effect is loud\nTrouble?  I\u2019ll use muscle.  My teacher\u2019s well-endowed\nSwitching style, math for the street, science to teach a child\nAnd my alliance is among the most defying.  I ain\u2019t\nLying, I ain\u2019t eyeing.  My people headed to Zion in a\nBenz tinted\u2014can\u2019t see through the percentage on a\nRoad to riches.  Won\u2019t stop until we finish\nExhibit the skills and do it and spit it like boundless fluid\nDrink it up\u2014it\u2019s therapeutic, it burns, but you\u2019ll get used to it\nI\u2019ll hold my head so I don\u2019t lose it.  And pain is\nFar, pursuing, but, close to me, my best friend is always music\n\n[Hook: AKIR] (x4)\nAyyo, my best friend is music, the sheets are the street\nThe pen is my game and the beat is my heat (This is real life music)\n\n[Verse 2: AKIR]\nUh, scripts I\u2019ll flip expose the shift that con-\n-tradicts our chosen gifts.  Emcees, hold your shit\nThere\u2019s little seeds that live and breathe, grow up and\nBelieve in what you preach on your latest CD.  If it ain\u2019t\nReal, then it ain\u2019t right.  There\u2019s no appeal and\nYou ain\u2019t tight.  The smoothest takeover that you ever\nSeen in your life.  It\u2019s over, soldier.  You sold\nYour soul to a cobra playing Poker with Jehovah\nTo get closer to an extra breath hit, was it worth the effort?\nIn current depth, which means you turn to step and fetch it.  Chained\nTo a platinum plaque, but your LP\u2019s wack.  You can\u2019t\nGo forward, nigga, without giving back, and so\nMy best friend is music and these sheets are the street\nThe pen is my game and the beat is my heat\nSo this is real life music, pump like the heartbeat\nLike my niggas\u2019 footsteps on the concrete\n\n[Hook: AKIR] (x4)\nAyyo, my best friend is music, the sheets are the street\nThe pen is my game and the beat is my heat (This is real life music)\n\n[Outro: AKIR]\nYo, this is real life.  Nah\u2019mean?  We gon\u2019 take it back to the essence of what it means to really be an emcee and reflect the things around you.  There\u2019s trials and tribulations out there that could be focused on.  And these everyday struggles that this common man that buys your cassette, CD, record has to listen to to help him through his journeys in life.  Figure out what your plan is, man, and focus, get back to where you come from.
