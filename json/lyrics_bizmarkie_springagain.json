BECAUSE..\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three]\nNow fellas - have you ever met a girl that tried to front\nAnd wanted you to act like you was on a hunt\nI used to see my homeboys frown and fret\nFor a girl that always tryin to play hard to get\nI know I caught it myself, I must admit\nAnd said - anything you want you gotta work hard for it\nMe the Diabolical, be obsessed?\nAnd go after somethin that a girl posess?\nThey're really on yours like a pair of drawers\nThey want you to be like Santa Claus\nThey want drug dealers, and four-wheelers\nTruck jewelry, they expect you to steal her\nSheeeeit, I know they must be buggin\nThey better hit the streets and do their own muggin\nBut in this case, you would just overlook her\nSend her on her way and say I can't help you hooker\n\n[Chorus]\n\n{*Cool V scratches to the end*}"}], "artist": "Biz Markie"}
