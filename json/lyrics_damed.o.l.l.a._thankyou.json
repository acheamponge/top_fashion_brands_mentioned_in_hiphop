Doing fine?\nWhat yo little ass know about grind?\nYou make money at night but with the son you gon' really shine\nYou gon' get rich just rich for time\nYou start selling with the mess, you coming down mixed up\nInterrogations, that's when your friends gon' switch up\nIf you Kobe, why deal with the ground beef?\nThat's a problem on the street, just ask dudes, everybody\nYou ain't make that team, but can't hate it\nWe all learn from that, then little Shad made it\nZach is still scrambling, Dre is still stacking\nDerek fixing the whips and Ralph making it happen\nThe boat going down with the captain\nLead by example they really watching your actions\nConversations with my girlfriend yeah\nThem talks saved me man, I hella love her\n\n[Hook]\nSay your prayers, be for real\nYou know I miss a part of you, keep your head up\nYou know I'm watching over you in the sunshine\nYou know I'm watching over you in the sunshine\nI want you to be a man, stay true\nDon't let nobody get over you, be for real\nYou know I'm watching over you in the sunshine\nI'm watching over you in the sunshine\n\n[Verse 3]\nTo the villains that raised me little knucklehead\nI ain't got nowhere to go that was enough said\nIt was chili, spaghetti, pasta, and ribs\nEverybody got their plate but that ain't chip in\nWhen it was Christmas, a man put my name in a hat, made me feel a part of something, I was thankful for that\nWhen it was late you tell me, I knew where the blankets was at\nIt mean that you got right to the back\nI be like, \"Hey it's me\"\nWhen I came in hella lit and nobody ever understood what Abby said\nBut you always felt the love and just nod your head\nBelieve the greasy, you always said\nYou cosign with that\nAnd when the heater broke, he left the stove on that mat\nYou always kept it 100 I was on my hype\nYou left the door unlocked and it saved me life\n\n[Hook]\nSay your prayers, be for real\nYou know I miss a part of you, keep your head up\nYou know I'm watching over you in the sunshine\nYou know I'm watching over you in the sunshine\nI want you to be a man, stay true\nDon't let nobody get over you, be for real\nYou know I'm watching over you in the sunshine\nI'm watching over you in the sunshine\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou original Clarence Street, nobody can compare\nUsed to make us drop down and say the Lords prayer, became the routine we did it when you wasn't there\nI quit football, you told me \"Show 'em you ain't scared\"\nGave me that inner faith, gave me nothin' to fear\nThen I went and got Defensive Player of the Year\n\"Treat people how you wanna be treated,\" that was your slogan\nI love that wrestling and you bought me that Hulk Hogan\nStill watching people kids, still cooking dinner\nFoundation strong 'cause it's you that's in the center\nToo many acts of kindness you doin' with no agenda\nHalf blinded, one eye with a great set of antennas\nTold me I could probably catch a fish with yo hook hat\nDrink some alcohol you was telling me I look dead\nI was in the wrong you said you wouldn't tell my mama\nAin't nothin' like a person that can always keep a promise\n\n[Hook]\nSay your prayers, be for real\nYou know I miss a part of you, keep your head up\nYou know I'm watching over you in the sunshine\nYou know I'm watching over you in the sunshine\nI want you to be a man, stay true\nDon't let nobody get over you, be for real\nYou know I'm watching over you in the sunshine\nI'm watching over you in the sunshine", "year": "2016-10-21"}], "artist": "Dame D.O.L.L.A."}
