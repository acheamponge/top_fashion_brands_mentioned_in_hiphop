{"songs": [{"title": "My Name Is Young", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWell my name is Young MC and I'm cold rockin' the house\nI came up into the place and I'm a-turnin' it out\nCause I'm a mover, a shaker, for real and not a faker\nPut your girl up into my face and if you diss me I will take her\nCause I'm one of a kind, I'm going to rock the Earth\nAnd I'm worth my weight in gold, gold in weight my worth\nNot Doug E., Run, Whodini, Cool J, or Shan\nMy name is Marvin, Young MC, and I'm a hell of a man\nI got my name well known all over the place\nTo all seven continents and even outer space\nCause when they're flyin' in a plane or goin' out for a walk\nYeah frontin' people listen when they hear me talk\nThey told me time will tell, and it has told\nCause I've been rockin' a microphone since I was ten years old\nI'm a jack of all trades, and a master of three:\nRockin' the tables, rockin' the mics, and rockin' the young ladies\nSo then yes indeed, give you what you need\nWithout crack, marijuana, cocaine, or speed\nI don't drink or smoke, and that ain't no joke\nI just pick up the microphone and start to go for broke\nSo if you think that you can deal\nGet on the mic, get on the wheels of steel\nAnd then do your thing, or make the telephone ring\nCause if you dance then dance, and if you sing then sing\nBecause once I start there ain't no stoppin\nHeard of hiphop, Young MC is hiphoppin\nMix, scratch, and blend every now and then\nAnd I love to rock the mic when I'm around my friends\nI like to go for broke cause I'm that kind of man\nYo I'm a die-hard rapper, you're my die-hard fan\nSo in closing, I'd like to thank everyone\nBut don't touch that dial, because my rhyme ain't done\nMy name is Young\n\n[Hook]\n(Who is it?)\n(What did you say your name was?)\nMy name is Young\n(Who is it?)\n(What did you say your name was?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow they call me Young MC cause I was young when I started\nPeople tried to break, yo that's cold-hearted\nRock the mic on every chance I get\nThat's why I'm making more money than the national debt\nSee I came into the place to make my name known\nAs the Commander In Chief of the microphone\nThey thought I was wack at first, but once I started to rhyme\nThey said I'm called Young MC, let's hear that one more time\nI take the bull by the horn when opportunity knocks\nAnd I'm notoriously known as the kid that rocks\nSo listen to me, don't say boo me, you don't like me you can sue me\nBut once I'm finished rapping you'll be happy that you knew me\nYou hear just what I'm saying, see where I am at\nCause I'm the freshest rapper out, it is as simple as that\nYo I'm the freshest rapper out, there's not much more I can say\nI put the cap in Cap'n Crunch, the oil in Oil of Olay\nI put the good in Good N Plenty, bad in Bad News Bears\nI put the jack in Jackson 5, the son in Sonny and Cher\nI put the mutt in Mother Goose, the doc in Doctor Seuss\nSo when I'm mic'in' upon the mic you know you gotta get loose\nMy name is Young\n\n[Hook]\n(Who is it?)\n(What did you say your name was?)\nMy name is Young\n(Who is it?)\n(What did you say your name was?)\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou see I rhyme real fast 'cause I am on the go\nFederal Express called up my agent but I said no\nMoney-makin' Manhattan is the place where I went into school\nGoin' into class every day, followin' the golden rule\nI'm takin' it out of the class, I'm steppin' it on the train\nAnd some of the people that you see, they really can make someone go insane\nI'm takin' the bus out to Hollis and in Queensville\nI'm hangin' it down with the fellas, hope I don't get ill\nBecause I'm rockin' upon the mic, and really doin' the best I can\nStayin' with all the ladies, with a microphone in my hand\nMakin' up all the money, and just takin' up all the time\nBecause the Young MC is my name and yo I'm ready to bust a rhyme\nSo when I'm checkin' the party people there's a story to tell\nIt isn't about Humpty Dumpty or the farmer and the dell\nIt isn't about Pinnochio or Alice in Wonderland\nIt's all about the funky rapper who's the greatest man\nMy name is Young\n\n[Hook]\n(Who is it?)\n(What did you say your name was?)\nMy name is Young\n(Who is it?)\n(What did you say your name was?)", "album": "Stone Cold Rhymin\u2019", "year": "1989-09-05", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7e9ff08751b8e32d468ac9e4127b8bec.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young MC"}
