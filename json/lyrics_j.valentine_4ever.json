Valentine Talking]\n\nBaby, whatever happened before me - none of that matters\nCause a real man is looking at your future\nAnd a sucker is always looking at your past\n\n[Verse One]\n\nYou ain't gotta tell me lies\nGirl, if your number's high\nEven if I know, I'm man enough to put that aside\nAll my boys gon' trip, cause this ain't what I do\nI don't give a damn\nGirl, you're way too much to lose\n\n[Bridge]\n\nHe can be a baseball player\nStart for the Lakers\nD Boy from the string\nHave two or three degrees\nWhat that got to do with you and me?\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI could give a fuck about your first\nIma be your last\nBaby, I'm your future, give a fuck about your past\nWe forever, ever, ever\nWe gon' be forever, babe\nAll he ever saw was the things you used to do\nI ain't like them niggas, Ima treat you brand new\nThis forever, ever, ever\nWe gon' be forever, baby\n\n[Verse Two]\n\nYou can call me Captain, but I need saving too\nI done my dirt so what I look like judging you?\nWould I look like holding hangs with ya?\nWould I look like spending grands on ya?\nGirl, I'm sitting up in them stands for ya\nCause I'm such a damn fan for you\n\n[Bridge]\n\nHe can be a rapper or a singer\nRide the bench for the Raiders\nHe could be a movie star, drive a fancy car\nThat ain't gonna affect who we are\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Breakdown]\n\nThey say I'm wrong, but you my right\nDon't apologize for living your life\nIf you're tired of playing these silly games\nThen put your hands up and let me hear you say\nI'm gon' love you, I'm gon' love you\nI don't care if they know you\nI'm gon' kiss you, I'm gon' kiss you\nIma give you what you been missing\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]"}], "artist": "J.
