(Migos-Migos-Migos)\nA billion streams on Vevo bringin' about as much chips as you can get in a quarter bag of Doritos\nB-G, I'm a knockie fan\nI hit you wit' one of these combinations, I'm goin' through complications\nAnd then I do my Tekashi dance\nShmurda was the case that they gave me\nDear God, it's me and little Layzie\nWe was robbin' niggas without no father figures\nAnd that's the way that Wish got shot by Krayzie, it's karma, niggas\nI put you in garage mode, mobster, the shots fly\nThese niggas don't want no smoke, I give 'em carbon monoxide\nLet me hit you with this LOX line, Pac sign\nNo one can do it better, that's a Doc rhyme\nCrush your windpipe, slice you with doxprime\nThat's over your head, as your wife\nThis precious metal, hit her with this lead pipe\nSmile, bitch, you livin' your best life\nO-R-T, let me be brief before my dick speak\nSocks on, break your iPhone so I could go to sleep\nLoad the clip, pop it in, cock it back, ride around the block\nThese niggas call me O.G\nBitch, you as old as me\nLight-speed, I.G., trolls, they don't like me\nSo I scroll through they page, take cliffnotes, and give 'em that Chris Lightly\n\n[Break]\nCome down off the ledge\nTalk to me Chris, don't jump!\nDon't-don't-don't-oh, God!\nYou little niggas don't know who y'all fuckin' with (Fuckin' with)\nOh, it's on\n\n[Chorus]\nShmurda was the case that they gave me (They gave me-they gave me-they gave me)\nShmurda was the case that they gave me (They gave me-they gave me-they gave me)\n\n[Verse 2]\nBattle rap, I'm the answer\nI'm blacker than Jack Panda\nIt's magic 'cause I'm a savage that's twenty-one\nGod damn, I'm a fuckin' gun\nPublic enemy number one, I'm lawless\nWord to Flesh-N-Bone let's get carnarvorous\nThe AK-47 with the cartridges\nBanana spit split personalities, both reflections\nMy third eye is a narcissist\nThe pen dipped in black void\nWi-Fi for y'all, bitch\nI'm rappin' with my eyes closed 'cause I don't need my consciousness\nTriple meanings? I crafted it, mastered it\nAfter this, plaster this all over the visual adages\nImagine if the Gram was only a portion of the passages\nAnd then if you look at the two, see the move? Infinite math, bitch, Oooh, oooh (Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh)\n\n[Break]\nStop-stop the track, let me talk to these niggas, let me talk to these niggas\nCars, dash, ion, the smashness\nThis before the pit\nI speak to Kim as a Mastif right before the movie\nMake me classless to the masses\nI gotta tell my daughters that cha ass ain't cha access\nMy people seen the lowest of the evils\nI got a secret\nEvery dog scared of mama who mama Mama Madea\nCock-ca-cock-ca-cock back and Shaqisha\nSmell it, reverse the science and body it, make it ether\nTime's up, timecode\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, I'm in effect\nJust a fixation, call me J Newt, Oliver Beck\n\n[Chorus]\nShmurda was the case that they gave me (They gave me-they gave me-they gave me)\nShmurda was the case that they gave me (They gave me-they gave me-they gave me)\nShmurda was the case that they gave me (They gave me-they gave me-they gave me)\nShmurda was the case that they gave me (They gave me-they gave me-they gave me)\nShmurda was the case that they gave me (They gave me-they gave me-they gave me)"}], "artist": "Bizzy Bone"}
