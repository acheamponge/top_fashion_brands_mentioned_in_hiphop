Fans keep trying to guess it\nMy record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it\nBoi-1da and Drake if it's beef I address it\nAnd the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit\nBoth of the deals, nothin' under a mill\nWe know you got it to give and we trying to collect it\nLong as I got me some heat through the winter\nDrake known as a pro, I'ma teach you beginners\n'Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer\nFor features, y'all better get me while it's cheaper than dinner\n'Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl\nIf you see her tell this nigga got some beats Imma send her\n\n[Chorus]\nStance on lean, leg up on the wall\nMy niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball\nI'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all\nYou waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall\nBut uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do\nDo's what you do, I do what I do\nStance on lean, leg up on the wall\nMy niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball\nI'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all\nYou waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall\nBut uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do\nDo's what you do, I do what I do\n\n[Verse 2]\nCheck, the verses I'm writin', you might wanna learn it\nYou hatin' my song but your wife wanna burn it\nSo now you at the store for some blank CDs\nYou can't see me, for your sake, might wanna return it\n'Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl\nShe'll forget you and I'll be the only one she concerned with\nTo the people that ignored me before this\nThis one is for you as a song re-recorded\nFunny thing is, you just notice me now\nBut I was here along, your vision's just been distorted\nI'm so throwed, wilin' in this, you ask me what the business is\nAnd I'll write a sixteen and record it\nThe waiting is over I think music needed\nDrake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded\nPeople in the South want it chopped and screwed\nI got this dude they expectations I'ma exceed it\nLike a single with only backgrounds\nY'all record and when it's done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit\nFinally here I'ma star with the timin'\nMy swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin'\nThis for anybody that's searchin' for cash\nAnd purchasin' fast, you only get the dough when you grindin'\nAnd so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne\nMy pain, you can experience through the rhymin', boy\n\n[Chorus]\nStance on lean, leg up on the wall\nMy niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball\nI'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all\nYou waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall\nBut uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do\nDo's what you do, I do what I do\nStance on lean, leg up on the wall\nMy niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball\nI'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all\nYou waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall\nBut uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do\nDo's what you do, I do what I do\n\n[Bridge]\nTwo years ago, a friend of mine\nAsked me to kick some new school lines\nAnd so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death\nNow not signing me is somethin' that the rest regret\nThen I, hopped inside the Cadillac\nThe chauffeur drove off and we never came back\n\n[Chorus]\nStance on lean, leg up on the wall\nMy niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball\nI'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all\nYou waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall\nBut uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do\nDo's what you do, I do what I do"}]}
