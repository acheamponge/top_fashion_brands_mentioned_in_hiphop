(oh who hear me?)\nLouie V linen to the T (oh I'm clean)\nBaby I ain't Christian, I'm street (from the street)\nGo, go, jump out cha' seat (everybody)\nStepping through, Guiness on my feet (anybody)\nIts coming, I can feel it in me (almighty)\nMaybe its the spirit in me (somebody)\nI'm spittin', I be gettin' really deep (in my body)\nSinning please, Lord forgive me (forgive me, look)\nI wonder, could you even hear me? (could you hear me? Look)\nI ain't been gettin' no sleep (no sleep)\nMy family depending on me (on me)\nAddicted to the benjis, I be geeked (I be geekin')\nLately, I been stealing all week (I'm schemin')\nHungry, so I'm stealing just to eat (so I'm schemin')\nEven though I steal, I ain't a thief (but I'm schemin')\nShawty keep feeling on me (oh I)\nShe love me like she worshiping me (It's alright)\nShe ain't praying, but she on her knees (all mighty)\nI'm about to bless her like she sneezed (all mighty)\nTogether, we Adam and Eve (and Eve)\nIf I'm blind, help a nigga see (me see)\nCuban link, fitted on me (on me)\nChandelier glistening, on me (on me)\nAnd I pay my tithe, each week (my dues)\nDamn I'm really feeling the peace (oh I do)\nMaybe it's the jigga in me (jiggaboo)\nI put my fucking pistol in me (.32)\n\n[Outro]\nOh I'm jiggin\nOoh ooh\nMaybe its the jigga\nAye, amazing grace\nCome on now\nCome on now\nCome on now\nI never would've made it\nWithout you\nWithout you"}]}
