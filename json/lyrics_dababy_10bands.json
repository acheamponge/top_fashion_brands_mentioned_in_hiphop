It's the realest shotta\nDon't worry 'bout Baby Jesus, Baby Jesus got it\nRest in peace to Vel-O Johnson, free my cousin Dotty\nCome on, yeah, nigga\n10 bands, 10 bands\n100 bands, fuck it, man\nBaby Jesus in a sprinter van\nBaby Je-Je-Je-Je-Jesus, aw man", "album": "So Disrespectful", "year": "2015-09-25", "title": "10 Bands", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5fff303436ce317346b2deeb6b74d79e.910x910x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DaBaby"}
