An L beat?\n\n[Verse]\nYeah It's Lil Polo bitch, back from the county again, had to get out again\nJust picked up a check to come kill all of you rappers, I'm 'bout to cash in on on them bounties again\n'Lotta niggas in front, I passed up with no effort\nI bet you goofies won't doubt me again\nBitch niggas hate me for that Every time I succeed That shit start to get under they skin\nTables done turned, I'm sitting wit bosses\nThis money talk they can't comprehend\nThat underdog came from the bottom I fuck up they heads cause I wasn't supposed to win\nLotta shit changed, the world will never be the same cause being fake became a trend\nBut out the street, ain't no high-stepping, you gettin exposed if you try to pretend\nWith me it's a difference, I'm way too solid to fold stand in front on all ten\nI got hypnotized with Glocks, sex, money, and now I can't stop from committing them sins\nTo make niggas run, that shit be funny to me so I empty the clip with a grin\nAt a young age you have to show courage through pressure and that's what turned us to men\nIt ain't really about gangs no more, we just ride for the set all these shorties just want they revenge\nLost a few guys to this shit and we from the same block so they name what we gotta defend\nHope on that day I take them steps up to heaven y'all right here they calling me in\nMight dropped a few tears, shake up wit them niggas and make up for all that time we ain't spend\nRIP to my grandma she just passed away try not to show it but that shit caught me deep\nIt broke my heart when my mama came to me and told me that she ain't wake up out her sleep\nI know that you gone but we still had some good times\nSo I got memories to keep\nThinking back on them days she used to fuck up her nose and I'd watch her nod off in the deep\nNever loved you no different I know the woman you was, I looked at you like more than a pete\nWe ain't have no where to go you let us stay with you and make pallets out of covers and sheets\nDestiny wouldn't give us no money I had to go rob just to get both of us something to eat\nI know you would be bragging on how I been doing my thing and  got all of my songs on repeat\nI'm tryna cop a new charm just to show em' I made it\nThat I'm out here dreamchasing like Meek\nBitches be going cause I'm like top ten in my city they know that my flow so unique\nWhen bops suck me up for some hours her head game was crazy, that bitch got good brain like a geek\nHit that slut from the back, I got my thumb in her butt with my left hand grippin' her cheek\nNiggas be wifing these hoes if that's yo bitch then how everybody know she a freak\nBitch I'm Lil Capalot ain't with nun of that woofing so better watch how you speak\nPut that beam on his eyebrow treat his top like a sextape cause his shit gettin' leaked\n.40 start clappin' like yo performance was good that's what you get if you tweak\nHotnem be on that said he applying shit on shorty nem' block flippin' every week\nThe folks beef with us that shit start to get on my nerves it's a war it ain't hide and go seek\nAnd just for Lil 5, we got less points on the board but still tryna go on a streak\nChanging the score that's how you cash in on an opp like fuck it let's go on a spree\nFuck doing drills, kidnap and execute niggas headshot leave them resting in peace\nI'm from Off Sed' where we drop the rakes for the greens and for timtim we throw up a T\nOG used to tell me, \"look at your uncles and shit, is this really who you wanna be?\"\nShe just cared as a mother I was self-centered I looked at it like \"Why you worried about me?\"\nSo no, I ain't listen, I hopped off the porch in them trenches I had to get out of here and see\nMarried to the game before I knew it Everywhere I was love, first sight, I got down on one knee\nNow I want a divorce, this shit been driving me crazy I think this is how it'll be\nIn division 11 stuck in that base uniform looking ugly just wanting to be free\nMama tried warning me, I had to learn the hard way it's too late but I finally agree\nBut I don't regret no mistakes that I made cause all of that shit made me become Polo G\nFuck all reppin' shit I'm tryna cop something foreign that's fast and it don't need a key\nTry to make sure my grandkids straight gotta be up some millions by the time I turn 23\nI can't wait till the day I have everything\nThat I use to sit back and imagine\nGone break this curse of living in poverty for my whole family I'm taking advantage\nGone raise my son, gone' be better than me he gon' be success instead of a savage\nDon't want my shorties to feel what I felt coming up cause for me everyday was a challenge\nBeen through so much for my age so I trapped everyday and I pop all that X just to manage\nWhere I come from to be 18 years old and a felon wit kids is something that's average\nOr you can die on yo block before you see 21 years this shit can get tragic\nThey put a spell on us we just gotta wake up and come together and fix all the damage\nL'z\n\n[Outro]\nOh my God, what is this? An L beat?", "year": "2018-08-17"}]}
