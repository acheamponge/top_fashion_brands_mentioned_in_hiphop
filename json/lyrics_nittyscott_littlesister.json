See, (that\u2019s what they do)\nI know how this game go (how it go)\nI just want to provide you different angles\nLittle angels, wishing that you could stay this way forever\nBut forever's never long enough\nNo, forever don't belong to us\nI know you want to grow up, but there's no need to rush (slow down)\nI take you to a restaurant, we sitting down\nWe getting in the car, open doors how?\nAny man would ever treat you less then\nWhen you've been shown love by your own kin\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3: Nitty Scott, MC]\nUh, uh\nAnd it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay\nI know you gotta find your own way, your own way\nBut baby girl, why they focus on your gender?\nIt\u2019s cool like December, find your center and remember\nTo love your body, it was yours from the start\nSuch a perfect vessel, view it as a work of art\nUh-huh, don\u2019t mind the faces or the races that you came with\nCause your confidence will be a fashion statement\nNever let a man abuse you or use you\nHe reduce you? Well then he gotta lose you\nKiss your grandmother, and your mother too\nCause its love for you that make \u2018em want to smother you\nUh, and make that money for yourself, love\nGet your own, don\u2019t depend on no one else, love\nFurther life cycles when you bloom\nDivine in your design to carry life in your womb\nLittle sister\n\n[Chorus]"}], "artist": "Nitty Scott"}
