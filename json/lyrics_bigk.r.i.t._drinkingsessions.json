Bitch, I'm not for fuckin', over\nI'd be the biggest star, they told me\nSigned my name on that line and when I die, that's when it's over\nMovin' on to the set, I was just a talented black kid\nBut to them, I looked like a check\nAnother five years of slavin' and then it's on to the next\nI was tryna be what I envisioned as a child\nA king ain't a man of God when ain't no church in the wild\nShit been fucked up 'cause they don't talk about Christ\nEverybody trying to die young but who gon' talk about life?\nI pull that card, good Lord, Confederate flag, shit so flawed\nThey used to fly it like pilots and burn crosses in our yards\nI can't get with ya if you with that whistlin' Dixie they want that old time back\nBut niggas got a hundred rounds and automatics so we ain't having that\nI ain't promotin' no violence, it's people out here been wildin'\nSo much that you can get gunned down just for being happy and smilin'\nAin't no hotline worth dialin' to say the world needs help\nWe too busy fillin' our needs that we might kill us ourselves\nI got my gumption from my granny, had a dream about her like last night\nShe held me tight and told me, \"Little one, everything gon' be alright\"\nMy mind playin' tricks on me, but I needed that there\nIn a world where I feel all alone sometimes I'm needin' her care\nIt's hard to share my insecurities so I medicate, I mean meditate\nAnd pray to God for a second chance, for Heaven's sake\nI'm just waitin' on a sign or two, like what I'ma do\nWhen my heart get rusty and tired and it ain't shinin' through?\nAnd I think about death a lot, my father scared of dyin'\nI can relate, I call him before every flight, in case I ain't meant for flying\nI can't hold it back, can't control these tears, I mean after all these years\nI'm still the kid writin' poems, too shy to eat in the cafeteria\nI'm two cups in and three shots away\nFrom givin\u2019 a fuck about any of the shit that I done had to say\nLord knows, it's hard to see the truth with your eyes closed\nIt's hard to protect your feelin's when you so exposed\nYeah, I'm so exposed\nI'm so exposed\n\n[Outro]\nI let it all slip away\nAnd now all I can say\nIs here's a toast to a better day\nAnd the love that will come and stay\nOh God, oh God, oh God, wherever You are, yeah\nI call Your name near and far\nOh God, oh God, oh God, wherever You are, yeah\nI call Your name near and far\nI'm so exposed\nI'm so exposed\nI'm so exposed\nI'm so exposed\nOh God, oh God\nOh God, oh God\nOh yeah, uh"}], "artist": "Big K.R.I.T."}
