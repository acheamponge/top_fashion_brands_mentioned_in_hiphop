Nope, on second thought maybe she do\nGo to school and got a baby or two\nNow she got you wondering if your relationship's through\nListening to Curtis Mayfield's \"Make It To You\"\n\n[Verse 2: Free]\nListen boy if you wanna act up, then listen\nWe can both act up\nI've been tryna be real with you\nBut you keep coming with the drama, I can't deal with you\nIt's the little shit, let me know you're late\nKeep the D rock hard, make sure I'm straight\nI don't ask for much, got a J-O-B, my own dreams\nBut things ain't always what they seem\nI thought you had me baby\nFrom the back to the front thought I was your baby\nBut once I gave in you started acting shady\nStarted acting crazy, don't wanna be your lady no more\nNow all you got is memories of me on all-fours\nThe back of me heading out of your front door\nYou can't blame the seasons, I told you that's what I was needing\n\n[Hook: Free]"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
