And bread for our toddlers?\nSaved in accounts or more belts and wallets\nAnd me I'm part of the problem, purchasing gucci products\nBefore, I put away that money for my daughters collage\nAnd still a great father but times are getting harder\nNo money for private school, I guess should go harder\nTryna lock in in stability, cuz of my family history\nAll of them died broke, so I'm tryna be the remedy\nOur ghetto kids never inherit no stocks and bonds\nThat's something to think about\nWhen you putting them Jordan's on\n\n[Hook: Saigon & Termanology]\nHow the hell am I wrong?\nWhen your people been doing my people wrong for so long\nNow all we got is the hope and the focus to hold on\nY'all been killing us for so long, it can't go on\nHow we both wrong?, damn"}], "artist": "Termanology"}
