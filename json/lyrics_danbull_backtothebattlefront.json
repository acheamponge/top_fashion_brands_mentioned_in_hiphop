I'll start it for ya\nOh yeah\nI will send an inferno\nBurn your final breath\nYou'll find no women, you'll find no men\nFiner than I, or Kylo Ren\nSo why pretend any different\nWhen I don't give a who I offend\nGet in a fight with Iden then\nI will pen you a violent end\nSend my guys to find your friends\nWith an identical plight for them\nHit hyperspace, this sight's amazing\nIt's like a maze of lit light for days\nSky's ablaze, ship's sides are quaking\nJust like the bass, this time we're taking\nThis fight and chasing at lightning pace\nGive the dice a shake, six, strike the base\nWoop, my mistake, hit your hiding place\nYou better find another quick, right away\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't get it back to front\n'Cause after that you're done\nGalactic action, stunts\nMassive guns that pack a punch\n\nSo grab your blaster, pack your lunch\nRun and jump back to the battlefront\nDon't get it back to front\n'Cause after that you're done\n\nGalactic action, stunts\nMassive guns that pack a punch\nSo grab your blaster, pack your lunch\nRun and jump back to the battlefront\n\n[Verse 3]\nEnd these rebels who were striking the Death Star\nThen we'll find where the rest are\nNever rest 'til it's bedtime\nCrying \"Get off the Xbox\"\nAnd they're like \"Yes, ma\"\nThat wasn't my best line\nThat wasn't my best bar by far\nI've kept the best for the end part\nGiving you a headstart, oh, you'll need it\nThe dark side wants your soul to feed it\nAssaulting Theed and leave it molten, beaten\nHalt and heed the alarm call\nThese daft fools wanna start?\nCool\nI'm a glass always half full kind of arsehole\nHarsh, cruel\nSo these bastards wanna play hard ball\nI bring sharp tools\nAnd a lot of fuel for my TIE Fighter\nFly, hi guys, want to carpool?\nAnd can I ask y'all:\nWhy does Admiral Ackbar talk\nLike Ja Rule went to art school\nAnd then got taught fuck all\nCome and fight Darth Maul\nIn a dark hall, while sparks fall\nLike Ponda Baba's arm in a bar brawl\nThat's hardcore\nThat's Star Wars\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't get it back to front\n'Cause after that you're done\nGalactic action, stunts\nMassive guns that pack a punch\n\nSo grab your blaster, pack your lunch\nRun and jump back to the battlefront\nDon't get it back to front\n'Cause after that you're done\n\nGalactic action, stunts\nMassive guns that pack a punch\nSo grab your blaster, pack your lunch\nRun and jump back to the battlefront", "year": "2017-06-12"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
