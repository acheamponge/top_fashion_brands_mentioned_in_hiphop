Hey\nEvery day a star is born\n(And you say New York City!)\nClap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey\n\n[Verse 1: Jay Z]\nI seen Mase do it, I seen Ye do it\nX came through, caught lighter fluid\nStill I came through it; clap for him!\nBut I\u2019m the blueprint, I'm like the map for 'em\nI dropped another classic, made Puff pass it\nNobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it\nWayne scorchin', I'll applaud him\nIf he keep going, pass the torch to him\n50 came through like hurricanes do\nI thought I'd finish his ass at Summer Jam too\nI had the Illmatic on bootleg\nThe shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead\nWayne did A Milli, 50 did a milli\nYe too, but what Em did was silly\nThe white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him\nHis flow on Renegade, fucking awesome; applaud him!\n\n[Hook: The World Famous Tony Williams + Jay Z]\nEvery day a star is born\n(And you say New York City!)\nClap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey\nEvery day a star is born\n(And you say New York City!)\nClap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey\n\n[Verse 2: Jay Z]\nSnoop dogged it, Nelly came down\nThe Face Mob kept it ghetto for the H-town\nLuda moved digits after he moved bitches\nDrake's up next, see what he do with it\nRule had a run, couple movie parts\nT.I. literally wanted to shoot up the charts\nWhat up, Jeezy? What it do?\nY\u2019all remind me of us in early '92\nOutkast landed, 3 thou was ill\nLike a male version of Lauryn Hill\nMobb Deep shook it, but Prodigy took it\nA lil' too far, can't fuck with Brooklyn\nWu-Tang gang-banged it, Meth ate\nRae took on the date with the Purple Tape\nPassed on to Ason and then Ghostface\nThey had a hell of a run, standing ovate, ayyy\n\n[Hook: The World Famous Tony Williams + Jay-Z]\nEvery day a star is born\nClap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey\nEvery day a star is born\nClap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey\n\n[Verse 3: Jay Z]\nAnd I am one of one\nCan\u2019t you see just how long my run?\nMy reign, Lulu's son-shine\nBeen a star since I was duckin' one time\nOne time, give it up for him\nDecember 4th, a star was born\nClap for him! He went from moving that corner\nTo this corner office, it's so enormous\nHey, Pres Carter\nWatch them get they Monica on all day\nHey, got so many different monikers but only one Jay\nThey come, they go, some real, some faux\nSome friends, some hoes\nBut, no, I goes nowhere, this Hov'\n\n[Hook: The World Famous Tony Williams + Jay Z]\nEvery day a star is born\n(And you say New York City!)\nClap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey\nEvery day a star is born\n(And you say New York City!)\nClap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey\n\n[Verse 4: J. Cole]\nAnd could I be a star?\nDoes fame in this game have to change who you are?\nOr could I be the same one who came from a far away life\nJust to make it in these Broadway lights?\nNow I'm shining in the broad day light, go figure\nA slow transition from a little broke nigga from the Ville\nGot a deal, a real life saver\nDreams of being behind the wheel, like Jada\nI chill now, cop a little ice later\nCole, you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber\nSo clap for him! Then applaud Hov, he gave him a platform\nFlow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him\nNo sir, the flow's cold as the shoulders\nOf gold digging hoes when a broke nigga approaches\nTold you I\u2019m focused, man\nI\u2019ll let you motherfuckers soak it in and clap for 'em!\n\n[Hook: The World Famous Tony Williams + J. Cole]\nEvery day a star is born\n(And you say New York City!)\nHey, hey, and clap for 'em! (I'm here now, Fayettenam)\nHey, hey, and clap for 'em!\nClap for 'em! Clap for 'em!\nClap for 'em! J.
