E-40)\n\n[Keak Da Sneak]\nMy family roll thick like syrup and milkshakes\nTransporting weight from the south to the golden state\nSwingin' figure 8's, burnin rubber its hypo\nIn the middle of the intersection, tryin to start up a side-show\nMy mind go in other places cats dont speak on\nDa Raw and uncut, for you niggas to tweak on\nI flip on suckas as they come out rappin\nSo imagine whats gon' happen when I catch you in traffic\nWho sell the most records in the bay(You?)\nIndepentent label(You?) No video and radio play? (You?)\nIts been 86 murders since the start of 2002\nWhen niggas bang turfs for the work\nNot that red and blue, and every single block is a street\nWhen niggas hold it down cause you know we gotta eat\nThey call me Keak Sneak, but my real name is Kunta-Kentay B-O-W-E-N\n\n[Chorus: x2]\nMy nigga told me dont be scared, cause I'ma run the streets\nJust like t-shirt, blue jeans, and Nikes\nCoke white t-shirt, blue jeans, and Nikes\nStay strapped with the 45, I wish a nigga would try\n\n[E-40]\nStyle so unique and Exquisite\nGift-ta-Gabbit, I spit it\nI'm off this Gungie my ninja\nI'm so damn twisted from smokin so much turtle I'm spliffed\nWent to court the other day\nSo I wassa perkin early in the mornin, yawnin off\nThis HIGH SPEED CHASE SHIT!
