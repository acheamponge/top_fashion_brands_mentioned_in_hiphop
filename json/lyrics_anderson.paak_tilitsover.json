Yeah\nYeah, we had fun, if only for the time being\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I'ma ride it 'til it's over\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\n[Breakdown]\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\nRide, I'ma ride it 'til it's over\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\n\n[Chorus]\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\n[Breakdown]\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\nRide, I'ma ride it 'til it's over\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride"}]}
