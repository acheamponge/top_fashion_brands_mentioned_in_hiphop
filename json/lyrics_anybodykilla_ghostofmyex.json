That bitch stressed to death\nBut I did get on the last nerve that she had left\nShe should have never told me that I wouldn\u2019t amount\nCause every standard I see put up I start breaking it down\nThis girl was always on my back trying to tell me what to do\nAnd now I\u2019m sitting in the pitch dark lookin like the fool\nInstead of hanging with homies under the deep blue sky\nI\u2019m being followed by the spirit of a passed on love life\nCause she\u2019s still with me\nBraindead with her wings spread\nClothes still stained from the bloodshed\nShe\u2019s with me like a shadow that ain\u2019t mine\nAnd bottom line wish I could just give her the peace sign\n\nNow we close the gates to Hell\n\n[Hook x4]\n\n[Outro]\n(It\u2019s because of you)\nThat bitch still hates me\n(It\u2019s because of you)\nThat bitch still hates me", "year": "2010-10-19"}]}
