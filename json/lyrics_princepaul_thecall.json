This definitely would not be the first time she bailed me out of a situation. She\u2019s gonna wanna know why we both not going to work. I can\u2019t tell her it\u2019s my first day hustling. All I know is that I had to think of something, quick\n\n[*sound of Tru watching TV*]\n\nTARIQ: Ayo, Tru, where the phone at?\n\nTRU: Ayo, it\u2019s next to the bed\n\n[*Tariq walks over to the phone*]\n\nTARIQ: Aight, man, I\u2019ma call.
