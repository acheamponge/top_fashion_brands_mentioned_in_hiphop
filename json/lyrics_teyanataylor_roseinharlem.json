You ain't pop yet?\nWhat's up wit' you and Ye?\"\n\n[Chorus: (Sample) & Teyana]\n(A rose in Harlem) Grew out the concrete\n(A rose in Harlem) You know it ain't sweet\n(A rose in Harlem) Can't tell me any- any- any- anything\n\n[Refrain]\nIt be the ones who say they ride for you\nIt be the ones, the ones you love, them too\nIt be the ones who swear they real, not true\nIt be them ones, It be them ones\nDon't get caught up\nIt be the ones, the ones you closest to\nIt be the ones, the ones you trust - them too\nIt be the ones, the ones you look up to\nIt be the ones\nDon't get caught up, young girl\n\n[Chorus: (Sample) & Teyana]\n(A rose in Harlem) Grew out the concrete\n(A rose in Harlem) You know it ain't sweet\n(A rose in Harlem) Can't tell me any- any- any- anything\n\n[Verse 2]\nBeen through more than a lil' bit\nBeen through more than a lil' bit\nBut I ain't callin' no names out\nNo, no free promotions\nIf it ain't 'bout blessings\nI can't even address it\nI just bought my third house\nNo album out and I got 'em asking\n'What do she do?' I do everything\nI move everything\nPut that on my wedding ring\nPut that on my baby name\nAll these fake smiles\nThese chicks must just came from a dentist\nI can tell it ain't genuine\nI get so offended\n\n[Chorus: (Sample) & Teyana]\n(A rose in Harlem) Grew out the concrete\n(A rose in Harlem) You know it ain't sweet\n(A rose in Harlem) Can't tell me any- any- any- anything\n\n[Refrain]\nIt be the ones who say they ride for you\nIt be the ones, the ones you love, them too\nIt be the ones who swear they real, not true\nIt be them ones, It be them ones\nDon't get caught up\nIt be the ones, the ones you closest to\nIt be the ones, the ones you trust - them too\nIt be the ones, the ones you look up to\nIt be the ones\nIt be the ones who say they ride for you\nIt be the ones, the ones you love, them too\nIt be the ones who swear they real, not true\nIt be them ones, It be them ones\nDon't get caught up\nIt be the ones, the ones you closest to\nIt be the ones, the ones you trust - them too\nIt be the ones, the ones you look up to\nIt be the ones\nDon't get caught up, young girl\n\n[Outro]\nA rose in Harlem, a rose in Harlem\nA rose in Harlem, a rose in Harlem\nDon't get caught up, young girl"}], "artist": "Teyana Taylor"}
