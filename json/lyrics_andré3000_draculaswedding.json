Here she comes\nThree-thousand, three-thousand\nThree-thousand, three-thousand\n\n[Verse 3: Kelis]\nGive me the chance to dance romance\nDon't run, I'm not the sun\nSo much at stake, oh, bad choice of words\nBut I'm not the gun (shut up) with silver bullets\nAnd I can count (two, three), plus I make great peanut butter\nAnd jelly sandwiches, Van Helsing\n\n[Outro: Kelis]\nFor richer or poorer\nThrough sickness and in health\n'Til death do us part\n'Til death do us part\nYou only live once\nWell, not in our case\n'Cause we live forever"}], "artist": "Andr\u00e9 3000"}
