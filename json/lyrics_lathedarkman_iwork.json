I got kids, and brothers to feed\nNot to mention, my life, my bitches and what I need\nThree story condos, carbon truck, combos\nBang hammers at niggas like Africans on congos\nThat's how my song goes, drugs, money and murder\nCheck and see if you can handle it, 'fore you take it further, it's La\n\n[Chorus 2.5X: La the Darkman]\nI work, I'm real, I shoot, I kill\n\n[La the Darkman]\nPops left, moms had a habit, aunt raised me\nKicked me out of high school, teacher said I was crazy\nThen I caught a CCW, didn't amaze me\nThen I caught a tenth and one, they tried to lay me\nAll through the trial, proves I'm natu-ral\nHad lawyer money then, same as I do now\nYoungster, it's all about guns and butter\nMy first large sum of cash, I took care my mother\nBout her a crib, in the 'burbs, got her out of the gutter\nImagine my stress, cursed at birth, trynna get blessed\nSlip infederal indictments, seems to be my hardest test\nI'm the best, when it comes to flipping ten to twenty\nTwenty to forty, forty to eighty, my shit is gravy\nDouble my condoms, keep my bitch from having babies\nAin't that crazy, hell nah, I see the big picture\nBaby momma child support, keep a nigga from getting richer\nI'm slicker than the average, want something, I grab it\nGet money like junkies smoking crack, it's a habit\nMove O's through traffic, ball like Tim Duncan\nFundimental whips, no chrome, rims or nothing\nEverything's true, getting money up at the scoop\nWith bitches that party by sniffing a line or two\nThis ain't rap, this what I do, like Japanese and kung fu\nYou understand, yeah?\n\n[Chorus 3X]"}], "artist": "La The Darkman"}
