(2x)\nIf you lookin for the bomb (2x)\nIf you lookin for some music (2x)\nWell let me help you choose it (2x)\n\nI'm so glad I got my website\nI ain't worried bout mtv\nI got 20 videos, buy 'em all on dvd\nI'm so glad I got my website\nI ain't worried bout mtv\nI just got my hydraulics\nCome on and caddy hop with me!\n\nCaddy hop baby, caddy hop (3x)\nCaddy hop baby, you don't stop...\n\nThe homies call me afroman\nI rap with a live funk band\nIf you can't buy my music don't sweat\nOrder it of the internet\nI'm never on mtv, but everybody got my cd\nI'm never on the radio, but everybody knows afro\n\nYou say you looking for some music (2x)\nWell let me help you choose it (2x)\nIf you want the bomb (2x)\n\nI'm so glad I got my website\nI ain't worried bout mtv\nI got 20 videos, buy 'em all on dvd\nI'm so glad I got my website\nI ain't worried bout mtv\nI just got my hydraulics\nCome on and caddy hop with me!\n\nCaddy hop baby, caddy hop (3x)\nCaddy hop baby, you don't stop...\n\nMake you caddy hop, at the red light\nDon't trip, go ahead, that shit looks tight\nDon't pass by the homies, unless you hit the switches\nDon't have hydraulics, and act like a bitch!\nWhen you hit the switches get your shine on\nThink about the days, you got your grind on\nSmokin that weed, drinkin that brew\nYou like the lowrider? I like the lowrider too!\n\nCaddy hop baby, caddy hop (3x)\nIt's the bomb! afromanmusic - dot com", "title": "Caddy Hop", "album": "Afroholic: The Even Better Times", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c4fd850563348aed762e3d484ea76e19.500x500x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Afroman"}
