I think the glass half full\nWho pray me back to Inglewood, I shouldn't bleed this good Holy conundrum\nI'm the prayer, the hope, bank account wishin' bone for my loved ones\nTell \u2018em Noname still don\u2019t got no money\nTell 'em Noname almost passed out drinking\nSecret is, she really think it saves lives\nSomebody hit D'Angelo, I think I need him on this one\nBrothers and sisters, mommas, cousins, uncles, everyone\nMissing somebody\nDancing daylight\n\n[Hook]\nI know everyone goes some day\nI know my body's fragile, know it's made from clay\nBut if I have to go, I pray my soul is still eternal\nAnd my momma don't forget about me\nI pray my momma don't forget about me\nI pray my granny don't forget about me\nI know everyone goes some day\nI know my body's fragile, know it's made from clay\nBut if I have to go, I pray my soul is still eternal\nAnd my momma don't forget about me\nI pray my momma don't forget about me\nI pray my daddy don't forget about me\n\n[Verse 2]\nLet's get down to the nitty gritty, changed my city\nTitties 13k, the pretty costs these days\nMy doctor really love me, how I'm only half awake\nI just came from the funeral, my ugly passed away\nWelcome to Beverly Hills\nWelcome to Vicodin, I took the pills\nI think they save lives\nI just hope that they right\nAll I am is everything and nothing at all\nAll I am is shoulder for your heart to lean on\nAll I am is love, all I am is love\n\n[Hook]\nI know everyone goes some day\nI know my body's fragile, know it's made from clay\nBut if I have to go, I pray my soul is still eternal\nAnd my momma don't forget about me\nI pray my momma don't forget about me\nI pray my granny don't forget about me\nI know everyone goes some day\nI know my body's fragile, know it's made from clay\nBut if I have to go, I pray my soul is still eternal\nAnd my momma don't forget about me\nI pray my momma don't forget about me\nI pray my granny don't forget about me"}], "artist": "Noname"}
