She doesn't like the cold\nShe said I got a bright idea, \"Let's go to Mexico.\"\n$500 in the bank, things are looking bad\nImagine if we gotta eat, things are looking sad\n\nBarely in love (repeat) (chorus)\n\nShe looked into the sun and said, \"What's on your mind?\"\nWhee, Ha, lookatiaa, lookatiaa, sun shining all the time (sun shining all the time)\nShe picked up the fan and let the trailer go\nShe only likes it when it's hot. Doesn't like it when it's cold\n\nWhen you really think about it, love is truly powerful\nThe undeniable force that makes it magnetic\nAnd you can't explain it, you do what you do\nCan't noboday play the fool like (something something something?)\n\nBarely in love (repeat) (chorus)"}], "artist": "Q-Tip"}
