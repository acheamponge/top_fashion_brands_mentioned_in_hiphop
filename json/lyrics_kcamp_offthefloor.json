I ain't talking Instagram\nAlley-Oop to Donald and I know he 'bout to slam\nI just want to smoke and take a trip to Amsterdam\nAnd hit a couple hoes who pussy just as sweet as yams\nBaby I'm a player but I'm acting like the coach\nDive inside your water, hit you with the backstroke\nHungry for the green and i ain't talking artichoke\nI drive these hoes crazy hope my license ain't revoked\nYou know these hoes don't love you, they'll fuck you for a check\nThen play you like a sucker\nStay on your A game, don't get played like a buster\nI'ma always stay true nigga word to my mother\n\n{Hook}"}], "artist": "K CAMP"}
