Hey buddy!\nGuess what?\nGot a fun message for you\nHey dude!\nListen up!\nThis is important\nAnd it's from you-know-who! Me!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFirst, you take a G, then an O, then an F\nThen you're gonna need a U and a C-K-Y-OUR-SELF\nYay!\n\n[Chorus]\nG-O-F-U-C-K-Y-O-U-R-S-ELF!\nThat's an awful lot of letters, gee I wonder what it spells?\nG-O-F-U-C-K-Y-O-U-R-S-ELF!\nWishing you and all your family some good and happy health? No\n\n[Verse 2]\nDid you get the message?\nHave you cracked the code?\nDo you know which self you ought to fuck and where you have to go?\nThat's right!\n\nI'm pretty sure you get it\nA big smart guy like you\nThe time is drawing nearer\nSo you know just what to do! Woo-hoo!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOkay everyone, here we go!\nAre you all ready?\nLet's hear it!\n\n[Outro]\nGo fuck yourself!\n(Go fuck yourself)"}], "artist": "Ninja Sex Party"}
