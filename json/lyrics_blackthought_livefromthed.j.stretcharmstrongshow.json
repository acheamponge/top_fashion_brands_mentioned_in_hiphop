musician\nUmbilical mic, my syllable strikes ya vision\nI take you through a tunnel of thought, wit no support\nNow you got caught off guard by the number one scar\nFrom the Illa-Fifth, lyrically fulfillin' this\nBlack Thought, yo, the skill assisted\nBy the Mal-ik B, the symbol you remember me to be type valid\nDisastrous, the master just bust this for the listener\nBlack Thought, yo, while I exhibit the\nStyles from the artist, boast strokes of lyrical darkness\nEnter the style, severin' rooms just like apartments, ill flavor\nI'm a skyscraper by nature\nDown wit my number one neighbor, Common\nFrom the city of Illinois, you destroy when we bombin, what?\nOff the top-a, the dome lyric-al don-datta Mr. Trotter\nAiyyo we gotta lotta MC's, on the line of this ready to rhyme\nSo, I'm just gon' settle down wit mine, rewind, check it out\n\n[Common]\nI pursue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair\nOther niggas rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs\nOn Knotts I Landed, players get played like Hamlet\nSupposedly nice, taken for granted like life\nI write twice and drop singles in record pools\nNiggas I'm dunkin' like when cops mingle, fuck hip hop jingles\nRhymin' big words and not sayin' shit\nThe click that you came in wit, the accent you flavor whipped\nI got my nigga Tariq, I freak it in the middle of the week\nNiggas is weak an' and I start to speakin'\nNiggas start to leakin', my nigga Derek D an'\nI'm foreseein' the future, funky for human beings\nLike I was the Biz Mark, I bring the noise iller\nCom Sense'll be the rhyme killer, I spill a\nLittle bit of juice to an MC who need a new producer\nGot my nigga Y-Not in the spot and I rock like crack\nI'm ready to attack, Thoughts is Black\nNiggas understand the intelligence and relevance to this rhyme\nI Stretch a nigga all across the line like I was Bobbito or Armstrong\nCom's song'll keep goin', I start the holdin'\nMy flowin' is turnin' to the earth\nThe birth is comin' through, listenin' to cut, old school *laughin'*\n?Tremblin when it came down the shoot?\n\n[Pharoahe Monch]\n(Pharoahe) Yeah, yeah (Pharoahe) yeah, yeah\n(Pharoahe) Yeah, yeah yo\nAlways beginnin' 'em, forever blendin' 'em\nBendin' 'em again and again\nSendin' 'em back, lettin' 'em know that minimum wages\nSubliminally befriendin' 'em for criminal ac-tivity\nMics I chop like Florida State Seminoles wit criminal facts\nAnd milly ac-tually I piss on your promotional wax\nIt'll be tight but only this\nWhat nigga swears he's the nicest?\nJust because he got rhyme of the month twice\nFour mic devices, the gem star blade the shit slices\nRip-trip-chop-chop-chop and dices, Absolute\nAbsolute, uh, Absolute, uh, Absolute, uh (kill it)\n\n[Absolute]\nYes, rippin' the microphone\nMy words will enlight your dome\nWhen I'm quick to strike your home just like Capone\nN-Noreaga, wit The War Report, my orator will slaughter yours\nStill waitin' for the beat to come in, I'm dangerous like Satan\nEatin' bacon in front of a Muslim, I'll battle you and your cousin\nIt's the beef for black attack\nWhen I, yes, quick to subtract the wack\nWhen I go from track to track, bouncin' in the mounds and countin'\nFlowin' like water from a fountain when I deliver\nLike water from a river makin' you shiver\nThat's for sore, the connoisseur rippin' ill-literature\nYes, but I'm about to get deeper\nYou'll catch a ill reflection from listenin' too close to the speaker\nWhen I reach ya, it's gettin' more clearer, outta the era\n\n[Black Thought]\nIt's like this, we keep you open like a parachute\nTook a shot of hip hop, it's Absolute\nFor my man from the House of Representatives\nAnd turn it out, aiyyo, I always do, that's what I'mma bout ta\nDo I show you a style and throw you?\nFor all competitors, Black Thought comin' through, so seckle, cuz\nI'm the superior style and you inferior\nLet me adjust my voice so you can hear me ta--\nBust through the, microphone\nPure skills, nuttin' but it, all of a sudden\nMC's just start to stuttered from the rap style\nHey, yo, let me rewind, check it out, check it out\nWell, it's the deranged style that change formats and forms\nI swarm like killa bees, fulfillin' these fantasies\nMC's throw a tantrum, I sing the Fifth Anthem\nAiyyo, it's like this, my song thump your preference\nYou can never attempt to reach that where my level is\nBlack Thought severin' competitives, off the dome top\nYo, my microphone stop, my man Com just drop\n\n[Common]\nAnd don't halt, I guess it was my fault\nI came through thick like a malt, niggas tried to pour salt\nBut never knew the flavor, my shit is accented from Chicago\nNiggas follow, hold the water bottle\nMy shit'll keep flowin'\nNow I'm showin' this poetry in motion like a picture\nRead the scripture, understood the first New Testament\nStart to blessin' it\nThe shit is like this, where the beat went?\nI give MC's the silent treatment\nThey tried to come against me, I told em they wasn't fresh\nRappers I Crush, Kill and Destroy like Stress\nExtinction Agenda, Com Sense'll just send a-nother\nMothafucker to the bathroom\nHe didn't have room to shit on the mic\nThat I had, it's like the nigga Com Sense, I don't need a pad\nOff the dome, my shit'll roam/Rome like a Greek\nI start to speak, and niggas sound extra weak/week\nLike seven days, I take ya seven whole days like Tony\nNever been a phony, Express styles like a Pony\nHold ya horses, Com Sense read The Sources\nToss this type of shit that go straight through, I lost this\nOne time, it came back, the rap sunshine\nNiggas follow me like one time\nCheck it out nig-- my man Absolute is unsigned, ready to get it on\nIt's like this upon the mic, yo, I sit upon\n\n[Pharoahe Monch]\nYo, yo, check it out now, one time now, Pharoahe Monch, yo\nIt's not breaks at the bar, even if you a star\nWit me and my crew, baby doll, you won't go far\nI seek the love of Allah, the laws I lay\nPeepin' the upper echelon of light display\nFunk distributed rap pro, attributed to facts so\nCleverly put, more revolutions than an axle\nThe sax flow, nigga, much smoother than Coltrane\nWho can cop beats that I chop like cocaine?\nThe effortless action wit moves like subtraction\nLip, stick and admit wit mo' satisfaction\nAnd all the while my beats can pile up\nMore data than X-File shows all added up\nThe educated nigga from Queens, by any means\nServe any fiends, similar to Supreme Team\nBut like steam I will rise to the top to redeem the cream\nFor niggas who fiend for hip hop\nI pop Glock and bla-block shot and chop spots\nFrom top notch cops to bust from a crotch\nPositionin', what, Absolute, what, c'mon, c'mon, kick the dome\n\n[Absolute]\nThe last word was precision, so I get a vision\nAnd makin' sentences on top of your cranium\nUnderground, subterranean\nCrossin' the Mediterranean, water to slaughter MC's\nWho I can't catch across the border\nLookin' across the window, not a nympho\nLookin' at my man, the Jedi duck when the lead fly\nMy man just took a picture, so I just snapped it\nLookin' at the man who got the joint in his back, shit, the back shit\nI pack shit but it's never like an automatic\nI'm causin' static just like the opposite of Bounce\nI get, throwin' mad amounts\nLook at my man Bobbito and Stretch\nI gotta catch the beat\nI'm never come off weak cuz weak is the opposite of strong\nI used to smoke the bong but now I got the Heineken\nIt's my turn to rhyme again\nDon't need to be greedy, I give my old gear to the needy\nUsed to write graffiti cuz I got the burner\nYou might not get that\nBut, yo, I pass it back to my man wit the head wrap, yo\n\n*talkin' and shoutouts to end*"}], "artist": "Black Thought"}
