Jumanji..\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell if it go down, while I'm on this earth very promptly\nAnd everyday I'm watching out for niggas tryna hunt me\nFor what I got, real necessities, clothes\nFood, a home niggas don't got those\nShit is fucked up, I stay with my uzi booked back\nFully clips you can't do nothin' to me\nI grabbed this vest off this dead cop I saw laying on East 9th\nAll black Escalade you know I ain't think twice\nTook that me and my crew some niggas we got are new\nThey survived, either get a gun or you through\nEither you lucky or not so lucky, one of the two\nIf you normally shine then niggas is coming for you\nImagine familar faces demanding yo last shit\nPistol to yo upper lip and yeah they might blast it\nDrastic, this shit is book of Eli\nGod bless the earth, please don't let me die\n\n[Hook 2]\nTonight when I roll the windows down and get to bustin'\nI don't give a fuck about too much of nothin'\n(Hey come on this nigga crazy)\nRoll the window down and get to bustin'\nI don't give a fuck about too much of nothin'\n(Ayo come on this nigga crazy)\nRoll the window down and get to bustin'\nI don't give a fuck about too much of nothin'...
