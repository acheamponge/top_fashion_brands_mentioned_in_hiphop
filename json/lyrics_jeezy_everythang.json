The neighborhood hero\nDope game, no shame, nigga more pain\nSeen enough to drive a young nigga insane\nFrom the windows of the trap, see the prison bars\nFlashing lights on top, we call them prison cars\nThis for my niggas make a livin' on they mobile phone\nGrind hard 'til your earrings cost a mobile home\nAin't nothin' wrong with that, get your mobile on\nGet the bricks butt naked, get your Stroker's on\nAll the other bullshit I could have focused on\nSaid fuck that shit and kept my focus on\n\n[Hook: Jeezy]\nI used to have nothing\nBut now I got a whole lot of everythang\nAnd I come through stuntin'\nAnd now the whole world gon' know my name\nAnd I used to have nothing\nBut now I got a whole lot of everythang\nThat's why I come through stuntin'\nWhen I'm gone the whole world gon' know my name\n\n\n[Verse 3: Jeezy]\nYeah they try to stop a nigga but I won't let 'em\nSee the wheels? How the fuck you ain't gon' sweat 'em\nBet you one thing, bet you niggas won't bet 'em\nG5 take off, you know I'm gon' jet 'em\nRoad trips ain't shit, you know I go get 'em\nPlus my man send his check, you know we gon' split 'em\nNow it's so many shoes that I can't wear\nFrom that real nigga cloth, that's why you can't tell\nAlways knew that I'd make it out someday\nTraffic jam, I was going down the one-way\nTwelve used to hit the block, I had to run away\nNow this nigga be flyer than the runway\n\n[Hook: Jeezy]\nI used to have nothing\nBut now I got a whole lot of everythang\nAnd I come through stuntin'\nAnd now the whole world gon' know my name\nAnd I used to have nothing\nBut now I got a whole lot of everythang\nThat's why I come through stuntin'\nWhen I'm gone the whole world gon' know my name", "album": "TM:103 Hustlerz Ambition", "year": "2011-12-14", "image": "https://images.genius.com/08e2d06088a8af47e984f3e82bb14cef.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jeezy"}
