When he lays it down it's gonna...

Sudden death goal\nIt\u2019s that killer instinct that was never left cold\nAnd I\u2019mma kill shit until my last breath \u2013 old as fuck\nLong as my body stays holdin\u2019 up\nAnd even after that I\u2019ll still have something to say to ya\nI\u2019ll rock it like Dilla or Professor Xavier\nI\u2019ll let my students know they\u2019re not mutants\nAnd redirect them from the pollutants that got \u2018em shootin\u2019 each other\nThe ones in control don\u2019t love us\nBut we're brothers, we're brothers (come on)\n\n[Chorus: JTronius and Akrobatik]\n\nAt the end of the day, we all need hope\n\nSo if you ask me \u2018bout the scar on my chest\nI\u2019ll tell you on some Man of Steel shit, \u2018that ain\u2019t a \u2018S\u2019\u2019\nWhen I thought I was done and at the end of my rope\nThey tattooed my body with the symbol for hope, uh-huh\n\n(Hope) My city need it\n(Hope) My family need it\n(Hope) My people need it\n(Hope) the whole world need it (we all need hope)\n(Hope) My city need it\n(Hope) My family need it (ohh)\n(Hope) My people need it\n(Hope) the whole world\n\nWe all need hope", "title": "Hope", "album": "Built To Last "}], "artist": "Akrobatik"}
