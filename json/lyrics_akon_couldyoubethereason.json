Shawty we don't care!\n\nGot shorty right where I want her\nStrapped up, hands trapped in the corner\nGrinding slow, and I won't let go (no-ooh)\nBaby more better than ammonia\nFeeling tipsy from the bottle of Corona (oh-noo)\nShe probably let go (oh-ooh)\nShe said she wants to bring me to bring me to her world\nShe whispers some words\nThat damn near made my toes curl\nShe said she's got that\nThat I have never seen before\nAnd if I get the taste\nI'll be coming right back for more\nAnd that's when I noticed\nPeople are watching!\nBut we don't care\nThe way I am touching your body\nCuz we don't care\nSee you droppin' and poppin'\nBut we don't care\nMakes me want to keep grinding\nBut we don't care (oh-ooh)\nSee I bet you're nasty\nWhen you're on the dance floor\nYou got me going: Oh-Oooh!\n\nCould you be the reason why I'm losing control\nFo Sho! Shawty we don't care!\n\nI'm working your body\nLike you are in my bedroom\nYeah\u2026Yea\u2026Uh-uhh\u2026Yeah\u2026Yeah\nEverybody in the club got a clear view\nBut that won't stop us\nCuz we don't care!\nPeople are watching!\nWe don't care\nThe way I am touching your body\nCuz we don't care\nSee you droppin' and poppin'\nBut we don't care\nMakes me want to keep grinding\nBut we don't care (oh-ooh)\nSee I bet you're nasty\nWhen you're on the dance floor\nYou got me going: Oh-Oooh!\n\nCould you be the reason why I'm losing control\nFo Sho!
