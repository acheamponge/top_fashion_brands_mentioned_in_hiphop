{"songs": [{"lyrics": "A word from Hov\n\nLast night I performed at the University of Arizona, I had a ball!! Through all the excitement and joking around (as well as the technical difficulties) I missed out on the opportunity to say something important..\n\nOn the show as well were Third Eye Blind and Kelly Clarkson.. I thought that to be the oddest pairing EVER but, soon realized, it\u2019s what I\u2019ve always professed..There is NO such thing as BLACK music or WHITE music only GOOD or BAD music..It\u2019s stupid cool to like things that are not like you, and that goes for outside of music.. If you\u2019re an African American you can have a jewish friend. Wait, does Lyor having some Israeli mixed with his jewish count? (Sure they are paranoid but, so are black people after they\u2019ve smoked weed, haaaaa, and plus the JEW fro and the BLUEprint fro are the SAME thing.)\n\nI think concerts like this should happen more often. ( Outside of the one or 2 festivals a year or \u201cZootopia\u201d) I\u2019m putting that into the universe..next up Taylor Swift and Uncle Murda!!\n\nSorry I don\u2019t \u201cTweet\u201d (do I?) so this will have to do..\n\nLove", "title": "A Word From Hov", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf0f68ee56f29c8542ad805c6419682b.676x676x1.jpg", "year": null, "album": null}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
