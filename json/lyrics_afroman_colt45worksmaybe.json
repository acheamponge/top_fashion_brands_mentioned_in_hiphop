{"songs": [{"lyrics": "Wait a minute man\nHey check this out man tell it\nIt was this blind man right, it was this blind man right\nHe was feelin' his way down the street with a stick right, hey\nHe walked past this fish market, you know what I'm sayin'\nHe stopped he took a deep breath he said\nWoah good morning ladies, ha\nYou like that shit man\nHey man I've got a gang of that shit man\nHey I'll tell you what\nWe'll all have a good time\nWe'll pull on the drug\nAnd hey, hey if everybody crowd around the mic\nI'll tell you all these motherfuckin' jokes I got\nFirst I'm gonna start off like that, hey help me sing it homeboy\n\nSaid Colt 45 and two Zig Zags baby that's all we need\nWe can go to the park, after dark\nSmoke that tumbleweed\nAs the marijuana burn we can take our turn\nSingin' them dirty rap songs\nStop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong\nAnd sell tapes from here to Hong Kong\nSo roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems\nFeelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale\nSkatin' on Dayton rims\nSo roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe Deville\nIf my tapes and my CDs just don't sell, I bet my Caddy will\n\nWell it was just sundown in small white town\nThey call it East Side Palmdale\nWhen the Afroman walked through the white land\nHouses went up for sale\nWell I was standing on the corner sellin' rap CDs\nWhen I met a little girl named Jan\nI let her ride in my Caddy\n'Cause I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan\nWe fucked on the bed\nFucked on the floor\nFucked so long I grew a fuckin' afro\nThen I fucked to the left (Left)\nFucked to the right (Right)\nShe sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white\nI thought to myself sheeba-sheeba\nGot my ass lookin' like a zebra\nI put on my clothes and I was on my way\nUntil her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet\nAnd so I ran I jumped out the back window\nBut her daddy he was waitin' with a two-by-four\nOh, he beat me to the left\nHe beat me to the right\nThe motherfucker whooped my ass all night\nBut I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad\nThat's the best damn pussy I ever had\nGot a bag of weed and a bottle of wine\nI'm gonna fuck that bitch just one more time\n\nColt 45 and two Zig Zags baby that's all we need\nWe can go to the park, after dark\nSmoke that tumbleweed\nAs the marijuana burn we can take our turn\nSingin' them dirty rap songs\nStop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong\nAnd sell tapes from here to Hong Kong\nSo roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems\nFeelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale\nSkatin' on Dayton rims\nSo roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe Deville\nIf my tapes and my CDs just don't sell, I bet my Caddy will\n\nI met this lady in Hollywood\nShe had green hair but damn she looked good\nI took her to my house 'cause she was fine\nBut she whooped out a dick that was bigger than mine\nI met this lady from Japan\nNever made love with an African\nI fucked her once, I fucked her twice\nI ate that pussy like shrimp-fried rice\nDon't be amazed at the stories I tell ya (Tell ya)\nI met a woman in the heart of Australia\nHad a big butt and big titties too\nSo I hopped in her ass like a Kangaroo\nSee I met this woman from Hawaii\nStuck it in her ass and she said \"AIEE\"\nLips was breakfast, pussy was lunch\nThen her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch\nI met Colonel Sanders wife in the state of Kentucky\nShe said I'd fry some chicken if you'd just fuck me\nI came in her mouth, it was a crisis\nI gave her my secret blend of Herbs' n' Spices\n\nColt 45 and two Zig Zags baby that's all we need\nWe can go to the park, after dark\nSmoke that tumbleweed\nAs the marijuana burn we can take our turn\nSingin' them dirty rap songs\nStop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong\nAnd sell tapes from here to Hong Kong\n\nI met Dolly Parton in Tennessee\nHer titties were filled with Hennessy\nThat country music really drove me crazy\nBut I rode that ass and said \"Yes Miss Daisy\"\nMet this lady in Oklahoma\nPut that pussy in a coma\nMet this lady in Michigan\nI can't wait 'til I fuck that bitch again\nMet a real black girl down in South Carolina\nFucked her until she turned to a white albino\nFucked this hooker in Iowa\nI fucked her on credit, so I owe her\nFucked this girl down in Georgia\nCame in her mouth, man I thought I told ya\nMet this beautiful sexy ho\nShe just ran across the border of Mexico\nFine young thing said her name's Maria\nI wrapped her up just like a hot tortilla\nI wanna get married but I can't afford it\nI know I'mma cry when she get deported\n\nColt 45 and two Zig Zags baby that's all we need\nWe can go to the park, after dark\nSmoke that tumbleweed\nAs the marijuana burn we can take our turn\nSingin' them dirty rap songs\nStop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong\nAnd sell tapes from here to Hong Kong\nSo roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems\nFeelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale\nSkatin' on Dayton rims\nSo roll,
