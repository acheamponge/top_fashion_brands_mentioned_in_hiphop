(The IV) Yeah, yeah! Braille Brissik in the place! Like this!\n\n[Hook 1]\nThe IV! Defines my name! Know'msayin? Yeah! Yo, man, what is it? The IV, wha-wha-what defines my name\n\n[Verse 1]\nLyricism don\u2019t sell no more, that\u2019s what they say but I just ignore it, I won\u2019t forfeit, I push forward, the fourth record, this is a force to be reckoned with, I\u2019m like a wrecking ball tearing down the wall, kick open the door when I step to the bass drum, passion in my lungs, spit till my face is numb, worldwide, but I\u2019ll never forget where I came from, I\u2019m going long-distance with short circuits, I\u2019ll leave behind more money for more purpose, have you ever heard an emcee like this? I tell it how I see it like an eyewitness, then I broadcast all the true facts, 12 years in the game, walking a narrow path, climbing uphill, this is dedication, constant elevation, bringing the medication\n\n[Hook 2]\nYo!
