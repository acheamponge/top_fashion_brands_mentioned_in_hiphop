It was me, Wiley\nTop boy riddims, yeah, made by me\nBut I didn't have any riddim in the tank though\nThat's why man had to phone up G\nI sold vinyl, now I sell MP3s\nAnd along with them, yeah, I sell CDs\nWhen I get a haircut, shape up's right\nCan't look like a 50 inch LCD\nI've got time on my hands, grime in my hand\nBut grime, me and fans, we was in a full circle\nThey look into your life, don't matter if it's personal\nCould be good, could be hurtful\nYeah, it's all human instinct\nWe're just following human imprints\nWe think we started this, started that\nWhen you look on the real side, we're wrong in an instant\n\n[Hook]\nI said you ain't gonna get anywhere with all that hate in your heart\nDon't wanna take too much of the grime legacy so I'm taking a part\n\"What you gonna do musically now it's not all about making your mark?\"\nWell, I'm back where I wanna be, it's not about money, I'm chasing the art\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I'm chasing, I'm chasing, I won't stop chasing\nNo system is gonna block the creation\nI'm a grime king of the king conversations\nNot a grass, I don't need compensation\nI'd be further if I was more patient\nLike waiting for the trains at Euston station\nAlways in a race with the time and\nI ain't gonna win but I'm racing\nI run up on the stage like bang, came with a bang\nDidn't even wanna be a lyrical thang\nBut it's dead where I'm standing, could've been stranded\nIf I never worked every day like my Nan did\nSome dons, they don't wanna work though\nWhile I'm here sitting with a workload\nEven though I didn't get paid any money for my first shows\nIn music, I've got a name that the world knows\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nDon't throw shots, cause I will throw shots\nWe could throw pans, or we could throw pots\nWe could throw houses, we could throw shops\nI don't give a damn because I've seen the whole lot\nI said don't throw shots, I will throw shots\nWe could throw keys or we could throw locks\nWe could throw stones or we could throw rocks\nI don't give a damn because I've seen the whole lot\nI said don't say nuttin' if you ain't saying somethin'\nJust cuh man are cool, don't press my button\nYes, I got dons on my side who will curry man\nPepper man, just like mutton\nEvery now and then we've gotta make an exception\nWhen dons storm the game like Stormzy and Section\nTeam went quiet for a while but\nNow we are headed in the right direction\n\n[Hook](x2)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5401140fa870746f7025a82fe88d83f7.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "Grime 2015", "title": "Chasing the Art"}]}
