"[Intro]\nChopsquadDJ on the beat so it's a banger\n\n[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]\nAll bark, no bite, that's what these niggas is, hol' up\nPut my whole neck on ice, that's what my jeweler did\nBust down paw, bust down bear, all of my charms\nPatek on my left, AP on my right, all on my arms\nMiami too hot, tell the plug get 'em to Boca Raton\nJust got off parole, I hit the dope once, I choked up a lung\nTake a nigga bitch, get deep in (deep in), Instagram hoes wanna meet him (wanna meet me)\nIf she ain't talkin' 'bout eatin' him (bitch eat it), leave that bitch in the DM\nJust had a meeting with Diddy (Diddy), Durkio took me to Izzy\nI go to sleep in Y3 (sleep), used to mix Nike with Dickies (facts)\nCame a long way from my city (Detroit), I made it outta them trenches (them trenches)\nUsed to wear my uncle's hoodies and fitteds, even though I couldn't fit 'em\nNow I'm at Lou's deli with the Glock out, lookin' for niggas, they not out\nI'm killin' them niggas, they pop out, big chop stick get knocked down\n\n[Bridge: Tee Grizzley]\nThat's a hunnid bands, two hunnid bands\nShit won't fall (shit won't fall), shit won't spill (shit won't spill)\nThree hunnid bands, four hunnid bands\nHalf a M (half a mil), no advance\n\n[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]\nDon't even trip (don't even trip), don't even trip\nLook at my fit, that's too much drip, don't even trip (that's too much drip)\nI only hit once, that's still your bitch, don't even trip (still your bitch)\nI got that stick, I'm surgical with it, don't even trip\nDon't even trip (don't even trip in this bitch), don't even trip\nShe just wanna flick, that's still your bitch (still your bitch)\nDon't even trip (don't even trip in this bitch), don't even trip\nI got that stick, nigga don't even flinch (don't even flinch in this bitch)\n\n[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]\nMy ice like Klondike (What the hoe doin'?), got your bitch shiverin'\nAP, that's a suicide slush (all flavors), wet floor, slippery\nI got the bag like Migos and Gucci (I get the bag)\nShe rock a bag Emilio Pucci (Pucci)\nDon't even trip, you know where she at\nI just want the top, I'll Uber her back\nThis big ol' clip in the way of my drip\nDiamonds they hard, I busted my lip\nIf I feel disrespected, this Draco gon' rip\nI got the foreigns and guns like TIP\nYe, two hunnid grand (what it do?), broke my rubber band (damn what else?)\nHalf a ticket cash, it won't fold, won't bend (what my wrist cost?)\nTwo shows, one night, that's a eighty piece (Jerry Rice)\nFour sprites, two pints, I pour eight a piece\nStrapped up to the teeth, my enemies prayin' for peace\nMy gorillas get busy, and you know I'm from Memphis I'm fuckin' with Grizzley\n\n[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]\nDon't even trip (don't even trip), don't even trip\nLook at my fit, that's too much drip, don't even trip (that's too much drip)\nI only hit once, that's still your bitch, don't even trip (still your bitch)\nI got that stick, I'm surgical with it, don't even trip\nDon't even trip (don't even trip in this bitch), don't even trip\nShe just wanna flip, that's still your bitch (still your bitch)\nDon't even trip (don't even trip in this bitch), don't even trip\nI got that stick, nigga don't even flinch (don't even flinch in this bitch)\n\n[Verse 3: Tee Grizzley]\nDon't even trip when you see how that water be drippin' all over the Prezzy (splash, splash)\nWait, let me talk to the ladies, gotta put this in perspective\nDon't fuck with me if you expectin' for me to keep callin' and textin' (textin' and callin')\nFuck her then go for her bestie, got that bitch callin' me messy\nNecklace, heavy, pointers, carats\nShe seen it, starin', got caught, embarrassed\nLocation, send it, go get her, mansion\nNo panties, erection, naked, hol' up, catch it\nSlide the Wraith up and down the lines when the sun outside\nWhen I'm in your town I need 40 thousand just to come outside\nNeck gon' glow, wrist gon' dance, two hunnid bands, what's my advance?\nI blew that shit in a month and a half (facts), made it right back and I blew it again (facts)\nIf I want to I can do it again, run up on me, I'ma shoot at his head\nShoot at his face, I got that Drake, beat my case, free Tay-K\nMe and Lil D body the beast, MAC in the cut, put you to sleep\nThink shit sweet, you gon' bleed, bitch don't even trip\n\n[Bridge: Tee Grizzley]\nThat's a hunnid bands, two hunnid bands\nShit won't fall (shit won't fall), shit won't spill (shit won't spill)\nThree hunnid bands, four hunnid bands\nHalf a M (half a mil), no advance\n\n[Chorus: Tee Grizzley]\nDon't even trip (don't even trip), don't even trip\nLook at my fit, that's too much drip, don't even trip (that's too much drip)\nI only hit once, that's still your bitch, don't even trip (still your bitch)\nI got that stick, I'm surgical with it, don't even trip\nDon't even trip (don't even trip in this bitch), don't even trip\nShe just wanna flip, that's still your bitch (still your bitch)\nDon't even trip (don't even trip in this bitch), don't even trip\nI got that stick, nigga don't even flinch (don't even flinch in this bitch)"}], "artist": "Tee Grizzley"}
