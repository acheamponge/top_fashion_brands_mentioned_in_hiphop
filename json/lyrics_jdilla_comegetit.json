Zion\nWhack niggas get screamed on\nAnd highly retire\nI got the eye of the tiger like Rocky's theme song\nStep in the concrete jungle\nI bust you til you see doubles\nThen watch all four of me reach for you\nThe heat bubble ready to cock back\nI'm aimin shots at any nigga\nI even got midgets wit triggers hidden inside of top hats\nReady to kill ya\nWe fully armed like Dr. Octagon\nSkinny limbs that flip cocky arm\nCough up lung if you wanna tango\nBest run ya ankles\nYou ain't fly\nYa vocals sound dry like they under rain coats\nAnd the same niggas that's still after me\nThey get chills when it get back to me\nThen peel back they feet like an athelete\nThen when they turn they back to me dramatically\nThem and the ground collide til they pop up on the other side wit the Japanese\nI mean business\nTo oppose would be suicide\nYa middle name would be mud like kalauah slide\nAll you hear is slugs\nSo you move and dodge\nAnd try to run for cover\nI'm on some other, other, other\nSkip ya level I'm above that\nSo what you love rap and you want mine\nI make ya very punchline sound like love taps\nThey don't hit right\nThrow ya fist right\nI fist fight with a mic\nTo submit like\nTo ya insight\nThen I'm a leave ya area walked you\nArogant dogs\nThey claim you carryin sparks but couldn't bury a corpse\n\n(J Dilla)\nHa huh say\nWhat you want, what you want, where you at, where you at\nWhat you want, what you want, where you at, where you at\n\n(Elzhi)\nYou lookin for me under a rock, a bush or a tree\nI jump on ya block and stomp you til my foot is asleep\n\n(J Dilla)\nWhat you want, what you want, where you at, where you at\nWhat you want, what you want, where you at, where you at\n\n(Elzhi)\nYou lookin for me run in ya spot bullet and heat\nI bust off a Glock and snuff you til you put in the deep\n\nSay uh\n\n(*If you want it come and get it*)"}], "artist": "J\u00a0Dilla"}
