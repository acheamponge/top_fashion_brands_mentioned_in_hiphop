Just to pay these school loans?\nPlotting on the hustle but I\u2019m knowing that ain\u2019t cool though\nOne of my friends got sentenced for years\nI ain\u2019t right enough I was being selfish it\u2019s clear Yo E if you listening I apologize I was running from the old me\nTryna follow Christ You was with me in them streets\nYou took them blows for me\nThe least I could done was try to hold you down my G\nI got love for you hoping you see what happened in time\nWe both guilty I just been acquitted of mine\n\nI\u2019m free\n\nLord I pray\nYou wash away\nAll these things\nI\u2019ve got on me Cause\nI\u2019m afraid to walk away\nFrom the man\nI used to be\nSo break away\nAll these chains\nSo I can finally be free\nI\u2019m finally free (2x)\n\nHey yo this verse is for my siblings\nWish that we was closer\nMomma said she think that it will happen\nWhen we older But truth be told\nWe would prolly be close\nIf the old me was still here but now\nHe\u2019s a ghost I know\nI was the catalyzer starting all the trouble And now my life changed and I'm steady on the hustle\nBe wanting to call more but I don't know what to say\nBut your name is on my lips every night that I pray\nKnow you thinking I'm a preacher man\nI'm just tryna live in the light of the son who's so faithful to forgive\nWasn't first to get married but I'm first to have kids\nLet me be first to apologize for anything I did\nIt's hard to walk away from the only life that you know\nThe closer I get to God the more I learn and I grow\nHope you seeing my life you know I been changed\nI ain't do this on my own man God intervened I'm free\n\nLord I pray\nYou wash away\nAll these things\nI\u2019ve got on me Cause\nI\u2019m afraid to walk away\nFrom the man\nI used to be\nSo break away\nAll these chains\nSo I can finally be free\nI\u2019m finally free (2x)\n\nLastly to every lady that I dated or manipulated\nI hate to say it but my commitment was overrated\nI was dedicated to being free\nI thought that I could find it somewhere between you and me\nBut I was wrong I kept moving on treating you like an object\nBut you know that I've grown\nI finally found the freedom unlike any I had known\nYou were never the problem it was me all along\nAnd now I thank my wife for dealing with my past\nOur covenant's 'til the death promised that we would last\nIf that was the old me the first sign of trouble I'd flee\nThank God I'm finally free that's real\n\nLord I pray\nYou wash away\nAll these things\nI\u2019ve got on me Cause\nI\u2019m afraid to walk away\nFrom the man\nI used to be\nSo break away\nAll these chains\nSo I can finally be free\nI\u2019m finally free (2x)"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
