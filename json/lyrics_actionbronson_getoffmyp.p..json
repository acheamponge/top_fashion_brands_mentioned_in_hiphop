{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1: Action Bronson]\nLace up your Timbs, Queens, fresh off the blacktop\nOff Broadway recital, fiends on the backlot\nBack alley Bronson always cookin' up a mad plot\nThe shit that have us laid in Benzes with a glass top\nHash pot, stickin' out the dash spot\nI'll leave a bitch in a vacant and let his ass rot\n174 and autobahn is where the cash drop\nThen take the paper, then distribute to the have-nots\nI'm on the scene, 26, and I'm a manchild\nLong machete, hopping out the van style\nWhether fightin' or graffiti, got them hand styles\nI'll wipe the floor up with your face like a ShamWow\nHands down, one motherfucker\n260 combined, here to bring the ruckus\nThe bassline plus the words raise the crime rate\nBronsolini show 'em how to hold a 9 straight\n\n[Hook]\nYo, get off the next man's P.P\nBe original, kid, get off the P.P\nGet off the shaft of my dick, get off the P.P\nYo, be original, kid, get off the P.P\n\n[Verse 2: Action Bronson]\nYo, the drugs are rolled up, the money fold up\nI love my bitches big-body like an old truck\nWith their waists sliced thin just like the cold cuts\nBeen at the bottom of the sea, but then I rose up\nFeet first, my voice is known to curl a honey's toes\nServe a pound of that, I'll leave 'em with a bloody nose\nSmoke the hash, takin form just like it's putty, holmes\nHop in the Caddy, leave your body by a muddy road\nA dirty rotten scoundrel like Steve Martin\nDrugs so good, Fiend Weekly just three-starred 'em\nI'm on the road, blow trees through East Harlem\nJust put me in a cage in the basement, I'm retarded\nGerman shift, twist, burn the bliss\nI love it when the pussy tighter than a tourniquet\nCopped the chicken, started cookin' and converted it\nDutch leaf, third of it, roll it up, murder it\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Get Off My P.P.", "album": "Bon Appetit.....
