The plug?\nNothin' that can save you, your life is now above\nI wouldn't even give a fuck if you and I were blood\nNo one lent their helpin' hand, got it out the mud\nRappers in the industry see me and give me hugs\nThen they gossip with their partners in private, I've seen it done\nFat boy you a bitch, you know how I come\nMAC 11 rangin', slangin', cuddles with the drum\nKeep my name out your fuckin' mouth, endin' off your tongue\nDouble 0, 17, my BGs sellin' drugs\nDrought 'round Hollygrove, key need me to flood\n\n[Chorus]\nAttention, you are in the presence of a gangsta\nPlease don't be alarmed, for the money I'm impatient\nAttention, you are in the presence of a gangsta\nGoin' hard or you starve, I don't see no sense in waitin'\nA gangsta, all this pain, it get rough\nNo retreat, we don't sleep, when it's beef we gon' hunt\nAnd I'm lookin' for some niggas with some bitch ways\nI ain't shit, shaved or bathed in like six days\n\n[Verse 2]\nKing Leonidas at his finest, no witness so who assaulted you?\nTalk to God, go to war, think, consult with the oracle\nKevin Gates' face front page in the article\nLawyer paid, dismissed the whole case, they'll slaughter you\nRun and I observe, ain't no sense in bein' audible\nQuarterback call the audibles, switch the play on the blitz\nHarlem at the Rucker, dick suckers watchin' the kid\nRust color Timbs with a gun up under my gear\nThump through the slums and slump me somethin' forreal\nCut off one of your fingers and puncture one of your ribs\nYoungin' really thuggin', guerilla hustlin' for real\nBody tatted, DJ Drama, that gangsta shit in my grill\nLay loose with a Llama or stank a bitch if he squeal\nSet outside the store that my gangsta bitch just went in\nAt the pharmacy poppin' 'scripts, my prescriptions is gettin' filled\nI love her, took her name and encrypted it in my ear\n\n[Chorus]\nAttention, you are in the presence of a gangsta\nPlease don't be alarmed, for the money I'm impatient\nAttention, you are in the presence of a gangsta\nGoin' hard or you starve, I don't see no sense in waitin'\nA gangsta, all this pain, it get rough\nNo retreat, we don't sleep, when it's beef we gon' hunt\nAnd I'm lookin' for some niggas with some bitch ways\nI ain't shit, shaved or bathed in like six days\n\n[Verse 3]\nAppreciate the help that's been comin' on nothin' will I depend\nWhen asked about the pen, if I'm goin' back that depends\nFaucet water brought me to places to say I ventured\nOlder I can cope with soda, pull off in the grey Avenger\nI want her, she pushin' kids in the stroller, who? For her sister\nThe purchase skirts with some purses but couldn't flirt with her friendship\nJewels, DVD, Raheem murdered by Bishop\nPaid in full, no disappearance, dealers be switchin'\n[?] clip rich then snitch, tellin' the business\nI see this every day, deceit, failure to mention\nTen toes deep, want my money on fleek\nSection 8 voucher and public housin', we livin'\nMama callin' Meals on Wheels, they won't deliver\nCame up quick in the trenches when we was little\nCall a pizza man and rob him when they deliver\nI should write a book entitled, I Promise I Really Did It\n\n[Chorus]\nAttention, you are in the presence of a gangsta\nPlease don't be alarmed, for the money I'm impatient\nAttention, you are in the presence of a gangsta\nGoin' hard or you starve, I don't see no sense in waitin'\nA gangsta, all this pain, it get rough\nNo retreat, we don't sleep, when it's beef we gon' hunt\nAnd I'm lookin' for some niggas with some bitch ways\nI ain't shit, shaved or bathed in like six days"}], "artist": "Kevin Gates"}
