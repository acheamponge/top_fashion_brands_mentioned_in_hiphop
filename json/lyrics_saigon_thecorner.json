Paint the windows black.  It\u2019s over now\n\n[Verse 1: Saigon]\nFinally home from up\nNorth, shit.  Already, talk leaking through the faucet\n\u2018Cause I ain\u2019t slinging horse shit, they think that I\u2019m on some soft shit\nWhatever, God.  I\u2019ma work hard to find me a job\nIf that don\u2019t work, let them be the first jerks that I rob\nBut no, I\u2019m trying change it around.  Tired of being\nChained to the ground.  From Africa, we came with a crown\nWhen you\u2019re locked down, your mind frame remaining in town\nYou hardly ever had nightmares of getting slain on the Nile\nFast as they released me, I done turned out my man who want\nTo piece me with a key, see, to flip it whenev\u2019 it easy\nBut now I\u2019m job hunting, feeling the more aggravation\nKnowing when they seen \u201cConvicted,\u201d they tore the application\nThey probably placed it in the wastebin while I\u2019m at the crib\nPacing, waiting impatient for a call they ain\u2019t making\nAnd if I baked a cake, then my momma be stressing honesty\nHere and now like, \u201cHoney, what happens ain\u2019t what you promised me\u201d\n\u201cMommy, honestly, look: I got strikes first.  With a nigga, second\nThey think I was living hectic \u2018cause I got a prison record\nYou think they believe I did dirt but was disinfected?\nNo, they just neglect to tell me if I come in there, I was misdirected\u201d\n\n[Hook: [?] with Background Vocals by Saigon]\nFrom the\nStreet corner to the jail cell block\nLost souls, crack fiends, and crooked cops\nCrime sprees, cheap wine, trees, and drug spots\nThey say it\u2019s all good when it\u2019s really all not\nSomeone is crying.  I feel your pain\nSwallow your tears and call out my name\nA lifetime of sorrow gets burned in the flame\nThe sun comes tomorrow to chase away the rain\n\n[Verse 2: Saigon]\nYo, how\nCouldn\u2019t I serve fiends?  There was fifty-six in my building\nI even hit the souper with something for fixing our ceiling\nI was the only kid at thirteen out at four in the morning\nNiggas was in their mirrors, I was on the corner yawning\nRunning with kids that was wanted\u2014murder ones and beyond.  The\nPolice reacting off any info the informants respond with\n(There was I), captivated by garments, Rugers with the\nChrome compartments, teenagers with keys to their own apartments\nYoung king, my corner park bench.  Sold this nigga Drab\n50 slabs.  Just got out his sixth rehab.  The fuck\nDid I care?  The hell of a hole in his cerebellum come\nDummy wanna smoke jumbs?  Dammit, I\u2019m selling him some\nThat was my attitude after that street life molested me\nListen so you can see how shit indirectly affected me\nSame nigga Drab who I told you I sold them slabs to\nNeeded more to maintain and was down to do what he had to\nWalked up on this old lady, put his hand in his pocket and told her\n\u201cGive me the purse!\u201d She screamed, hoping the coppers would roll up\nHe grabbed the purse, which was strapped to her opposite shoulder\nShe hit her head and leg when she fell, but her noggin was swoller\nBefore anyone could stop to console her, Drab was showing me\nWhat he got in his hold-up.  Noticed my mother wallet\u2014hold up!\nMy brain blanked, swore before God.  Looked to see\nOne of my old report cards splattered, drabbled over the courtyard\nNo, my ma never recovered from my backless war\nFractured skull.  Said she might walk again, but they ain\u2019t sure\nDrab moms still wanted relentlessly.  When they sentenced\nMe, she requested that I get no less than infinity\nAll of this is fiction, but just as well could\u2019ve been real\nWhat they call killing four patients with one pill and it\u2019s\nIll, but it\u2019s real\nAnd it\u2019s ill, but it\u2019s real, and it\u2019s ill, but it\u2019s real\n\n[Hook: [?] with Background Vocals by Saigon] (x2)\nFrom the\nStreet corner to the jail cell block\nLost souls, crack fiends, and crooked cops\nCrime sprees, cheap wine, trees, and drug spots\nThey say it\u2019s all good when it\u2019s really all not\nSomeone is crying.  I feel your pain\nSwallow your tears and call out my name\nA lifetime of sorrow gets burned in the flame\nThe sun comes tomorrow to chase away the rain", "album": "The Best of Saigon A.K.A.
