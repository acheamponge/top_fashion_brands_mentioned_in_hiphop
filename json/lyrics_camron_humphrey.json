I throw flames\nOn the strip, no strippers\nBut she suckin' the tip, I might tip her\nUnderstood in my hood, that's the way we go\nYou can't comprehend or understand the ratio\nFrom a baby, yo, pop got no money for milk\nThe .380 blow, up-up-away we go\nNo cash to help out your lady, yo\nAnd look out for baby bro\nShould I rob a bank? Tell me somethin', yes, go, maybe, no\nWhat I do next? Get crackhead fellatio\nThey thought I was slow like Radio\nA couple years later, though, they heard me on the radio\n\nWhoa, bro, yo, Killa (..Killa)\nA-Trak, na'm sayin?\nIt's heartfelt\n\n[Outro: A-Trak scratches]\nKilla Cam in the buildin'\nDipset!\nWhat the game been missin'\nSomethin' incredible that's about to take place\nCam got the shit to pop"}]}
