(Did you leave so fast?)\nWould you mind if I hold your hand tonight? (If I hold your hand?)\nWhat are you afraid of anyway?\nI'm not coming back, it's now or never (Now or never, it's now or never)\nTell me why did you leave so fast? (Did you leave so fast?)\nWould you mind if I hold your hand tonight? (If I hold your hand?)\nIt's now or never\n\n[Outro]\nNow or never, ooh\nNow or never, now or never\nOh yeah", "year": "2019-05-03"}]}
