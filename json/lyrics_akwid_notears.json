Not so long ago\nSomeone took two of my best boys out\nFuck that! So I'm dedicating this track right here\nWith much respect to my boy Kiko out of Compton\nAnd Flu out of Aliso\n\n[Verse 1: AK]\nNow that's my muthafuckas!\nWhat better way to describe 'em?\nThe baddest I've known\nPuttin' it down for Compton (and Aliso)\nAnd something about this\nMakes me want to lose it\nAnd push it, abuse it\nMisuse it, confuse it\nDestroy the fucking truth\nWith the means of the [?] fight (story)\nSomebody took the life\nOf my dawg that was tight (man fuck that!)\nWith me and now I can't see you\nBut I'll see you in [?] fourteen\nBelieve it homie\nBest believe, better believe\nI'll be that one muthafucka\nReachin' out to you\n'Cause when I needed help\nI know you'd always come through\n(Yo what up homie?)\nAnd when there was trouble\nYou'd be there on the double\nCrews hittin' you up\nYou claimed Compton on the spot\nNow that's a true motherfucker (that's true)\nNever ranking on the rest\nCarried the weight\nFor the biggest motherfuckers in the West\nSo the Westside will always\nHold a spot for you dawg\nWho knows maybe tomorrow\nI'll get the phone call from the Maker\nThat's got me written down on the paper\nSaying yo it's time to roll\nLike a California shaker! (aw hell nah!)\nNo lie dawg\nIt's gonna be like old times\nWe'll take two to the head\nAnd tell you all about Akwid\n\n[Hook: Ak and Wikid]\nMy boy said no tears when I die\nHomies don't cry\nKeep the party going\nSo it make me come alive\nPump the music loud\nShakin' up the crowd\nStomp your fuckin' feet\nSo I can feel my boys round\nNo tears when I die\nHomies don't cry\nKeep the party going\nSo it make me come alive\nPump the music loud\nShakin' up the crowd\nStomp your fuckin' feet\nSo I can feel it through the ground\n\n[Verse 2: Wikid]\nOh how I wish you was here! (damn!)\nI never expected\nTo lose some homies out the blue\nWe gon' ride for you Flu\nI'm talking 'bout\nThem real G thugs and hustlas\nIn my life who defined the word triflin'\nDamn Keek, I never thought I'd be sittin' here writin' shit\nOn how you just disappeared\nIt seems like just yesterday\nWe was pimpin' all them hoes\nAnd you let me know on how it goes\n'Cause I learned nothin' but the game from ya\nAnd how to be a real muthafucka\nWho could hand your own balls to ya\nIt's fucked up I didn't even make it your funeral\nEy dawg I didn't know\n'Cause if I did\nI'd grab a spray can and write\n'Here lies the truest Ese\nIn Compton that ever lived'\nHere's what we did\nNo tears and no cryin'\nJust a little head shakin' and sighin'\n(Yo check this out homie)\nI know you wouldn't want it any other way\n'Cause you still the third member 'til today\nSo I'ma crack a toast for those who ain't here\nI miss you! I see you when I get there\n\n[Hook: Ak and Wikid]\nMy boy said no tears when I die\nHomies don't cry\nKeep the party going\nSo it make me come alive\nPump the music loud\nShakin' up the crowd\nStomp your fuckin' feet\nSo I can feel my boys round\nNo tears when I die\nHomies don't cry\nKeep the party going\nSo it make me come alive\nPump the music loud\nShakin' up the crowd\nStomp your fuckin' feet\nSo I can feel it through the ground\n\n[Bridge: AK]\nNo tears dawg\nJust like you wanted\nAnd I wanna say something man\nI wanna tell you I really wish you were here\n\n[Verse 3: AK]\nReminiscing all the shit that you did for me\nComin' through for your crew\nReal true, now that's cool\nNever knew but you still had my back\nThat's fat, looking out for your boys\nOn the Southside of Cali\nHave it your way, it's your song\nFor the warrior in you\nYou took a piece of me dawg\nAlways ride for you\nI know you live within me\n'Cause I can see you in the [?] glue\nMuch love Kiko, rest in peace, this one's for you\n\n[Verse 4: Wikid]\nEyyo peep this homie\nThis shit here is all for you\nAnd nothing but respect from my crew\nAnd I can never give it right\nSo I'ma sit here and write\nAll my tears\nAnd let loose with no fears (listen)\nYou gonna always be the only man\nI ever bowed down to for no reasons\nAnd let me give you all my thanks\nFor showing me the way of life\nThat's gonna take me to the banks\n\n[Hook: Ak and Wikid]\nMy boy said no tears when I die\nHomies don't cry\nKeep the party going\nSo it make me come alive\nPump the music loud\nShakin' up the crowd\nStomp your fuckin' feet\nSo I can feel my boys round\nNo tears when I die\nHomies don't cry\nKeep the party going\nSo it make me come alive\nPump the music loud\nShakin' up the crowd\nStomp your fuckin' feet\nSo I can feel it through the ground", "title": "No Tears", "album": "2002 A.D."}], "artist": "Akwid"}
