Would you cry?\nAh, thought so, I do sometimes..\nSee you have a home and a swimming pool, the big backyard (yeah?)\nLarge living room, fed with a silver spoon\nYou probably sinning too but don't know\nPardon me if I'm offending you but I won't go\nI question my faith, been in a depressional state (yeah man)\nSelf-hate, one day blessings will wait\nStared death in his face, planning my 'scape\nI've seen D's stretching out tape\nI've 'visioned prison dates, injected with the venom of snakes\nWomen with grapes, slept with in rooms pyramid-shaped\nWalls covered with hieroglyphics, I'm far from religious\nIt was said in my first introduction\nWhich was Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\nFor me it went deeper than just reading a verse\nSeeing it first, I needed work\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Killah Priest]\nYou know it's real, K.P\nThe picking cot had been lockened\nDaily.."}]}
