That's hello in Spanish\nMy name is Danny Sexbang and I'd like to welcome you to Ninja Sex Party's sixth album, Cool Patrol!\n\nCan you believe it's been six albums already?\nWhy, it seems like only yesterday that I single-handedly started this two-person band all by myself\nAnd definitely not with Ninja Brian, whoever that is...\n\nAnd now we have four original and two cover albums to our name\nWith all this stuff under our belt, it seems that we've really come far\nIndeed, we've come farther and faster than anyone could've expected us to come\nShooting our luscious jams all over your body, year after year after year\nAnd no matter how hard you try to wipe those last remaining notes off your perky... you know what?\nI need to be alone for a minute\nSo please enjoy Cool Patrol!\n\nOh god!"}], "artist": "Ninja Sex Party"}
