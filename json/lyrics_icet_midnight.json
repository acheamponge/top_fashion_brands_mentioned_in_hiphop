Our back window\nWas removed by a shotgun\nNow Hen G was shot\nDon caught a ricochet\nThese motherfuckers was ill\nThey didn't come to play\nBust a right turn, parked\nAnd then we got left\nHid in the the bushes\nShot the gas tank to fake death\nBut would this really\nKeep them psyched?\nThree of us bleedin'\nIt was ten past midnight!\n\nI really didn't like\nHow this shit was goin' down\nWrong night, wrong time\nWrong fuckin' part of town\nYa see we was deep\nIn the Hoover's hood\nThree niggas bleedin'\nThat shit don't look good!\nSee over there red don't go\nSome places red's all they know\nBut not our luck\nTonight we was real fucked\nBroke down an alley\nAnd we instantly had to duck\nFuckin' police on a gang sweep\nNo time to deal with one time\nSo we had to creep\nBroke through a back yard\nRan through a vacant lot\nE, Hen and Don kept up\nTo be some niggas shot\nShit was gettin' crazy\nSo I had to get busy\nHen was bleedin' worse\nAnd Evil was gettin' dizzy\nLooked in a parking lot\nI needed a snatch bar\nHad to hot wire\nSo I moved on an old car\nIt was a bucket, but fuck it, it had to do\nStarted it up\nAnd scooped my whole crew\nTwo blocks later\nWe saw fuckin' blue lights\nThe pigs were behind us\nIt was half past midnight!\n\nWhen they pulled us over\nShit got worse\nI waited till they got out\nAnd then I hit reverse\nFucked 'em up, I seen one cop fall\nThrew it in gear, yo I'm outty y'all\nDon't know how\nBut somehow we got away\nLost the jackers, the cops\nDumped the G.T.A\nMade it back to the hood\nFixed the crew up\nAnd even though Evil's car blew up\nWe made it home and then I crashed out\nThinkin' bout my all-night death bout\nThen somethin' woke me up\nFrom my dark sleep\nThe sound of fuckin' police\nWhen they're tryin' to creep\nBroke through my door\nWith no goddamn warning\nLooked at my watch\nIt was six in the mornin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8ba43671bb57813daf61c8431aebd0ea.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "O.G.
