"[Intro]\nAt this time, please extinguish all smoking materials\nReturn all seat backs, and tray tables\nTo their most upright, and long position\nAlso at this time please take care to fasten your seatbelt\nEnjoy your stay, welcome to L.A\n\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nSex power and wealth, fuck everything else\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nTrying to survive, Los Angeles Times\n\n[Verse 1]\nMC's get fucked up, chopped like Braveheart\nDon't start what you can't finish, serious bidness\nDown La Cienega to bust a left on Venice\nWhere you can find me and mines -- Los Angeles Times\nWelcome to L.A\nWhere every other day I'm taking the hat off my head\nGivin respect to the dead, and avoid havin the same thing\nSaid about me, Xzibit stand underground\nLike the roots of a tree, watered three times a day\nForty ounce Olde E, like a magnifying glass\nMaking it easier to see, the Mister X to the Z\nDon't P, L.A., why test without vest-es\nStop lead projectile, Apocalypse Now\nLove Allah not new car, faggot, superstar\nType of cat, fuck that, mash away in a\nDiamond-white Concours 'Llac\nStill black so the one-time react as if under attack\nAin't nothin changed but district range, feel no pain\nMr. Big Bad Insane Black John McClane with\nLiquor on the brain, down to earth like dirt\nFrom the city where niggas known for puttin in work\n\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nSex power and wealth, fuck everything else\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nTrying to survive, Los Angeles Times\n\n[Verse 2]\nWelcome to L.A\nIf hand determine dick size, I'm palmin the Earth\nSelect turf, then plant bad seed and give birth\nAnd make the hard work look easy fuh sheezee\nLeavin you and your best man, stiffer than mannequins\nEnough to break the skin on a Vietnam leatherneck\nMarine drill sergeant, you nothin but a target (pow!)\nCharge it to the game, gotta look beyond the brand name\nComin from the guts like I slammed down twenty cups\nOf Hennesey straight, relate feel my hate\nXzibit flippin through these bitches like DJ trait\nTranslate to left field, only real niggas follow\nBitches suck and swallow, I'm livin life behind the bottle\nNever the role model, still shinin like a new automobile\nFlow six-fo', you can't steal\nCause I got a kill switch with a itch for the action\nWhile other rappers use mass weapons of destruction\nTo sell they shit\n\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nSex power and wealth, fuck everything else\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nTrying to survive, Los Angeles Times\n\n[Verse 3]\nEl ve-te-rano, you can only pray to learn what I know\nRide slow across the horizon a lone desperado\nComin through the door bringin nothin but hits\nSometimes I feel like a matador, lookin at this bullshit\nNiggas pull rent from the crack of they ass\nMaintain do your thang this too shall pass\nI season beef with lead pieces then cook it with gas\nI'm from the school of hard knocks way ahead in the class\nXzibit hard to get through, like bulletproof glass\nBreak it down like Johnny Cochran then mix it with hash\nYour defense can't last against advanced prosecution\nHit the airwaves like pollution -- hey, here's a solution\nTake a trip to Washington then burn the Constitution\nTop government officials locked down for prostitution\nRecruitin the hard rocks mean streets keep producin\nThe world is a riot shit is mine for the lootin\n\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nSex power and wealth, fuck everything else\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nTrying to survive, Los Angeles Times\n\n[Bridge]\nEveryone's got to make a living\nEveryone's got to make a living\n\n[Chorus]\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nSex power and wealth, fuck everything else\nWelcome to L.A, where you can see the whole city burning\nCause the cops got uzis and the dealers keep serving\nAnd your kids ain't learning shit, except this\nTrying to survive, Los Angeles Times\n\n[Outro]\nEnjoy your stay, welcome to L.A"}],
