Uh... What aren't I?\nWho's constantly in war inside? Me, myself, and my pride\nThey all stressin', but thoughts not restin'\nCuz I can't let it all fall apart like it's sections\nThere's aggresion, depression, hella second guessin'\nI'm feelin' like I'm mind blown, thoughts are at a dead end\nPop says correction, Mom says a revered\nShe know I won't listen but still she throws the suggestion\nI played mental Tekken so all of this is a blessin'\nI was lost on the road and finally found a direction\nFuck with anybody, think I'm lovin' the progression\nStill they say I'm immature like a bored freshman\nThey got no idea that I was really destined\nThey got no idea that I was really destined\nI continued on my path and my mind as my weapon\nI walked through hell, now I'm inventin' the heaven, cuz...\n\n[Hook]\nYou ain't got no idea\nIf you thinkin' that this boy about to cower in fear, nah\nYou ain't got no idea\nCuz I done been through a lot in these 15 years\nYou ain't got no idea\nSaid I done been through a lot, still I ain't show tears\nYou ain't got no idea\nSaid you don't know how I see it, you don't know how I see it"}], "artist": "Bishop Nehru"}
