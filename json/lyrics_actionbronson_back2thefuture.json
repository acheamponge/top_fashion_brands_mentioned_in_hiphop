{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Back 2 The Future]\n\nYo all I need is just a snippet of the orchestra\nBut now we rockin' leathers and my team is dippin' porches\nTrained in special forces\nI remain the same\nModel in the rugby, with the horses in it\nI'm lookin' gorgeous on it\nA light gallop\nThe suit is seersucker, like a scallop\nCop the land and over time you see the price pile up\nMy life style the dreams of money though it feels nostalgic\nIt's sunny skies and good karma that keeps the cheese surrounding\n\n[You'd be astounded motha' fucka]\n\nI'm known to kick it like I'm Ronaldinho\nMy rhymes are spicy as a jalape\u00f1o\n'87 fine Yovino\nCash the drift\nOne leaf wrap up the reefer\nNow the vision seems clear\nJust like the cover on the beeper\n010, 7:15, month of July\nShorty blowing on my dick\nMy eyes closed, smoke in the sky\nExhale right through my nose\nNorth bound, headed for gods\nFirst check, a quarter mil\nHalf that split with the squad, kid\n\n(Bronson talking)\nIt's like, I don't even know which way to go no more man\nJust reflecting on my life now\nI gotta get with it\nYo\n\nDeep reflection, smoking drug as the wind blow\nAsh the $50 marijuana out the window\nMy golden aura shine, rising past the borderline\nI crush the grape like a Greek to make the gorgeous wine\nOpen the Dutch and let tobacco fly through the wind\nThe saga begins\n.38 plugs, vivid like photography lens\nSoon to see me dip mahogany Benz\nI'm in the quality, monogamy with all if my gems\nThat means I'm - true to it\nThe beat, I give the flu to it\nOr maybe AIDS if I had it, cause I'm a fuckin' addict\nI'm on the terrace drinkin' wine and eatin' fuckin' rabbit\nTo cleanse the palate, lemon segments tossed up in the salad\nSpark the pepper, my mind is like a Harvard lecture\nBronsalini going Persian on the carpet texture\nAncient Roman on the architecture\nStraight outta' motha fuckin' queens\nMy team, we got the heart to wet ya'\nA Dutch master like Robben and Sneijder\nStrike like a viper\nThe bottom of shoe tap like a type writer\nPipe slider, I'm a fuckin' ninja warrior\nWe do the drug and eat \u0107evapi in Astoria\nI ride zebras all through the jungle\nTake rock and never fumble\nShoot gun right from the waist\nSlide piece to make it mumble\nOn the come through\nSeveral grams are stuffed inside the grundle\nSaw the goal line\nWent airborne and did a tumble\nAnd I landed on my feet for two G's\nAnd pressed the sand\nWipe the sweat right off my brow\nNext door dig up the lamb\nThat's been roasting over 7 hours\nBronsalini smoke the deadly sour\nI'm fuckin' winning like I'm Kenny Powers", "title": "Back 2 The Future", "album": "The Program EP", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d65e5b40880a23c9f6638fd1a8173306.800x800x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
