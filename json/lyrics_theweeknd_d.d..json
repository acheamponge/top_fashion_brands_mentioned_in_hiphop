Oh no... Oh no...\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town\nEvery musician's fan after the, curtain comes down\nShe waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige\nWho promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree\nShe's saying that's ok, hey baby do what you want\nI'll be your night lovin' thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt\nAnd I don't care what you say, I want to go too far\nI'll be your everything if you make me a star\n\n[Hook]\nDirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, no\nDirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, let me be!\nOh no... Oh no... Oh no...\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe said I have to go home cause I'm real tired you see\nBut I hate sleepin' alone, why don't you come with me\nI said my baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight\nI didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright\nDiana walked up to me, she said I'm all yours tonight\nAt that I ran to the phone sayin' baby I'm alright\nI said but unlock the door because I forgot the key\nShe said he's not coming back because he's sleeping with me\n\n[Hook]\nDirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, no\nDirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, let me be!\nOh no... Oh no... Oh no...", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/dncafws9usq8zvqlzr3k1fwby.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Echoes of Silence", "title": "D.D."}]}
