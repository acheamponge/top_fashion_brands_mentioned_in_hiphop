{"songs": [{"lyrics": "Concerts are pretty much performance art with the venues changed. And, and just by, by, by nature of the venues the performance change, right? You in a smaller venue it\u2019s a bit more intimate so you get to feel the, you know, the energy of the people\n\nIn a concert, especially a large concert all of that energy comes to you, like, what do you do with that energy? You know so today it\u2019s kind of, it\u2019s kind of, an exchange. You have some way to drop it back off, you know\n\nWhen art started becoming part of the galleries. There became a separation between culture. And even in hip hop, people were like, almost like, art is too bourgeois. We\u2019re artists we\u2019re alike, we\u2019re cousins, that\u2019s what really exciting for me: bringing the worlds back together\n\nI try not to have any expectations going into a performance. I try to just let it happen, just get into the moment and, you know, whatever happens happen", "title": "Picasso Baby: A Performance Art Film", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf0f68ee56f29c8542ad805c6419682b.676x676x1.jpg", "year": null, "album": null}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
