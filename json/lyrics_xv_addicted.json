Yes\nLike Sasha Fierce? No\nShe exposing her breasts, her nipples pierced though\nI told her, \"Take off your top and do it real slow\"\nI give her credit like she acting in a film role\nI'm taking stills of her standing still, still clothed\nAnd by clothed I mean robed, spread eagle and expose like yoooo\n\n[Hook]:\nI'm addicted to you\nYour my addition\n\n[Verse Two]:\nThis here is dedicated to celebs, pics on Perez\nDon't get mad shit, let's celebrate it\nMy girl Robin was sobbing I told her \"drop it\"\nDon't worry about these R&B niggas, baby I got 'em\nGood Girl Gone Bad\nSo she ain't got no problem taking pics of her ass\nAnd make sure that you palm it\nDamn\nAnother nipple ring?\nThat must be the new in thing\nVizzy keep girls screaming, the new N'SYNC\nNo homo like dudes in pink\nCassie baby you cool, but Rihanna finer\nSaid she would have done full body but couldn't find the time of\nSo she used a mirror, panties on looking decent\nSo wet the pictures just started leaking\nHa, oh\nAnd shouts to Mike Wax\nAnd all the camera phones and girls who like that\nCause\n\n[Hook]:\nI'm addicted to you\nYour my addition"}], "artist": "XV"}
