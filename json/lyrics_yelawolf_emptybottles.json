(2, 3, 4)\n\n[Hook]\nEmpty bottles on the table\nBlack roses on the ground\nSilhouettes of people dancing\nTo an unfamiliar sound\nHello stranger, can I call you a friend?\nMy friend, I'm going down\nWith empty bottles on the table\nBlack roses on the ground\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh, what a life it's been\nWhat about my life and then?\nWhat about the what and whens?\nIf's, maybe's, could-have-been's?\nYou didn't know shit about me, man\nYou didn't go to school in the clothes that I had to wear back then\nLook at you, fucking faggot, what you looking at, punk?\nWhat, bitch? Give me another shot, hey, what you want?\nMake it a double, fuck it, a triple, fuck it, give me the bottle\nAnd then it's bottoms-up, what a positive role model\n\n[Interlude: Shawty Fatt]\nHey wolf, wolf!\nCome on man, time to go\n\n[Bridge]\nWake up in the morning feeling like I'm not awake at all, take a Tylenol, shake it off\nWanna take another shot of Jack but Jack D shot me with a sawed-off\nWake up in the morning feeling like I'm not awake at all, take a Tylenol, shake it off\nWanna take another shot of Jack but Jack D shot me with a sawed-off\n\n[Hook]\nEmpty bottles on the table\nBlack roses on the ground\nSilhouettes of people dancing\nTo an unfamiliar sound\nHello stranger, can I call you a friend?\nMy friend, I'm going down\nWith empty bottles on the table\nBlack roses on the ground\nEmpty bottles on the table\nBlack roses on the ground\nSilhouettes of people dancing\nTo an unfamiliar sound\nHello stranger, can I call you a friend?\nMy friend, I'm going down\nWith empty bottles on the table\nBlack roses on the ground", "title": "Empty Bottles"}]}
