I mean, what else are you? You know, you\u2019re always\u2026you\u2019re always just the reaction to the bad parts of yourself, I think. And I think that\u2019s what is kind of like, a driving motivation behind any human being that\u2019s\u2026who wants to continue to grow and live life. \u2018Cause they\u2019re looking at their flaws and trying to, go beyond it. And I think that a person, you know, essentially dies when they think that they found themselves, ya know? Unless you want to admit that you, yourself, are not an individual, and are just part of a whole\u2026movement of ideas, and thought, and culture, and humanity and, furthermore, the universe, and everything -- unless you really feel like that, and you\u2019re walking through walls, you know, you are always trying to find yourself. And it\u2019s usually a person who believes that they\u2019ve found \u201cthe answer\u201d -- found \u201cthe end\u201d -- that there actually is a psychological end. And then what\u2019s the point of, you know, doing anything after that?", "album": "Flowers For My Father"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
