I need that\nHe say he out here in the field then show me that\nMan these niggas not forreal man, I'm knowin' that\nAnd watch my set I'm from the Lam go nuts, and watch they fall back\nNiggas ain't never did shit for me, looked out or none of that\nNow how the fuck do you expect for me to look out for em' back\nPut 300 on my back, I'm a runningback\nNow how the fuck do you expect for me to look out for em' back\n\n[Verse 1]\nDoing me that's where it's at, no sneak dissin' none of that\nAt the top that's where we at, yall beneath us that's where yall at\nOld niggas talking bout them old racks but where they at?\nAnd if he holding old racks we running in, now where they at?\nSame hood same niggas, this where we at\nLook out for my family man, fuck the rest\nAnd if you with me then you with me man, fuck the rest\nHead shots when we aiming man, fuck a vest\n\n[Hook]\nI heard he holdin', on the low.. I need that\nHe say he out here in the field then show me that\nMan these niggas not forreal man, I'm knowin' that\nAnd watch my set I'm from the Lam go nuts, and watch they fall back\nNiggas ain't never did shit for me, looked out or none of that\nNow how the fuck do you expect for me to look out for em' back\nPut 300 on my back, I'm a runningback\nNow how the fuck do you expect for me to look out for em' back\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn the streets I got my heat, man I'm on that can't tell me shit\nI been gettin' money and niggas hatin, that shit don't make sense\nI'll drop a nigga hit a stain or two, run that I need this\nAnd this my life, I don't give a fuck about no diss\nAnd you better stay your distance cause we packin' with that shit\nI'm ballin hard like K.D. fourth quarter I can't miss\nYoung nigga and I'm on my own, niggas ain't did shit\nThey hatin' they sneak dissin', most do it over a bitch\nAnd you better not give me one shot, I promise you I ain't gon' miss\nMy niggas with me them my niggas, ain't no new shit\nWe shootin' shit extended clip, take you to movist\nAnd it's 300 fuck the opps, this is the movement\n\n[Hook]\nI heard he holdin', on the low.. I need that\nHe say he out here in the field then show me that\nMan these niggas not forreal man, I'm knowin' that\nAnd watch my set I'm from the Lam go nuts, and watch they fall back\nNiggas ain't never did shit for me, looked out or none of that\nNow how the fuck do you expect for me to look out for em' back\nPut 300 on my back, I'm a runningback\nNow how the fuck do you expect for me to look out for em' back"}], "artist": "Lil Reese"}
