Better practice\nWhile y'all niggas sleeping on that money like a mattress\nI'm living out my dreams, sticking the green like a cactus\nIf money rules the world I want my pockets like an atlas\nCouldn't even get to my level boy if you mapped it\nHowie knows, I'm the real deal, get a Vlasic\nCause even in the end, I'mma ball, ask a basket\nI got this\nI'm at a different height B\nI can make it reign/rain like May's weather/Mayweather\nSo these lames wanna fight me\nFans think I left, but I was getting right B\nTo find a nigga like me I promise that's unlikely\nI might be\nPlanted in the house, I guess I'm homegrown\nI am in the realest state/real estate\nFeeling like a home show\nBreezing through these women but I'm getting super dome though\nI'm trying to be rich boy, what you think I'm in my zone fo'/Zone 4?\nHatin' while I'm skatin', better know I got a cold flow\nWatch what you say, things might get wild\nSo watch your tone loc/Tone Loc\nI am never slipping, I've been in it for a minute\nIf you didn't know by now boy, I get it, get it, get it\nSo stay up in your lane\nI'm about my game\nDomo arigato is all you gotta say\nMy shoe game's Toronto, all about them J's\nI'm a king like a bronco, this is where I reign\nBatters in the sky\nYeah, I got my name up\nBighead nigga, don't socialize with you lame fucks\nThey was hating on me in the game before I came up\nDidn't want a picture/pitcher, now they want a change up\nI'm beating the beast, you've seen 'em\nRelax, I'm kicking my feet up\nI'm hotter than 20 fevers\nA marching band couldn't beat him\nNo frontin' but I'm the leader\nWinning by several meters\nI'm kicking, I'm ripping, I'm kicking more bars than [?]\n2000\nI'm wowzing\nYou couldn't be above I/eye, homie you're only browsing\nGot the game on lock/Lox the way that I'm always stylin'\nLadies screaming for me now they hoarse/horse just like a stallion\nCall me Robert Townsend\n\n[Verse Two: XV]\nLook\nNow you're in the presence of a winner\nNot a rude house guest, I'm as pleasant as I entered\nAutographing your ticket just so you remember me\nAnd stay in my city, I'm as epic as a center\nChip on my shoulder and a hunch on my back\nSounds like Uncle Fester made it home for dinner\nGrey Pouponing niggas\nPardon me fam\nSonning/sunning them\nLeave 'em with a Pauly D tan\nLife handing me lemons I made some money off it\nSongs started leaking like a fucking running faucet\nI took advice from my homeboy Marcus\nWhen shit get rocky, get high and bungee off it\nGeronimo\nFinally made it, even if my come up was kinda slow\nFor the people that rolled, 40 Days, 40 Nights\nI'm bringing 'em all home on this Squarian flight\nTeacher said I used to be so mean\nBut read those magazines and I'm apparently nice\nWith the shit that I write/right\nOutdid my wrongs\nScared to die but more scared to outlive my songs\nSo I\nDream on aeroplanes bumping Aerosmith\nCheating death and stealing life\nEddie Guerrero shit\nSo you know I gotta spit that habanero shit\nTill I'm in the same place that the Pharaohs went\nVizzy"}], "artist": "XV"}
