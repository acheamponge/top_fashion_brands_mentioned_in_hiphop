No, my life's a gameshow\nI shot for the stars - Miss\nSo now I aim low\n\n[Hook]\nIf you don't hear back from me\nI probably got some shit on my dick and afraid the doctor gonna laugh at me\nI'm just playin, peeranoia fucks with the mind\nThis hook is stuck in my cheek\nLet me pull it out for real this time\n\n[Hook]\nYo, if you don't hear back from me\nIt's probably cause my record flopped and my life is a catastrophe\nYo, if you don't hear back from me\nIt's probably cause them doctors with hypodermics are still after me\nYo, if you don't hear back from me\nIt's probably cause I'm dead to the world, literally or atrophy\nYo, if you don't hear back from me\nIt's probably cause I ran off with a band and shot me up with some smack for free\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got a little buzzed\nI went a little crazy\nSaid everything I said on Movies because of my buzz\nI lost my brain before I rap\nNo allowance, fake sneakers, walked into a world of crack\nSold pieces for Pumas, gold, and Nike's\nWalked and talked like a rapstar\nBut was white, and did it right\nBefore girls, the acne came\nI had a fade, spittin some Epmd-meets-Big Daddy Kane\nUnlike the judge who cracked his hammer gently\nSent me to be evaluated, and the hospital kept me\nI came home to make music weirder than De La's\nBut Bobbito knew I was butters like Professor Chaos\nTurned into hours of blank cause my memory bank\nIs crawlin with skanks like Hillary Swank\nNo disrespect, but your name rhymed homie\nUntil my final destination, Death can blow me\n\n[Hook]\nIf you don't hear back from me\nIt's probably cause my record flopped and my life is a catastrophe\nIf you don't hear back from me\nIt's probably cause some doctors with hypodermics are still after me\nIf you don't hear back from me\nIt's probably cause I'm dead to the world, literally or act to see\nIf you don't hear back from me\nIt's probably cause I ran off with a band and shot me up with some smack for free\n\n[Cage]\nI climbed through dirt to get my name known and shit\nWhen I jumped on the track like rainbow and spit\nThis party's goin to hell with blunts to the def\nYaking on Mu's roof while he's wavin guns to his guest\nDon't pass that shit\nDon't throw me a lighter\nI put more flakes behind my face than Tony the Tiger\nI wasn't hearing what I said, left my ear on the stage\nPuked up on a fan, the last of incoherent Cage\nDidn't quit PCP, it quit me\nReality rolled me up, took 2 puffs, then clipped me\nI snitched on a drug and got away lovely\nTold em Johnny Dip from Hell, cops at 21 Dump St\nYou talk tough, then why you shaking like maracas\nPut a gun in your hand, you won't murder like B.A. Baracus\nI need a new drug to make me ok\nAnd a place to keep my shit when they come to take me away"}]}
