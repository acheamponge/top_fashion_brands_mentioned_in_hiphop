(chop chop)\nSo then we let the machetes coup de grace\n200 million barrels a day was all we saw\nOne monkey don't stop one show (no way)\nBack in business, see that pipeline knocked? I control the flow\nLet Switzerland hold the dough\nTel Aviv will grind anything we get out those mines\nGet Washington on the satellite phone, promise a price freeze\nGuarantee the safety of Royal Dutch Shell employees\nIncrease the Mobile Exxon concession\nAnd send our militias more weapons\nPurge the unions, assassinate the students, but keep promising elections\nI don't want to turn on the BBC and see anything about repression\n\n[Hook]x2\nThey fly by in bullet proof Benzes\nGucci aviators with the mirrored lenses\nSipping Champagne in the Seychelles\nLiving like this boy you do get expensive\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe village stands in the midst of\nSuch rapacious pillage we live with\nMurky rivers oil spillage\nAround here it's never dark, we live in the sparks\nPerpetual gas flames look like rusted Olympic torches\nBlack gold medalist on derrick platform surrounded by armed forces\nThe last thing we need is another daughter\nDon't drink the water, don't breath the air\nDon't talk to any reporters, tape recorders\nSpecial forces is the only one with cold beer and fresh vegetables\nKnocking late at night cold fear grips your testicles\nPushing in asking for you her and him\nThey got lots of questions about what you were doing with them\nAnd who told who what when\n\n[Hook]x2"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
