{"artist": "!llmind", "songs": [{"title": "Blow Your Comb Out", "lyrics": "I got the inspiration for this from the classic hip hop group Digable Planets. They were one of my favorites growing up. The name is also inspired by their album \"Blowout Comb\". The drum break I flipped in the intro sounds like something they would rap on, so it just made sense. This one is hard as f*ck. Just that straight grit and bass 808 grime. This sounds like if Dick Tracy was looking to murder someone in the club, and instead of murdering the person, he ends up in the mosh pit with them and they have a dance off. Some wild crazy out there sh!t", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7d06d38d29128523f6bbe2db41628e3f.600x600x1.jpg", "album": "#BoomTrap Volume 4", "year": "2016-07-07"}]}
