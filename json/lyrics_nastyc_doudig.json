Tiga Maine) (Cover) Lyrics\n\n[Chorus]\nAll white jiggy jigga new rockstar boots do you dig it\nI bet a hundred thou there's a ex bitch stalking this minute\nCalvin Klein for my balls never had to wear [?]\nSay she'll never top me off\nBut can she put that on the cross?\nAll white jiggy jigga new rockstar boots do you digg it\nI bet a hundred thou there's a ex bitch stalking this minute\nCalvin Klein for my balls never had to wear [?]\nSay she'll never top me off\nBut can she put that on the cross?\n\nVerse:\nI'm lookin' like I got a deal\nShe never know how I feel\nI Got fresh racks in my luggage\nI'm Tired of hearing your garbage\nShe said she never cut me off\nLike a foreskin son\nYes....I'm all about news\nI'm feelin' like a daily sun\nCan she put that on the cross?\nI don't follow, I'm a boss\nAll white jiggy jigga\nNew rocksta boots do u dig it\nI'm just shittin' ony hoes \nI fuck around withy woes\nI kick em off like Kevin Gates\nNo big deal.....they celibate\nMoonwalk like MJ\nI won't fight for 100K\nWhack style like CJ\nI woke up in my PJ's\nBlack blood in my wine\nLet me act like it's fine\nI'm well known, do you dig it?\nI run a business, do you dig it?\n\n[Chorus]\nAll white jiggy jigga new rockstar boots do you dig it\nI bet a hundred thou there's a ex bitch stalking this minute\nCalvin Klein for my balls never had to wear [?]\nSay she'll never top me off\nBut can she put that on the cross?\nAll white jiggy jigga new rockstar boots do you digg it\nI bet a hundred thou there's a ex bitch stalking this minute\nCalvin Klein for my balls never had to wear [?]\nSay she'll never top me off\nBut can she put that on the cross?"}], "artist": "Nasty C"}
