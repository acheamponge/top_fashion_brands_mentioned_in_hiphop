Lord knows, I got holes in my soul\nBut I would do it all again\nSo what are people mad at me for?\nIs it cause they can't jock my free flow?\nIs it cause they know no matter how hard they go\nThey ain't ever gonna stop my dreams though?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Post Hook]\nSomethin' to sing about\nPut my heart on the line\nPut my life in the song\nNow you, now you, you can sing about me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've been straddlin' the line, all my life, just to get me by\nBut I dreamt of the top, of the sky, dreams of gettin' high\nNow everything I say, they gon' feel it\nEvery words I lay, they gon' hear it\nEvery single word, they gon' get it\n(Let me make sure they remember me)\nI tried, it was hard, but I did it\nCouple more scars, but I'm livin'\nSoon they'll never forget it, never ever forget it, never forget it\n(Let me make sure they remember me)\nAll just survival of the fittest\nAll just to rhyme for the critics\nEverything I want, Imma get it\n(Let me make sure they remember me)\nI tried, it was hard, but I did it\nCouple more scars, but I'm livin'\nSoon they'll never forget it, never ever forget it, never forget it\n(Let me make sure they remember me)\n\n[Hook] + [Post Hook]\n\n[Bridge]\nName across the sky\nAnd put the world upside down\n[?]\nAnd when I'm done with the world, I'm takin' the galaxy\nThey gonna sing about me\nThey gonna sing about me\nThey gonna sing about me\n\n[Hook] + [Post Hook]", "year": "2014-01-01"}]}
