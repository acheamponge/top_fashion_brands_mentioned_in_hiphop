I observe it\nThe way I interpret, you got nervous, heard you spittin' A.I. verses\nThe situation worsens, urban insurgent, Haitians in turbans\nCame with Jamaicans 'n gave it to the merchants\n\n[Verse 3 - Canibus]\nWatch them zombie soldiers, go on put a stank on 'em\nNo thanks partner, run 'em over with some tank armor\nThe drone Can clank clank on 'em\nDrop a little Fat Man on 'em, memorial statue stand on 'em\nElectroactive magnets spin armor to fragments\nGearbox attachments fastened to iron cast caskets\nFantastic, let the Great Gatsby at it\nThe old asthmatic rap addict with the battle rap static\nMetaphor mosaics are made in stages\nWe gave the music industry a Fibonacci facelift\nCowboys and aliens landin' in spaceships\nEvery single nation fightin' off invasion\nWe exodus to the inner labyrinth\nWe follow phosphorescent glowing to a dozen other bases\nWhoever ain't got the muscle to make it, stay here\nWe gon' come back after they shapeshift\n\n[Verse 4 - Born Sun]\nI body ten whales like underwater chemtrails\nOr windsails manufactured out o' they entrails\nUtilize free will on a divine path back to the source\nBut (shape tie?) try to throw me of course\nWhat materialism\nThe physical path, the spiritual depth\nBreak the schism, master the third dimension\nI known him all my life, he my people, he my amigo\nBut my ego is my enemy though\nProof of the sentence, spit out bones, you finished\nTell niggas, open they windows, burn some incense\nFor instance, act off instinct\nTalk to the sphinx, do statistic, my music is mystic\nThen Mother Nature know I'm talkin' to her\nFor those seekin' the cure, I breastfeed a leash to the core\nPisspoor, spit the raw for y'all\nFifth element adds on when I get four\nPeace\n\n[Outro - Unknown Male]\nWhat I think we've come to and what I think the tragedy clearly demonstrates; is that we now find ourselves in a world in which the arrangements of power can not yet be ignored, but in which the instruments of power no longer work. If this lesson has been told us, that the stubborn little gorillas out there, who sawed off the American giant at the knees and brought him down almost like David versus Goliath would have done a great service not only to their own cause -whatever one may think about it- but perhaps to the cause of world peace, and perhaps..."}]}
