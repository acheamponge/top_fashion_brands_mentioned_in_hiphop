Nobody, that's a joke\nThat's why coats get blood soaked for pound notes\nThat's most of the reason niggas bleeding from gun smoke\nIt's all of the reason that a twelve year old sell coke\nThat's why mum's stressed out, that's why niggas stretched out\nIf you stackin' cake, we'll break in your house, tape up your mouth\nTake the spouse, where's the cash?\nGive me the work or the cash, or you gettin' clapped\nYou can be the king of the track, or rap, niggas is rash\nLong as you black you can get jacked, that is a fact\nI never really been rich but I know one thing that won't change\nNever let a man that bleed the same take my chain\nI feel raped, I buss it, fuck it\nI couldn't rest knowing the man took what's mine and I did nothing\nHow I run it, I done stuck a few in my days\nBut I'm still here so fuck it, party away\nGet paid, get laid, get a house with a maid\nGive back to those that was raised how you was raised\nWhoever said life ain't about stackin' paper?\nThey a fuckin' idiot, and they need to wake up", "year": null, "album": "The War Mixtape", "image": "https://images.genius.com/85a1a9e929a1b07df16e80960429050f.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
