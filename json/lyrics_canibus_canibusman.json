I use to say it just like that\nMaybe I should copyright that, I'll be right back\n(Pause)\nSorry to leave you hangin\nI write things down quick cuz I ain't takin no chances\nThats the difference between you and me\nYou a wanna-be, and I'm an MC\nI'm just in the booth right now\nI'm just kickin it with you right now\nI'm tellin you the truth right now\nYou can't fuck with the Canibus man, you can't fuck with the Canibus man\n\n[Canibus]\nNow in this rap field, I got a lot of confirmed kills\nI put niggas through drills to prove if they got true skills\nYou coulda sold millions, but if you ain't got 100 bars shut the fuck up\nAt least don't talk to me, cuz I ain't hearin you\nIf you that ill, give me a hundred bars, I'm darin you\nI definitely ain't scared of you\nI go to war cuz I'm prepared to lose\nJust as long as I get to damage you\nTake the mic from you, then put a knife in you\nThat's what I like to do, make you lose a pint or two\nIf you a lion I'm a tiger too\nI could be as nice as you, but if you a snake I'm a viper too\nLook you in the eyes and lie to you\nThinkin about all the possible ways to kill you while I smile at you\nYou like to get fly nigga I'm a pilot too\nDon't even try to get deep cuz I'm a diver too\nDon't try to fit in my shoes cuz you can't\nNobody can fuck with the Canibus man, understand?\n\n[Canibus]\nYo, yo, yo, my mouth is mechanically mechanized\nMy verbal weapon fires a whole clip of rhymes before you can get off one round\nCan-I-Bus will buss ya, apply enough pressure to crush ya, I pulverize mother fuckers\nLeave MC's laid out like hurricane debris, 15 Megatons of TNT\nThe overseas block busta, bustin up blocks like the Tiguska meteorite to hit Russia\nComin from the underground I discovered\nA ground underneath the ground before underground bunkers\nDedicate it's blunkers, deeper than the labrith\nConductin excavations of the matrix\nLiving in uninhabitable places, craters of a desert like oasis with a cydonian faces\nAs barren as Las Vegas, as barren as the wombs of women who use artificial insemination\nAs barren as Utah's Salt Lake City basin, as barren as ancient Egypt before irrigation\nA five-star chef makin mouth-watering creations with blood stains on my apron\nPut the heads of wack MC's in my oven and bake them\nThen garlic bread sticks in their eye sockets and taste them\nIt's not really that odd, when you consider part of the ancient culture loves to eat dogs\nFeline cats with their claws, paws and all\nCaucasians eat frogs, African-americans eat the hog\nHindus in India will kneel to the floor and worship cows and rats as gods\nI raise the odds, spit rhymes towards Mars and beyond to the nearest binary star\nI'mma tell you once more my main man, you can't fuck with the Canibus man"}]}
