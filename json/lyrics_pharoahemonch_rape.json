It was an instinct\nI would inhale eighths\nSniff that, sat her ass all over my face to taste it\nTo hell with 1980 remixes, fuck disco\nTurned on the 3000, stuck my dick where the disc go\nYokonaz, ripped the sexy MPC 60\nBuying a ticket to hell, verbally dicking the 12 down\nSound shitty, I knew she used to be gritty\nToo many impotent emcees in this God-forsaken city\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't fucking it right, ain't fucking it right\nThey ain't fucking it like me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nConsider this, loops are similar to clitorises exposed\nOn your miss is a hole, a vicious cycle of sin\nThat doesn't end 'til I stop fuckin'\nA million emcees and they ain't saying nothing\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't fucking it right, they ain't fucking it right\nThey ain't fucking it right, they ain't fucking it right\nThey ain't fucking it right, they ain't fucking it right\nThey ain't fucking it like me", "year": "1999-10-19"}]}
