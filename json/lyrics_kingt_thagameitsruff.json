(Compton, Compton)\nRough... (oooooh)\nIt's rough... (it's so rough)\nRough... (Compton baby)\n\n[King Tee]\nLast big baller standing, King Tee loco\nSimply down the Hennessey while others snort coca\nJust tryna live my life like a G supposed ta\nMash in something brand new, breaking off the corner\nI went another route, there's so many claiming killer\nAnd ballers what it's all about? Getting all the scrilla\nAll these haters in the world wanna try to kill ya\nSo if you're strapped at all costs, playboy I feel ya\nI've been around the world through every hood scoping\nYoung Gs just drowning in the game soaking\nPuffing hydro, tryna hold it in but choking\nSteady locing, not too many plans spoken\nNever let your left hand know what your right hand got\nPlay a move for staying on top, the hustle don't stop\nAnd some of y'all can't get enough\nBut your homie King Tee's here to put you up\nThe game is rough\n\n[Hook: Playa Hamm * vocoder voice effect] {X2}\nIt's rough... (you can get some when you need some)\nIt's rough... (but if you take some you better leave some)\n\n[King Tee]\nPart two of the game deals with the ladies\nStick they ass out when they see my big Mercedes\nOr you could ride, then I'mma turn you out baby\nHaving you dancing at the coast, drunk, looking crazy\nBut some fellas fall victim to your player clutch\nGot your fingers full of ice, ain't never fucked\nAnd I ain't the type to like fight and tussle\nAnd like that nigga Jay-Z, I +Can't Knock Your Hustle+\n\n[Playa Hamm]\nStill ain't no leeway, we play for keeps, P's up\nHookers thinking we gon' ease up? Eat these up\nBust cum and we collected, check it bottom to top\nAll I got for 'em is some jism and a blow pop\nGirls behind my zippers, where I'm keeping what they want\nMaximising in the Aftermath and making it rough\n\n[Hook] {X2}\n\n[King Tee]\nFo' sho' I lace the funk up like a fiend\nUncut, throw it on the triple beam\nIt's on hump, walking, tryna make my cream\nBattlecat, Playa Hamm, oh and I'm the King\n\n[Possibly Battlecat; does not sound like Playa Hamm]\nOh wait excuse me King Tee, I'm like your favourite fan\nAnd that record \"Act a Fool\" was like my favourite jam\nNot to ride your ball sack but where some hoes at?\nTee youse a cold mack\n\n[King Tee]\nPlaya and you know that\nIt's real, here loc, hit this doja\nTry to lock in everything that a nigga told ya\nStay sucker free, come and fuck with me, I'll show ya\nOn dubs with that big V-12 boulder\nShow 'nough, homie it's only full bloom\nConversation straight from the throne\nAnd all my niggas is rich, roll thick and live plush\nAnd we never take these streets for granted cause\nThe game is rough\n\n[Hook] {X2}\n\n[Playa Hamm * vocoder voice effect to end]"}]}
