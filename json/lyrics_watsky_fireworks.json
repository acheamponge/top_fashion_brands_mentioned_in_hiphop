I\u2019m a pale ass pale middle-class straight white male\nI won\u2019t have an alibi the day I fail\nCause if I ever went to jail, Mom would pay my bail\nIn a [boom-boom] heartbeat\nMom and Dad have given me a lot more than a pat on the back\nAnd I gotta thank \u2018em for loving me\nFrom the moment I was strapped in a Volvo car seat\nWhen I needed a pep talk\nI couldn\u2019t remember to wreck shop\nWriter\u2019s block, staring at my laptop desktop\nOr sleeping in my rental in a turnpike rest stop\nShit in storage, living from a suitcase\nThinking \u201cthis is how a silver spoon tastes?\u201d\nCause you can make a dream possible\nBut it\u2019ll never be easy, no matter what you chase\nIf you wanna poke fun then do so\nI\u2019ll do it for you, it\u2019s no crime\nI\u2019m like if the dude from Juno grew a Jewfro and liked to rhyme [OOoooooohhh!!!]\nSo tell me that I\u2019m not a rapper\nTell Rudolph he can\u2019t pull sleighs\nTell Pluto it\u2019s not a planet\nAnd he\u2019ll probably keep spinning in the same old way\nOn and on, every day\nRight around the sun, wanna feel the rays\nYou do it \u2018cause you love it like nothing else in the universe\nAnd fuck it, it\u2019s embedded in your DNA\n\n[Outro Skit]\nBoom! It was really loud. I mean, seriously loud. Boom! Boom! Boom!\nWere you scared?\nI'm probably like... I'm probably like the one who was getting scared like... Ten times... more often... Then anybody else I know!\nI think people that say that they're not scared are lying about not being scared\nYeah... So is people saying that they're not ticklish", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0ed2171f9fa650ff0ccb5bcecb02d6f3.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Cardboard Castles", "title": "Fireworks"}]}
