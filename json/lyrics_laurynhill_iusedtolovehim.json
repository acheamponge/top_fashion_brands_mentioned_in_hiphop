Blige & Lauryn Hill]\nI chose the road of passion and pain (passion and pain)\nSacrificed too much and waited in vain\nGave up my power ceased being queen\nAddicted to love like the drug of a fiend\nSee, torn and confused wasted and used\nReached the crossroad which path would I choose\nStuck and frustrated I waited, debated\nFor something to happen that just wasn't fated\nThought what I wanted was something I needed\nWhen momma said no I just should have heeded\nMisled I bled 'till the poison was gone\nAnd out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I don't\nI used to love him but now I don't\nNow I don't\nI used to love him but now I don't\nNow I don't\n\n[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill & Mary J. Blige]\nFather you saved me and you showed me that life\nWas much more than being some foolish man's wife\nShowed me that love was respect and devotion\nGreater than planets and deeper than any oceans\nSee, my soul was weary but now it's replenished\nContent because that part of my life is finished\nI see him sometimes and the look in his eye\nIs one of a man who's lost treasures untold\nBut my heart is gold I took back my soul\nAnd totally let my creator control\nThe life which was his, the life which was his to begin with\n\n[Chorus]\nNow I don't\nI used to love him but now I don't\nNow I don't\nI used to love him but now I don't\nNow I don't\nI used to love him but now I don't\nNow I don't\nI used to love him but now I don't\nNow I don't\n\n[Outro]\nI used to love him but now I don't\nI used to love him but now I don't\nI used to love him but now I don't\nSee, I used to love him"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
