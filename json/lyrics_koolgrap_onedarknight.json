Rap]\nLast night, got caught in a gunfight, I think it was like\nFour niggas clutchin they burners and bustin\nBut only could see one in sight\nThe one on my right, yo son he like we both got gripe\nHe wanted my life, come at a nigga\nWith a gun and a knife\nHe tryin to make me the wiped out nigga layin up under the white\nBut I ain't tryin to go up in no dark tunnel\nAnd burn to the light\nAnd let myself be one more nigga that just got spun in the night\nAnd done in on sight, and tryin to breathe\nWith one in my pipe\nBut I'm not one of the type, and I'd rather lose all hung on the mic\nThan to be up in the yard receivin CPR\nAt one in the night\nNow I can run and take fllght, but alright, yo son'll be hyped\nAnd I've played mother nature before\nSo yo I'm clappin thunder tonight\nI step right, inside of the street light, my gun it was bright\nSend him to kiss Christ, and let my shit slice\nIn front of him twice\nLet one splice, cause fuckin with price, ain't tryin to be nice\nI want him on ice, no back home\nTo a son and a wife\nHe tried roll dice with real life and got his buns in a vice\nNigga was all enticed to lead his life sheist\nBut none of it's nice\nI peeped shit, and seen his whole click, was runnin in fright\nInstead of comin to fight, get someone to fight\nYou son of a dykes\nWith one in the pipe, I'm aimin to light the one on the right\nThey all deceased, so yo my asspiece\nGet hunted for life\nFour niggas cut down, and I can receive one hundred to life\nUp in a jailcell, that's crawlin with lice\nAnd runnin with mice\nLive trife, fillin appetities with nothin but rice\nSlow biz and no kid's nigs\nStart runnin my wife\nOnly got one life, yo get this fuckin, gun outta my sight\nBack at the house, after midnight\nI'm done for the night"}]}
