Meanwhile, back in the now\nGot a brand new skeleton crew on the move out\nWhen they aren't manning thirty burning cannons stern and bow\nThey are prying shiny metals out your m-m-m-mouth\nOkay, youth wanes old age holler wisdom and disease\nLike the scurvy made his yellow gums bleed\nAnd he was achy from his boots to the feather in his hat\nUntil his quartermaster showed up with a stolen treasure map\nOne look down and lept off the dock\nSee if you can guess where X marked the spot\nThe capital was buried at sea in a cursed cave\nOnly one mile from where he'd seen the mer-mer-mer-maid\nAnchors up, hoist the jolly roger thank you much\nDay and night with his hook hands raised and clutched\nBut see the vitamin deficiency was strong\nSo by the time they bumped into the island he could barely lift his grog\nCrawled off the boat, collapsed in the sand\nPrayers in the air, seashells in his hand\nAnd nary a high tide so grand as the one that put\nThe lady of the lake on dry la-la-la-land\nI wish I could tell you that it ended happy\nPretend like his bones weren't practically snapping\nPretend like her gills didn't dry up and suffer\nBut that's a half-dead pirate and a fish outta water\nNo lie, scout's honor, got a million more\nFrom the burgundy lighting above the shores of whores\nBefore your visions of grandeur go to swell those sails\nRemember dead men tell no t-t-t-tales\n\n[Hook]\n\nDead men tell no tales\n..Dead men tell no tales\n..Dead men tell no tales", "title": "The Harbor Is Yours", "album": "None Shall Pass", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3d6c4d11084714cc67f880d71310d197.288x288x1.jpg", "year": "2007-08-28"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
