It's just you, me, and them\n\n[Verse 2: J Cole]\nNow bring ya ass over here\nA nigga tryna take you home like a souvenir\nOne in a million, girl you lookin' like the new Aaliyah\nAnd ah, I got a thang for ya, I got a thang for ya\nA stewardess and yet you flew the leer\nCause you fly as hell shawty walking through the air\nGame cold like the toes on a polar bear\nAnd ah, I do my thang for ya\nNow baby girl if looks can kill then you catchin' bodies\nHow I'm stretching you, guess no need to go get pilates\nWhen I'm sliding through ya city, meet me in the lobby\nAnd you put that thang up on me like you tryna rob me\nCan I hit it in the morning? while you moaning probably\nGot you sweating now you gettin' wet as a tsunami\nWe can do this all day, treat it like a hobby\nBut if I tell you get to stepping like you Pam and Tommy\nDon't mind me, I put it down\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: J Cole]\nDid I meet you for a reason or for a season\nOr either the night of ya life at the Four Seasons\nWhisper to ya home girls you love Cole World\nCause his flow thorough I give you a few more reasons\nNot because his verse or cause I can buy purse you know\nThe type of shit that your man can only purchase on the first\nAnd not because he faker than turf softer than Nerf footballs\nI got his girl's lip gloss all on my girth\nBecause I'm so clever better than ho-eva\nThe coldest nigga even when wearin' like four sweaters\nWell versed, well rehearsed, the go getter\nThese broke niggas got good dressing and no lettuce (Ahhhh)\nYou would think niggas would know better\nIt's 0-11, you would think niggas would flow better\nI know you so fed up, and so I had to blow and I ain't talking coke header\nI won't let up\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "J.
