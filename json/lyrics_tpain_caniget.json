They ain't drinking\nThese type of things happen all the time\nYou better get yours, 'cause I'm gon' get mine, dime\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nI feel so much better\nI Know I said I\u2019ll never ever drink again, again, again\nBut now I feel like I never had before\nI get out on the floor and show them what it's for\n\n[Hook x2]\nCan I get that 'Tron?
