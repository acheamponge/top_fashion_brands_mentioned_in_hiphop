Karniege and Vast Aire - \u201cDrinks\u201d\n[Emcee(s): Karniege, Vast Aire, and billy woods]\n[Producer(s): DJ Marmaduke]\n\n[Verse 1: Karniege]\nHickory Dickory Dock, what I spit out be hot\nGet buried with rocks trying to mess with my moms\nOr my sister and the missus, they be handling sharp\nObjects.  I\u2019ll be honest: it\u2019d be better to run like\nP. Diddy through streets gritty or suburbian\nMove in a hurry, and, toys, we be herbing them\nMany people scurrying, little characters scrambling\nGhost if it\u2019s mannequin, get backed up in ambulance\nSon needs funds \u2018cause tour dates they\u2019re cancelling\nQuit lip-babbling and not business-handling\nMighty Joseph got heat, others got weak.  Bruh, other than that\nWe got hands and feet techniques that\nDraw fans to us, trying to touch our wears, pushing\nTheir girls to talk to us like, \u201cGo, go, go over there.\u201d  (\u201cOK!\u201d)\n\u201cHug his body and get the autograph.\u201d  By\nThe time he tried to holler, me and shorty just flashed\n\n[Hook: Karniege]\nIt\u2019s like\nStay in the mix like a Kool-Aid drink\nSpilling out hot any time the ink\nTouch the pad then float off paper\nCut through speakers with so much flavor\n\n[Verse 2: Vast Aire]\nYo, I had\nTo tighten up my game \u2018cause CEOs is lame\n(Yeah, yeah) Couldn\u2019t be straight-up?  That\u2019s a shame\nHah.  Mighty Joseph (Mighty Joseph), here\u2019s a close-up\n(Here\u2019s a close-up) with a telegram from the Son of Sam\nI came up without the upper hand.  There\nWas no window to throw piss from the pan, so\nWe smoke endo, counting cake in our hands\nYou fucking up the dice game, taking a chance\nI\u2019ll show you my dice game swinging my lance\nYou\u2019re still standing there, pissing your pants\nI\u2019m that same OG with the dip in my stance\nAiki\u2019, jiu-jitsu, you don\u2019t want to dance (You don\u2019t want)\n(To dance) with the Devil (Hah!).  I\u2019m like Seagal\n(Oh!) But I\u2019m harder to kill\u2014it\u2019s just part of the\nSkill (Haha), and you ain\u2019t even half as ill\nI\u2019m a livewire, metamorph into fire\n\n[Hook: Karniege]\nIt\u2019s like\nStay in the mix like a Kool-Aid drink\nSpilling out hot any time the ink\nTouch the pad then float off paper\nCut through speakers with so much flavor\n\n[Verse 3: billy woods]\nFlex with lines and blow out your loafers\n\u2018Cause I got to get mine like Angolan poachers.  Wild pigs\nStay reaching for holsters, but ours\nWas closer, so now I got a hot pocket from the toaster\nPlus headlining on all wanted posters\nWho needs promoters?  I might end up behind bars\nHopefully the type with coasters.  I know I\u2019m not\nSupposed ta like a Wahhabi reading the\nTorah.  Nine spliffs like Hanukah gifts\u2014pass the\nMenorah.  Nigga, look at your lawyer\nThat cheap suit means you\u2019re going in, duke.  Might as well\nCome to court in Timberland boots, smelling like Tropical\nFantasy and Absolut, argue \u2018til the point\u2019s moot\nCargo sagging, flagging\u2014that\u2019s [?]\nTagging (literally).  Treat the hood like Level 4 of Double\nDragon, cock her legs back in a wood-paneled station\nWagon, leave it to beaver\nI do dirt like a preacher\u2014pleased to meet ya\nThat\u2019s Vast with the meat cleaver just to garnish\nA raw Karniege, got emcees drinking foreign ish\nAnd all they can say is, \u201cGosh darn it\nLook what these broke-ass negroes started\u201d"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
