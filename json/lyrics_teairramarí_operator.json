Oops\nI meant to take him to lunch this afternoon\nNow his pissed off in the worst way\nI hope he gets over this attitude real soon\n\n[Chorus:]\nI guess I did something so wrong...\nCause my baby won't pick up the telephone...\nAnd he ain't even coming home\nAnd it's been so long\n\nSo I say hello operator... hellooo\nCan you put my baby on the line\nSo that we can get together later\nCause I really want to spend some time...\nCause he won't... he won't... he won't... he won't... he won't [x3]\nHe won't answer my call\nCan you put my baby on the line\n\nI was shopping with my my homegals\nDidn't expect him to act so immature\nHe be off in his own world...\nI thought my baby was in so insecure\n\n[Chorus]\n\nMaybe I should send him some flowers or a card\nSome candy or a letter cause his taking it so hard\nI should take him on a Shopping spree\nLet's ball out at the mall\nOut wine him and dine I might as well have me a ball...\n\n[Chorus]"}], "artist": "Teairra Mar\u00ed"}
