You're still not stepping\nTowards the same mic I rocked as soon as I crept in\nCause I been doing this thing for a whole lot longer\nAnd if you wanna rock the spot, you better funk stronger\nKeep on, and I'ma have to unleash\nThe true funk baby that ain't nothing but a beast\nYou need practise. then again, it ain't worth it\nMy brain is a computer so that means I'm word perfect\nBlowin' through the 'hood, just cold knockin' spots off\nGet nothing but a chicken and Nonchalant's got your hot sauce\nPlay your cards right now you sweat the inner city\nI got all the diamonds so hard so plus I got the kitty\nYou still wanna test me, you must be gun simple son\nI kick a funky flow like a bowl of rolled chilli's\n\n(chorus)\n\n(verse 3)\nNow put your mind on the matter, to call your next batter\nI'm knockin' home runs in your ass so what's the matter\nA' take your time cause the funky rhyme blow your mind\nStrut my stuff cause I'm so tuff, and hard to find\nIn this maze of amazement I got you cornered\nCut your dimes and your nickels cause you know your money's spent\nMeanwhile back at the ranch, take a chance\nOn this funky head bob that's gonna make you dance\nNow even the funky chickens who can make up on the twist came in\nBut do the chicken with the twist and you can blend\nPut your eyes on the prize, we gonna take a ride\nSo deep in your soul you got tears in your eyes\nYou blinded by the light, now can you see me\nCause I know that you feel me cause I'm cutting like a knife\nWith the phife, you flow is so weak I call your punk\nYou starvin' for some soul, yo, you need to bite a chunk\n\n(chorus)"}], "artist": "Nonchalant"}
