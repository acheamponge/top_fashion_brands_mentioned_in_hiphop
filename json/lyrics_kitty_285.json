It took all of my power to be\nNo control about how everybody's down for you\nFist up like pound it dude!\nAnd I'll be runnin' off and hidin' in the powder room\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNever bitter, never soundin' rude\nAnd positivity, I milk it like a cow, I moo\nI can get the crowd to move, this is how I get the crowd to move\nNever bitter, never soundin' rude\nAnd positivity, I milk it like a cow, I moo\nI can get the crowd to move, this is how I get the crowd to move\nI'll never get another chance, I wish\nBut all I wanna do is make you dance to this\nMake you dance to this, and all I wanna do is make you dance\n\n[Chorus]\nWe say goodbye, I guess\nI will see you around\nAnd I will clean up my mess\nAnd I'll never weigh you down\nWe say goodbye I guess\nI will see you around\nI will clean up my mess\nAnd I'll never weigh you down\n\n[Bridge]\nI been rubbin' velvet to remember your skin, and\nThe way you tell it, I am hell to be with\nI need another round, I need another town\nI need to get around, I need to block it out\nNeed to block it out, need to block it out, block it out out\nI'll never get another chance, I wish\nBut all I wanna do is make you dance to this\n\n[Chorus]\nWe say goodbye, I guess\nI will see you around\nAnd I will clean up my mess\nAnd I'll never weigh you down\nWe say goodbye I guess\nAnd I'll never weigh you down\nI'll never weigh you down\nI'll never weigh you down\nI'll never weigh you down\nI'll never weigh you down"}]}
