a whole lot of unrest\nWhere is your compassion?\nI don't feel the empathy and nobody is listening\nI'm wasting all my energy\nBut fuck it I'ma bring it back and this time I'll be average\n\nReal shit, just gonna dumb it down\nEh\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat you want a simple rhyme scheme nigga\nDouble cup and never bluffing with some codeine nigga\nPop a molly we should party with some morphine nigga\nWe can do it everyday and turn into dope fiend niggas\nNow your tolerance is up you want the whole thing nigga\nMan you never did that shit when you was younger\nIt was everybody around you, influencing in the way that you looking at it\nStaring in the mirror, just the image of an addict\nYour mind been ravaged by narcotics you been taking\nYou reminisce but everyday you're feeling like a vacant\nMistaking evil people you could trust\nI could tell you right now homie they don't give a fuck and\nNothing's ever enough and no you'll never be satisfied\nYou always want more, that's a fact that will forever remain\nThere is no amount of drugs that will ever mask pain\nMan you gotta keep it moving, try to leave it in the past tense\nLawd\n\nEh, eh, eh\nLawd\nReal shit\nHa, knowledge, nigga\nEh, lawd\nEh, hmph\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou won't find me at the mall\nOh no I'm not trying to ball\nAll that I want is something I can call my own\nYes I've adjusted the tone, leave me alone\nPromise that I'll never change\nI'll stay the same til I'm no longer breathing\nBelieve in the words that I speak are the truth\nYou expected turn water to wine for a skeptic\nLawd, eh\n\n[Outro]\n\"In my head, in my head\"\nThat's how that shit went?\nI wish we could find, I wish we could that version\nIt wasn't-, naw I didn't say what he said, but it was close enough\nI don't even understand what a nigga said on the real record\n[Unintelligible mumbling]\nNo-, nobody in rap says shit anymore, like\nThey just mumble, including myself"}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
