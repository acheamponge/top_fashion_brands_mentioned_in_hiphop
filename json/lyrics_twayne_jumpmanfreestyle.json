You need a application\nI swear we full of bench warmers cause we ain't playin'\nHopped out of the coup\u00e9, I hit the alley hoop\nAll my girls be wetter than a bowl of soop\nI feel sorry if you messin' with my crew\nBall is life, they'll shoot\nThey was hatin' on me just the other day\nSee me flexin', had to look the other way\nSaid I wouldn't make it, now look at they face\nServe boy, they had to catch the wave\nThey sayin', \"Who is Ricky Wayne?\", they thought that I [?]\nMy girl so bad she look like she was Instagram famous\nTell the promoter I ain't comin' through if they ain't payin'\nThey speakin' sign language, what you sayin'?\nBack then they used to diss me\nNow they wanna come hug and kiss me\nCallin' my phone sayin' that they miss me\nBut I ain't tryna talk, I just want a quickie\nI'm goin' in but I don't think they ready\nMy name ain't Wap but I'm 'bout my Fetty\nPull up, all black Chevy\nLike [?] shit gettin' heavy\nI never tell a lie to my own partner\nI made myself a budget, I'm my own sponsor\nThey said that Ricky Wayne turned into a monster\nMy money green like Ninja Turtles, cowabunga"}], "artist": "T-Wayne"}
