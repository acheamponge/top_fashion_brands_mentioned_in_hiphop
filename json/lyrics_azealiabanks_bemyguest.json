You the glitch, and maybe see your bitches quits for ya baby\nBrrat baby\nWho the fuck y'all be?\nGot a lens to the scope, take a chance with the witch AB\nImma aim out the camera, I\u2019ll blam if ya run up\nI'll be damned if a bitch play me, play me\n\n[Sample - Nas]\nNothing gon' stop me now, nothin baby\nWe here now, we here\nIt's your world\nYeah\n\nNothing gon' stop me now, nothin baby\nWe here now, we here\nIt's your world\nYeah\n\n[Verse 2 - Azealia Banks]\nAnd even if you run you know I will catch you\nI whip off in the center, I ask to these gutters with the clips burn 'em you could test me\nGet added to the list,  be my motherfuckin' guest\nWith the magnum or the fifth, I could open up your chest\nI could blacken up your vision\nI could have you layed to rest\nThat could happen in a jiff, nigga\nBetter aim your gun, you know I'm gonna break you\n\n[Sample - Nas]\nDeath threats given by clowns\nI guess\n'Cause I would overcome any task\n\nBe-Be-Be my guest!", "year": "2019-04-09"}]}
