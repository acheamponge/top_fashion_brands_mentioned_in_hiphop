{"songs": [{"lyrics": "I am a universal soldier walkin' in the path of the Math\nAfter the aftermath I'm a still be a soldier in america's blood bath\nLook at it thru the wrath of a universal soldier you could never monitor my\nCraft\nI am not a graft I am a original soldier walkin' in the path of the Math\n\nNow\nYou're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin outside yourself - is\nThat right\nYou're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin' outside yourself - uh huh\nYou're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin' outside yourself - uh 1 2\n\nYou're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin' outside yourself - ooh\n\nWell I scrapes the neighbourhoods lookin' for odd jobs\nIt's hard livin' like God in a world full of bobs\nJohn doe's and jacks joe's and mary mack's\nI guess babylon wasn't made for blacks now was it\nWell it doesn't really matter does it\nCause it be dependin' on the who what why's and the whereabouts\nAnd I'm a nigga that the world don't care about\nMr outsider\nIt's all about bein' a fighter\nUse the guide to open up your mind a little wider\nMy mellow my ace\nMovin' from place to place all a nigga want is a taste\nWorking on the docks wearin' a smock\nI clock in I clock out about 5 o'clock\nI keeps a calm disposition\nSo I won't arouse suspicion\nBut then I know what you're wishin'\nThat you could put a bullet in my head plate w/out all that red tape\nAnd lead me straight to the grave\nYou're either a slave or Jesus got you saved\nOr you don't know how to behave but you're brave\nA mixed up African w/a fingerwave\nAnd the load ain't gettin' no lighter\nEven though I'm in it to win it I'm still a outsider\n\n[Hook]\n\nWell back in the days they told me hip hop pays\nSo I says I strays aways from L.A.'s average\nCause C.k-in' and B.k-in'* was bein' a savage (* refering to Crips and Bloods\nMaybe?)\nAnd M.C.-in' and DJ-in' was bringin' the cabbage\nNow it ain't like a nigga talking hella late in the game\nI'm talkin '80 ace deuce\nNobody think about truce\nNo Menace no Boys In The Hood no Juice\nIt was more like Coolie[sp] High and\nNiggers truly die like they do\nWhen I found out you got to choose your path I knew\nNot red and blue\nThe blackness is true\nMy tactics was new\nThat's when the practice grew and I flew\nI wanted to be a rapper so simple and plain\nFrom Los Angeles city of the big bang theory\nWhere everyone is leery\nNow a whole mess of MC's fear me\nBut it's important everybody hear me\nAs I tell you about the unwanted man who got blunted and took what he can\nAnd he ran\nFrom city to city and town to town\nBouncin' around like he's about to blow the world up\nCause his mind's not dormant anymore his door's ajar\nAnd his jar's full of somethin' else\nNow everyone knows that scarecrows w/velcro hair ain't real\nYeah\nBut if your psyche is likely to be spilled\nAin't no tellin'\nYou'll be sailin' across the seas like Magellan\nWay out your range and since I don't speak greek stranger\nI'm a (?let me?) give it to you in layman's terms so you'll learn\nI paid the piper I'm gon' pick the tune\nBut I don't listen to music like that\nSo\n\nYou're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin outside yourself - is that\nRight\nYou're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin' outside yourself - uh huh\nYou're gettin' outside yourself boy you're gettin' outside yourself - uh 1 2\n\nYou better run and hide yourself boy cause you can't provide for self\n\nInside outside\nThat's what doin' it is all about right\nInside outside inside outside\nThat's what doin' it is all about\n\nNow I'm a outsider but not like ponyboy\nI'm Aceyaloney boy\nAnd I transcend\n?w/both hands in?\nAnd I transfer the answer from w/in\nAnd I strain and I gain the strength to bust a blood vessel\nAs my dirty thoughts mudwrestle in my head muscle\nYou got your lucky charm I know you believe in warlocks\nYou better be keepin' you door locked and bolted\nSay praise the lord as I raise the sword and revolted\nPsychological warfare for the holy\nSmoke your last bowl-y\nYour little ship a capsizes your rap dies slowly\nGot a good old fashion passion for smashin' what they built\nW/no guilt\nAt full tilt\nAt full speed\nAt full blast\nComin' full circle on that ass\nI'm the idealistic realistic mystic from the past\nThat just gets more intelligent\nDon't risk it I'm fast\nBetter get involved don't know how the world revolves and evolves\nAnd solve all that you can solve before your mind dissolves\nNow who kilt (killed) this lion? curiosity\nNow why's the black man dyin'? it's an atrocity\nDoes history really repeat itself or is it phophecy?\nSo until I leave my physical shell there ain't no stoppin' me\nCause I paid the piper\nI'm gon' pick the tune\nBut I don't listen to music like that\nSo\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Mr. Outsider", "album": "All Balls Don\u2019t Bounce", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0a698560532b7c3e70ca27a9e71bd6e8.948x936x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
