Tell me, can you sleep?\nKnowing what you did, just knowing what you did\nTryna run you know, try to hide, I just hope you fucking die\nYou can't run, you know, you can't hide\nFrom real life, it's do or die\nYou can't run, you know, you can't hide\nYou find it hard to sleep at night\n\nGhosts in the dream you afraid to fall asleep (asleep)\nSay you don't believe but you down on your knees\nBut you'll never get an answer (never get an answer)\nBackwoods in my lungs, pocket full of drugs\nFeel like I'm dying but I keep holding on\nYou wake me from my nightmares\n\n[Chorus]\nDie slow for me\nDie slow for me\nDie slow for me\nDie slow for me\n\n[Outro]\nDie for me\nDie for me\nDie for me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f47b5d790efa075451d60caf685ea148.960x960x1.jpg"}]}
