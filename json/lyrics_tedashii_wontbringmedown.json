Man, that sound insane\nLet's go\n\n[Chorus]\nYou never said it would be easy\nBut always said that You'd be with me, yeah\nNo fear, I know You're here\nMy help comes from above\nThings below won't bring me down\nThings below won't bring me down\nThings below won't bring me down\nThings below won't bring me down\nThings below won't bring me...\n\n[Outro]\nYou never said it would be easy\nBut always said that You'd be with me, yeah\nNo fear, I know You're here\nMy help comes from above\nThings below won't bring me..."}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
