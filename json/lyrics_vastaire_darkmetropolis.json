The dark metropolis!\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe Blackman is God is an understatement\nI\u2019m a titan filled with the Holy Ghost when I\u2019m writing\nI\u2019m the wisdom of Solomon and Sheba\nI\u2019m the green giant that builds with the Keebler\nWe can soar to the highest aethers\nWhere Jah will meet ya' and you ain't even have to light the reefer\nSo where we going, heaven or neither?\nI guess we'll find out when we flatline with Kiefer\nI\u2019m surrounded by lost toys\nI know I can't see your reflection you're probably a lost boy\nBlood suckers of the poor lead 'em to hell's door\nAnd the Babylonian whore right there on the floor\nDon't make me come after ya'\nCause' I'll put your face on the grill and lean on the spatula\nIGC is spectacular\nI\u2019m not afraid of Medusa, I just winked back at her\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen I was born my mother had a joyful pain\nAs she said my name I took seven steps and proclaimed\nThe body's the earth the soul is the flame\nAnd the mind is a watery hurricane\nWe in the phantom zone\nAn intedimensional vortex where I spit my poems\nSome of you dudes are drones\nI feel like The Last Starfighter in Attack of the Clones\nAnd I\u2019m ah' let it be known\nThe original man is older than any dinosaur bone\nAnd you're about to get thrown\nI fight like Nubian Moors that pushed back Rome\nI\u2019m at ease with it, I breathe with it\nI\u2019m the true and living God I don't need 'whip-its'\nHere's what you do to achieve it\nYou get yourself a mothership and put the key in it...", "album": "Aireplane", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cda1dc5e94558c12ffcdaf865d093862.720x720x1.jpg"}]}
