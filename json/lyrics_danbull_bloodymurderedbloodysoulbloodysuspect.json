I need help with it\nThrow the laws of physics out the window, go to town with it\nI can walk through substances to suss out who the suspect is\nBut can\u2019t discuss or talk about the subject with them \u2018cause I must exist\nI\u2019m an ethereal, pulp noir serial star\nBut this is real despite appearing immaterial\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nI can\u2019t explain it, I\u2019m on a hunt for the truth\nTo why my assailant made me plummet from under the roof\nSalem is a place containing hundreds of clues\nAnd my presumption is that somewhere in it somebody goofed\n\n[Hook]\nWoke up in a murder scene, a ghost interred in Purgatory\nA dude determined to determine who has murdered me\nWoke up in a murder scene, interred in Purgatory\nA dude determined to determine who has murdered me\nMurder scene, Purgatory\nA dude determined to determine who has murdered me\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow can I trust girls I find in the Dusk World?\nIts dank musty musk must just blur lines\nSlur words, disrupt and usurp minds\nA corruption of the worst kind\nBut I need all the aid that I can find\nBetween mediums and demons, I will mainly have to pry\nMaybe have to find, a shady patch and hide\nFrom their crazy appetite, I\u2019m not a tasty snack, am I?\nI've already made the sacrifice of life\nAnd the fact is I would like to not have to die twice\nMy mind keeps rewinding back to that night\nThe facts of what happened don\u2019t just stack up quite right\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nI can\u2019t explain it, I\u2019m on a hunt for the truth\nTo why my assailant made me plummet from under the roof\nSalem is a place containing hundreds of clues\nAnd my presumption is that somewhere in it somebody goofed\n\n[Hook]\nWoke up in a murder scene, a ghost interred in Purgatory\nA dude determined to determine who has murdered me\nWoke up in a murder scene, interred in Purgatory\nA dude determined to determine who has murdered me\nMurder scene, Purgatory\nA dude determined to determine who has murdered me\n\n[Outro]\nWhodunit? Who-a-whodunit?\nWhodunit? Who-a-whodunit?\nWhodunit? Who-a-whodunit?\nWhodunit? Who-a-whodunit?", "year": "2014-08-29"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
