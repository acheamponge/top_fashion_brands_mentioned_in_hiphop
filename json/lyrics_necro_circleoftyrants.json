Be left in the bubble, covered [?] the fam\nState bent, like breathing rubber, so be advised\nLucifer's rising the invocation of my demon brother\n\n[Verse 4: Ill Bill]\nSplattered in blood, rather my thoughts paddles in drugs\nMorbid visions of cadavers ravaged by maggots and bugs\nBeetles crawling out of your eyes sockets\nPuss pouring out of your mouth on top of dry vomit\nBillions of body bags, blood drenched battle fields\nBig butcher knives, you fucking faggits\nGet your fucking face erased from your cabbage\nTangled and gored on top, half of you're body hanging off the door\nSpasm and splash your organs across the floor\nIts death.. the slug hit the bullet proof vest\nI took from the policeman after I blew off his head\nWe knights of Satan serving Satan's Seders\nGod is an atheist, you fucking idiots, your bitches give brain to us\nSave yourself, the altar of sacrifice\nWe criminally insane, escape form Bellevue\nSniffing up cocaine don't even try it\nIt's Ill Bill, the gourmet of violence\nDonate my brain to science, vacation in insane asylums\n\n[Verse 5: Captain Carnage]\nCome on come all to my carnival of carnage\nWhere I'll.. slice and dice and peal off your shell like an orange\nI'm too precise not to be nice\nI know you like Christ you'll pay twice the price\nI'll put brains on ice\nFor preparation prepare for the separation\nOf your foundation so come get your found basted\nIn hot sauce I roasted like hot dogs on an open fire I'm a trig like Myer\nBut don't anile the entire picture, because I hang you like fixture so when you enter the mixture\nUse extreme caution, because it only takes one portion\nTo perform an abortion with the steel that I force in\nYou feel lost when you get tossed in the bottomless gorge\nThe heroin horde got guns and swords swords swords swords"}], "artist": "Necro"}
