(To act this way)\nForces you to scream my name\nThen pretend that you can't stay (Yeah)\nTell me, who I have to be (I know what we gotta do)\nTo get some reciprocity\nSee, no one loves you more than me\nAnd no one ever will\n\n[Chorus]\nNo matter how I think we grow\nYou always seem to let me know\nIt ain't working, (It ain't working, no) It ain't working\nAnd when I try to walk away\nYou'd hurt yourself to make me stay\nThis is crazy, this is crazy (Oh, this is crazy, uh-huh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI keep letting you back in (You back in)\nHow can I explain myself? (I don't understand why)\nAs painful as this thing has been\nI just can't be with no one else\nSee I know what we've got to do (Yeah)\nYou let go (You let go), and I'll let go too (And I'll let go)\nCause no one's hurt me more than you (No one's hurt me more than you)\nAnd no one ever will\n\n[Chorus]\nNo matter how I think we grow\nYou always seem to let me know\nIt ain't working (It ain't working), it ain't working (It ain't working)\nAnd when I try to walk away\nYou'd hurt yourself to make me stay\nThis is crazy, (This is crazy) Oh, this is crazy (This is crazy)\n\n[Breakdown]\n(Care) Care for me, care for me\nI know you care for me\n(There) There for me, there for me\nSaid you'd be there for me\n(Cry) Cry for me, cry for me\nYou said you'd die for me\n(Give) Give to me, give to me\nWhy won't you live for me?\n(Care) Care for me, care for me\nYou said you'd care for me\n(There) There for me, there for me\nSaid you'd be there for me\n(Cry) Cry for me, cry for me\nYou said you'd die for me\n(Give) Give to me, give to me\nWhy won't you live for me?\n(Care) Care for me, care for me\nYou said you'd care for me\n(There) There for me, there for me\nSaid you'd be there for me\n(Cry) Cry for me, cry for me\nYou said you'd die for me\n(Give) Give to me, give to me\nWhy won't you live for me?\n(Care) Care for me, care for me\nYou said you'd care for me\n(There) There for me, there for me\nSaid you'd be there for me\n(Cry) Give to me, give to me\nWhy won't you live for me?\n(Give) Cry for me, cry for me\nYou said you'd die for me\n(Care) Where?\n(There) Where?\n(Cry) Where were you\n(Give) When I needed you?\n(Care, there, cry, give)\n\n[Outro]\n(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da) Where were you\n(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da) When I needed you?\n(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da) Where were you?\n(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da) You, you, you, you, you\n(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da) You, do, do, do, do, do, do, do\n(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da) Do, do, do, do, do, do\n(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da)\n(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da)\n(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da)\n(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da)\n(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da)\n(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da)"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
