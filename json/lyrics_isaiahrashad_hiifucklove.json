Sanders]\n\n[Verse 1: Michael da Vinci]\nYou can have all my shine, I give you my light\nLoving this here is wrong but it feel nice\nIce cold in my veins, ice cold in my veins, ice cold\nYou feel good, you take away from my pain\nCan't remember my name, my address, I'm on the plane\n50 thousand altitudes high up well atleast off in my brain\nYou was there for me on my lows and all of my gains, I give you this ring\nIf I could, but I know dirt won't let me do it, insecure, I need my noise\nBeen too good, we share our laughs, gotta move on, that's in the past\nThis new feeling I hope it last, kinda like forever like Keith Sweat\nGave it to Heaven, I need my pass, gones by the flame, give me all\nThat you have, don't hold back, I can't crash, try to hold on keep falling off\nRight back at it this ain't golf, can't just swing and get back on\nWe just somehow lost...\n\n[Hook]\nI think I'm lost, why don't you give me my light\nI think I'm lost, I need that light\n\n[Verse 2: Isaiah Rashad]\nSee I'm addicted to light-skinned women with nice friends\nI only want to fuck, ain't trying to be with 'em\nI know I couldn't change if I wanted\nYou staring at a leather asking, \"Why it ain't denim?\"\nAnd sometime a nigga get fucked up\nAnd sometime these bitches get fucked too\nSee I was raised round the clan for the misfits\nAnd baby momma screaming out \"Fuck you\nFuck you, Zay, you only like yourself\nAnd that bald headed bitch that you been with\nYou only call when it's at your convenience\nYou either that or trying in between it\"\nI laugh at it then I take another sip\nI bet I just look like my daddy now\nBeen up two days on the Addy now\nWith the guns out screaming \"Put the Xanny down\"\nWe all codeining, pro leaning\nBut I really am tryna get the chemistry right\nCause if I mix this pill when I add this drink\nRashad'll be the nigga that'll kill me tonight\nSo how we feeling alright, stop killing the lights\nTryna numb this pain I've been living to fight\nIf we drop a few songs, we'll be living the life\nAnd a drug dealer finna make a killing tonight, so how we feeling alright\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c7cea3b4e8e2ba385a1b2d5258952e1b.630x630x1.jpg", "album": "Welcome to the Game", "year": "2012-12-11"}]}
