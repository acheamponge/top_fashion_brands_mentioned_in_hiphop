Mmm\nI pray I leave before you're gone\n\n[Chorus]\nA bird with the word came to me\nThe sweetness of a honeycomb tree\nAnd now I look, what's taking over me\nCouldn't fake it if I wanted to\nI had to wake up, just to make it through\nI got my patience and I'm making do\nI learned my lessons from the ancient roots\nI choose to follow what the greatest do\nA bird with the word came to me\nThe sweetness of a honeycomb tree\nAnd now my luck was taking over me\nCouldn't fake it if I wanted to\nI had to wake up just to make it through\nI got my patience and I'm making do\nI learned my lessons from the ancient roots\nI choose to follow what the greatest do\n\n[Outro]\nHey, my little youth is crying\nI'm almost home, almost home\nLook, no further riots, mmm\nWorking my fingers to the bone\nSee I do the best I can, mmm\nMama was a farmer, mmm\nPapa was a goner, mmm"}]}
