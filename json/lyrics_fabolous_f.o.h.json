Fuck outta here\nThem bitches said they don't what? Fuck Outta here\nBust it(5x), Wide open\nBust it(7x), Wide open\n\nMoney make the rules, Money money make the rules\nFuck Outta here(2x)\n\n[Verse 1: Fabolous]\nYou don't make no money you don't make no rules either\nReal niggas gettin' money that's the fools beefin'\nRule number one never tell a chick you need her\nNumber two she should never bite the dick that feed her\nDon't make me introduce ya bitch to this fly shit\nHave her callin' yo shit my shit\nGive her dick, And maybe somethin' nice\nThe head off the chain, Jesus Christ\nMy company is loyal, Hoes is bad for business\nMy lil' homie bust the 40 like Cain in Menace\nNever mind a hater, Hater on my mind never\nStop flexin' nigga you was hot in 97\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2:French Montana]\nMoney make the rules, All my niggas make the movies\nOnce them bitches choose she bust it open like a uzi\nShoes 2 thou a pair,And that clearport I'm there\nYou won't get none of this money, But these hot shells I share\nAnd I live by them houses, That's right by them mountains\nI just caught that lick, took me 3 days to count it\nThem bitches they love it, Bunch of young niggas thuggin'\nI don't be askin' no questions, I just tell her go bust it\nLike wide open, All my niggas gettin' high smokin'\nIf you hatin' eat a dick wit yo eyes open\nMontana Oscar Rob nigga\nThat's like 2.5 in that garage nigga\n\n[Hook]", "title": "F.O.H"}]}
