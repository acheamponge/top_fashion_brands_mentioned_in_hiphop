Shit!\"\nAnd then these labels chasing for another signature\nThe future's looking even brighter I'm a winner bruh\nAnd I'ma bring the whole crew to the end of this\nABK 225 - Don't forget that shit\nIf the fans are feeling fucked, who they run to?\nThey come to Kers I can save their life with one tune\n\n[Hook:]\nDo this for my damn crew, do this for my fans too\nI don't know if you know, I ain't stopped from Down The Drain ooh\nSee my world change, money made my world strange\nMoney makes the world go round, but money's on the world's pay\nDo this for my damn crew, do this for my fans too\nI don't know if you know, I ain't stopped from Down The Drain ooh\nSee my world change, money made my world strange\nMoney makes the world go round, but money's on the world's pay\n\n[Verse 3:]\nCalm before the storm, wait till this album drops\nI'll have a hater skitzing out like they outta pot\nI'll have these rappers copying like \"How'd he do that shit?\"\nThey either gonna bite, hate or admit it's sick\nI hit a goal in the states with some new beats\nA long shot but they hit me back like do this\nAnd i ain't gonna drop their name till this shit drops\nIf you knew behind the scenes you would just agree with Scot\nI'm over stressing what the public fucking thinks of me\nAs long as I am on the rise I'm making history\nProbably take a couple years to realise what I've done\nI changed the sound of rap in Aus since i got my buzz\nAnd rappers hating I'll leave 'em on the floor again\nDon't they realise that I'm opening the door for them\nThey can lay back, man you's are washed up\nCan dreams come true? Shit look at Scott cunt\n\n[Hook:]\nDo this for my damn crew, do this for my fans too\nI don't know if you know, I ain't stopped from Down The Drain ooh\nSee my world change, money made my world strange\nMoney makes the world go round, but money's on the world's pay\nDo this for my damn crew, do this for my fans too\nI don't know if you know, I ain't stopped from Down The Drain ooh\nSee my world change, money made my world strange\nMoney makes the world go round, but money's on the world's pay"}], "artist": "Kerser"}
