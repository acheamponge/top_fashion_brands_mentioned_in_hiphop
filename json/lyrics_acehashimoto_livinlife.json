I'm 219, this isn't mines\nEven though I barely got a nickel and a dime\nI still gotta day-to-day grind\nBehind MacBooks and Windows\nCreased up three-piece suits and gym clothes\nWhite T-shirts, Converse, and Timbos\nLies, they ending me\nThey ending me of self, no pun intended\nIt's like I'm at trial, no lawyer for the defendant\nPlaying D in the key, unable to defend it\nNot knowing your test was extended to another day\nYou made mistakes, learn from them and keep moving\nCruising onto the next one and happily\nOn my way, taking my time, I'll make it gradually\nYou actually thought that I would give it up, right?\nBut I can't, I'm addicted to the fast life\nTaking shots, rolling blunts like every night\nLiving nice up in Black man's paradise\nDoing everything that I please, fuck the price\n\n[Chorus: Ev4n Holt & brandUn DeShay]\nGot a nickel and a dime (feel like)\nActually stand with the shit that we love (feel like)\nStill gotta day-to-day grind (feel like)\nDoing everything that I please (oh, oh)\nGot a nickel and a dime (feel like)\nActually stand with the shit that we love (feel like)\nStill gotta day-to-day grind (feel like)\nDoing everything that I please (oh, oh)\n\n[Outro]\nOnly let loose when your part's finished\nOnly let loose when your part's finished", "year": "2010-05-25", "album": "Volume: Three!
