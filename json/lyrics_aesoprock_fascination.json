Martyr\nWho you think put that unseen iceberg in the water?\nManufacture flotsam and jetsam from out your charter\nWe got the once pushovers pushing back a little harder now, blink\nI think I can, I think I can\nI got grips, muckraker major spin circles 'round sunken ships\nWalk an invisible city of lost clans and he's jealous\nCause my silhouette had more dimensions than his game plans\n\n[Hook: Aesop Rock]\nFascination, fascination\nFascination, fascination\nAnd everything I do I'm fascinated with\nThat's why I pass the hated wasteland with a grin, cause in the end I got my passions\nWhile you splash in a puddle of trying to pick apart the puzzle\nFascination, fascination\nFascination, fascination\nAnd everything I do I'm fascinated with\nThat's why I pass the jaded grips of competitors who initiate disturbance with a smirk\nCause I feel I got direction in my work\n\n[Aesop Rock]\nAnd everything I touch magnificent\nPicking apart a drunken township\nSitting in the rain rusting the nails my crown's bound with\nIf I had an anchor I would lay it in the dirt and mark today\n\"The Day The Earth Stood Still\" while I complete my search\nYou honor delusions and falsified life comfort systems\nAs boy in the bubble huddled up to simple Simon subtle\nBorn tomahawk. Shock the peanut gallery loopy\nDebate the cutesy, groupie, Kewpie doll community\nAnd I'm hung in a virtual skin and bones emaciated ringworm\nCircus freak bloodthirsty intern trainee urchin feast\nWith a delectable style compiled of that which stands\nTo buff a child's yellow brick vision of slick living\nI observe the stories from my fire escape observatory\nFirst I herd the glory, then desert the herbs that word it poorly, understood?\nWell, maybe a pat on the back for the lucky losers\nWho truly felt they were born to touch the music\nI catalog cats as welcome mats, and for the ones\nInsisting on dimming the stars I wipe my sneakers extra hard\nI wish upon a penny toss that every servant will betray his gatekeeper\nAnd leap to reap the freedom fighter mad galaxy\nHuff the war gas vapors and cram hard for tomorrow\nBrother, I own twice my weight in patience\nBe it padded cubicle or beautiful tomb\nI'll be listening 'til you whistling that more suitable tune\n\n[Hook: Aesop Rock]\nFascination, fascination\nFascination, fascination\nAnd everything I do I'm fascinated with\nThat's why I pass the hated wasteland with a grin, cause in the end I got my passions\nWhile you splash in a puddle of trying to pick apart the puzzle\nFascination, fascination\nFascination, fascination\nAnd everything I do I'm fascinated with\nThat's why I pass the jaded grips of competitors who initiate disturbance with a smirk\nCause I feel I got direction in my work", "title": "Fascination", "album": "Float", "image": "https://i.genius.com/097177ea52f6ad0147914b68157107a588f47fb2?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mushrecords.com%2Falbum_art_front%2FMH202_D.jpg", "year": "2000-09-05"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
