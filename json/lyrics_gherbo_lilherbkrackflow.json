Shit that's all right\nWanna fight Herb? Shit that's all right\nHave ya homie dodgin' bullets all night, all night\n\nHundred fiends at back door\nBut they don't want blow they say they lookin' for that krack flow\nWell here it go here it go come get it while it's hot\nWe said I got that crack but you can't get it out the pot\nThis that K-R-A-C-K flow, got fans in San Diego\nYa bitch know I got peso, so she do as I say so\nAnd that's whatever, my bars hotta than a 8 block\nThis shit gon' have you dope sick you get more crack when my tape drop"}]}
