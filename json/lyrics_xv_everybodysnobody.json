I got a few of \u2018em on DVR\nI think the world just got crazy more\nI\u2019m trying to figure out what Paris Hilton\u2019s famous for\nI know that MTV felt bad for what they did to Britney Spears\nSo they had the VMA's and gave her every award\nDJ Booth nominated that\u2019s a great look\nLost to a song with Lil' Wayne that ain't have a hook\nIt's all good, it just overthrows my message\nWe always throwing money and then came a recession\nI tell you what my name is but that don\u2019t really matter\nAll that really matters is that I\u2019m one dope ass rapper\nAnd if you enjoy my chatter, then listen to these songs\nAnd I'mma keep it short so ya'll can sing along\n\n[Hook 2x]"}], "artist": "XV"}
