Then step on a skill scale\nYou're too thin to win before I begin to blast\nYour dialogue sucks, your lyrics are light in the ass\nMe and mines remain fine and in mint condition\nThey get rougher, yours suffer from malnutrition\nStop sleepin on the job slob, I advise\nDream about kickin my ass, wake up and apologize\nI'm a contender, while you plot and plan\nGot speed and a lead like the Gingerbread Man\nBring your best buck, watch 'em get stuck up\nLook for safety, I'm rigged to blow the fuck up\n\n[Chorus] - 2X\n\n[Apache]\nFuck it who's got dice; cee-lo I got the bankhead the bank's a bullet\nLose with the Tec to your teeth, hold the trigger then pull it\nWith the gift I come swift with a straight arch\nCompetition I leave 'em stiffer than spray starch\nGot a high strung tongue, can you catch it or match it\nThose who tried died by the hatchet\nI play to win friend, your game I aim for the chin\nRap is a hobby, I kick ASS for a livin\nSo what you get radio play and your record sold\nAnd you were told your shit just might go gold\nWhen I step up and strike, be prepared to duck\nI'm one deep, I don't sleep and don't give a fuck\nI'm a hood from the hood, better yet instead\nIt might be safer for you if you covered your head\nIf you win then I'll begin to bruise ya\nFuck that, I'm goin out cause I'm a sore loser\nWhen I roll up to stick-up I got'cha\nGimme mine, pay me or pay the doctor\nDon't fuck with a man 'til you're full grown\nCause I'd hate to dislocate your ass bone\n\n[Chorus] - 2X", "year": "1993-02-09"}]}
