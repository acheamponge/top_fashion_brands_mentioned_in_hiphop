You can worship the man, Kers one\n\n[Hook: Jace Excell]\nDon\u2019t mistake my kindness for weakness\nWe won\u2019t settle on your level when we\u2019re driven to the edge\nDon\u2019t mistake my kindness for weakness\nWe won\u2019t peddle to the devil in the middle of the stress\n\n[Post-Hook: Jace Excell]\nWe are nice guys but we try not to finish last\nCome and test us then we warn you won\u2019t be the last\nWe are nice guys but we try not to finish last\nCome and test us then we warn you won\u2019t be the last\n\n[Hook: Jace Excell]\nDon\u2019t mistake my kindness for weakness\nWe won\u2019t settle on your level when we\u2019re driven to the edge\nDon\u2019t mistake my kindness for weakness\nWe won\u2019t peddle to the devil in the middle of the stress\n\n[Post-Hook: Jace Excell]\nWe are nice guys but we try not to finish last\nCome and test us then we warn you won\u2019t be the last\nWe are nice guys but we try not to finish last\nCome and test us then we warn you won\u2019t be the last"}], "artist": "Kerser"}
