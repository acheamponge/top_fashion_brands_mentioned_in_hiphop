(Man, fuck it)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI ain't tryna change the world, I just wanna change my own life\nAnd transition a couple wrongs right, up\nOne of them long nights, contemplated suicide\nIn the mirror you and I, it's do or die\nI love my poppa man\nThem niggas without a father, hope the chopper jam\nBig brothers and single mothers put they kids first\nBang bang, whoopty-whoop guess who was hit first, khaki\nBitch", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c7cea3b4e8e2ba385a1b2d5258952e1b.630x630x1.jpg", "album": "Welcome to the Game", "year": "2011-09-17"}]}
