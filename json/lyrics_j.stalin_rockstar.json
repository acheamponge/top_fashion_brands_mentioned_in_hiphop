Stalin]\nTouched a lot of bands, I hope I think I deserve it\nI hope I think I deserve it\nThis some fucked up shit, lord knows I ain't perfect\nLord knows I ain't perfect\nWe was gettin' money when they was wearing throwback jersey's\nWhen they was wearing throwback jersey's\nI went from ashy to classy, nigga, so fuck Jergens\nNigga, so fuck Jergens\nYou ain't ever been in the car with niggas with the murder\nI ain't ever changed, my nigga, that's on purpose\nAin't enough money in the world, I think it's worth it\nEvery time I leave shows over closed curtains\nBitch, I don't answer the phone 'cause I be workin'\nAnd they can pull up and get this curbside service\nNiggas try and post with the kid but they be nervous\nBut I'ma Get Rich or Die Tryin' like Curtis\n\n[Hook: 4rAx & J. Stalin]\nI'm still in the dope game\nMade a name off of cocaine\nPosted on the corner all night\nFresh up out the trap, bitch, I'ma still need a shower\nBut who gives a fuck when you makin' a thousand an hour\nWhen you was sellin' my momma dope\nI was sellin' yo' momma the same thing\nStill chasin' the hun, not able to get no sleep\nI sleep with one eye open\nIt's the grim reaper chasin' me\nIt's the grim reaper chasin' me\n\n[Verse 2: J. Stalin]\nNightmares, I wake up in a cold sweat\nYou a slave to a king, I put a rope no your neck\nI ain't nobody, I'm just a nigga who write the checks\nNiggas found me in the West, on the corner with crack\nPut me in the car, said they needed me in the lab\nI had just sold a half, I had zips of some more shit\nI was outside grindin', never on no ho shit\n'Cause 'round here you get your mothafuckin' dome split\nAnd if a nigga ever run outta crack\nBelieve, I ain't gon' think twice 'bout puttin' a monkey on your back\nAnd if a nigga ever run outta crack\nBelieve, I ain't gon' think twice 'bout puttin' a monkey on your back\n\n[Hook: 4rAx & J. Stalin]\nI'm still in the dope game\nMade a name off of cocaine\nPosted on the corner all night\nFresh up out the trap, bitch, I'ma still need a shower\nBut who gives a fuck when you makin' a thousand an hour\nWhen you was sellin' my momma dope\nI was sellin' yo' momma the same thing\nStill chasin' the hun, not able to get no sleep\nI sleep with one eye open\nIt's the grim reaper chasin' me\nIt's the grim reaper chasin' me\n[Bridge: J. Stalin]\nBlack and tar bags\nNiggas know I'ma rockstar\nThey don't come around 'cause we done paid off the cop cars\nWe done paid off the cop cars\nWe done paid off the cop cars\nBlack and tar bags\nNiggas know I'ma rockstar\nThey don't come around 'cause we done paid off the cop cars\nWe done paid off the cop cars\nWe done paid off the cop cars\n\n\n[Hook: 4rAx & J. Stalin]\nI'm still in the dope game\nMade a name off of cocaine\nPosted on the corner all night\nFresh up out the trap, bitch, I'ma still need a shower\nBut who gives a fuck when you makin' a thousand an hour\nWhen you was sellin' my momma dope\nI was sellin' yo' momma the same thing\nStill chasin' the hun, not able to get no sleep\nI sleep with one eye open\nIt's the grim reaper chasin' me\nIt's the grim reaper chasin' me"}], "artist": "J.
