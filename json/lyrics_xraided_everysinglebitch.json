A bitch named Tammy was the trick\nShe gave up the pussy for not one cent\nShe didn't pay me, but fuck it I kept the ho\nAnd every night at 6 A.M. I was climbing out her window\nMy nigga Neko hit 'em too\nBut I don't give a fuck cause the nigga's from the crew\nI can't lie, I hella liked the bitch\nBut like Vamp Dogg said \"Once a bitch, always a bitch\"\nSo why bother trying to change her\nI'd rather play the role and treat the bitch like a stranger\nThe only women I respect\nIs my mother and my sister\nDisrespect I'll break your neck\nIt's hella easy pulling hoes\nBecause they all on the dick because of the Daytons and The Vogues\nSo stupid bitch you gets no play\nWe from the gardens and you got a price to pay yeah\n\nLike I said, pay me or pay me no mother fucking mind\nIf you see me walking through the mall\nSagging my Levi's with a motha fucking cellular phone outside\nYou know the gold D's and the vogues and shit\nDon't even say shit bitch cause you know what I want\nIf you ain't gonna drop the draws don't even stop and pause\n\n[Verse 3]\nJust by the greedy bitch all you have to do is flash\nA little bit of cash and the question that she asks is\nHow much money do you make, but if you really listen\nIt's how much money can I take\nFake niggas don't know the game though\nThey in love with a pretty ass burning ho\nBut fucking with me she'll get a pat on her back\nA tore up pussy and a tic-tac\nBased on the fact she swallowed all the sperm\nThe bitch thinks shes getting a free perm\nAnd a dress and a sweater, get real\nFucking with me and you'll be grinning with a happy meal\nAnd Oprah Winfrey you'll get your ass whooped\nYou better keep fucking with a Cookbook\nYou're intelligent and a black lady but don't let yo-yo get ya tore up\nAnd if you think I'm treating you wrong\nPack your shit and get your monkey ass on\nGo stay with your mama and say\nThem niggas from the gardens don't play!\n\nYa ya ya you gotta do the right thing\nYou gotta do the right thing\nAnd the right thing is to pay me\nYou could lick me from head to toe\nYou know what I'm saying a quick blow\nCause I'm from the 4\nAnd you got to give me all your mail\nYou know what I'm saying\nI need a double up you gonna pay for it?\n\n[Verse 4]\nThe bitch that's giving up the cash\nI know some hoes who will straight up jack your ass\nYou might go to the mo-mo and get you some\nBut you waking up broke and feeling dumb\nShe made you cum then your ass went to sleep\nShe got your keys and out the door the ho creep\nYou got ganked by a sneaky ass bitch\nWho's riding with another nigga fronting your shit\nBut you had to have the cock that's what you said\nAnd you thought the ho was sprung cuz she gave you head\nBut it was all part of the bitches plot\nA big spider web, yo ass got caught\nYou bought dinner that night, loc\nYeah, red lobster, a big fucking joke\nShe got fed, ate, and paid quick\nAnd all you got was the short end of the stick\nSee, niggas just love to buy shit\nThe hoes cry to make a nigga go for it\nNot me, cause see I do it my way\nAnd every bitch got a price to pay, yeah"}], "artist": "X-Raided"}
