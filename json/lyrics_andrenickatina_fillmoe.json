I floated on the scene like a butterfly, but did it like a bumble bee, so honey had to wonder why, now, you the whole truth-nothing but the truth- the rap gods baby sent me to find you put the game down, frame down, hey now picture what the broke bitch gonna say now cause they all know from the get go I say a verse from the book called Fillmoe\n\nI got the type of style that make you catch a case, It written all over my face\nGlock Tawk\nI park close to the side walk, and I'm fresh like the wings on a Colorado red Hawk\nI got the type of style that make you catch a case, It written all over my face\nGlock Tawk\nI park close to the side walk, and I'm fresh like the wings on a Colorado red Hawk\n\nI'm kamikaze baby, I don't have no trust, lost in the world of the lust, looking for the bucks, sometimes you attract them ducks but everything is done on the hush. Yightime is the right time and sometimes you get nervous at flight time but wonder what she get when it goes perfect the same night and you still want to work it, your dedication is emancipation, and you deserve a celebration like rick james I add sugar when the grits came which means were gonna be aright if the drought came, you get down with no shame and you can see I live my life in the Moe's name. You get down with no shame and you can see I live my life in the Moe's name\n\nI got the type of style that make you catch a case, It written all over my face\nGlock Tawk\nI park close to the side walk, and I'm fresh like the wings on a Colorado red Hawk\nI got the type of style that make you catch a case, It written all over my face\nGlock Tawk\nI park close to the side walk, and I'm fresh like the wings on a Colorado red Hawk\n\nIt was a hard night, tricks just didn't bite, it's 4 and there's nothing in sight. A fly through like a kite music real loud I'm tired by the way you sit down, then somebody fell through, someone you knew, you knew you could get at least two you got hyped up for the rendevous just like a kite once again I flew, meet me back at the jones, that means home, then she heard the peel out from the vouges. and she knows that I like new clothes, she says freeze and I might say froze, Mercedes Benz over Cadillac though, sometimes we hit up them R and B shows then it's back to the grind one more time one more time means one more time do we ever stop it will tell in time but right about now you can't tell this time how much baby is your bail this time hope you don't have to go to jail this time on the rap gods you'll be missed this time but when you get out you'll be rich this time\n\nI got the type of style that make you catch a case, It written all over my face\nGlock Tawk\nI park close to the side walk, and I'm fresh like the wings on a Colorado red Hawk\nI got the type of style that make you catch a case, It written all over my face\nGlock Tawk\nI park close to the side walk, and I'm fresh like the wings on a Colorado red Hawk"}]}
