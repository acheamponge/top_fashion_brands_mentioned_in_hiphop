Kelly, I wish I wish\nAnd no I ain't gon cry but I miss my bitch\nI miss my baby girl but I don't know her anymore\nYou gon do me like this, I guess this a cold world\nThis a dog eat dog world and the dogs chase the cats\nFuck thought this shit coming back, no\n\n[Hook]\nBaby why you leave me\nBaby why you leave me alone\nBaby why we don't talk no more\nI used to be your neezy\nYo' nigga fa'sho\nI used to be but I'm not no more\nBaby why you do me wrong\nBaby why you leave me x3\nBaby why you do me wrong\n\n[Verse 2]\nBaby why you leave me, you did it so easy\nI tried to tell my mama, but my mama didn't believe me\nThis shit is off the heezy, a nigga misses breezy\nI missed the freaky things she used to do just to please me\nPiddy Pablo, I had her frequently\nShe up and on faster than a GT\nJust wish I could make things rewind\nCause I'd rewind when she left me like the spring time\nI be fine, everybody knows that's a lie\nRockabye baby, rockabye baby\nI think I need to go to rehab, I'm going crazy\nI did everything you wanted me to when you played me\nAnd you know what's some fucked up shit\nI ain't even with another chick, damn\n\n[Hook]\nBaby why you leave me\nBaby why you leave me alone\nBaby why we don't talk no more\nI used to be your neezy\nYo' nigga fa'sho\nI used to be but I'm not no more\nBaby why you do me wrong\nBaby why you leave me x3\nBaby why you do me wrong\n\n[Verse 3]\nSince the day you left, I can't rest\nI been at the house by myself depressed\nRiding around the streets by myself\nTryna find somebody cause I really need help\nSo baby come back, baby come back, baby come back, baby come back\nTell me what's the issue, girl I really miss you\nI just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna kiss you\n\n[Hook]\nBaby why you leave me\nBaby why you leave me alone\nBaby why we don't talk no more\nI used to be your neezy\nYo' nigga fa'sho\nI used to be but I'm not no more\nBaby why you do me wrong\nBaby why you leave me x3\nBaby why you do me wrong", "title": "Leave Me Alone"}]}
