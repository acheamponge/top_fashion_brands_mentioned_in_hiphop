roads got messy for real\nYou don't know 'bout pain in the courts for a M and your marj don't how to feel\nRainy nights on the block, that's a late night drill\nRest up my bro, but more time the pagans feel\nThis shits intense, the [?] been peak for real\nListen, it's either you got it to bruck it\nAnd I hate when it jams like fuck it, plot it, don't chuck it\nTalk shit, I can draw out yutes, we can do this public\nThe difference with us and them, we don't talk 'bout pumping\nIt's like Halloween, get a kweff in your head like pumpkin\nI was cramped with Miles and Shegz on a late night hunting\nSo push my bro the limit, of course I'll jump in\nI've got a shot with your name so mind how you talk and stuntin'\nWe slap loads of sweets for you team, stop frontin'\nRainy nights, the Nine will step on the crud ting\nMost of the time we roll on them yutes, they're cutting\nAnd late nights get tekky, the corn in the spins too loud, make it bang like Fekky\nRest up Sheggy, he got B2, no leggies\nOnly half of the story's told by my darg, too cheffy\nMind out if you're talking crud cah the teeth look hefty\nThe flows insane, they're rating the bars, I'm hard, my bros too heavy\nHow many times we stepped wap and popped it at headies\nListen, look, days I was broke I was juggin' around with my phone\nAnd days I was telling my shots it was flavour they're talking 'bout lems the dome\nPeddle bike grinding, making a name on my own\nNow I'm out here shelling the shows and smuggling O's\nBrodie this is the life I chose, now there's [?] on my life, too road\nThe feds done a sweep, now half of my team on hold\nDamn, the whole of the hood been trapped in a Trident zone\nDamn, the whole of the hood been trapped in a Trident zone\nThe realist know\n\n\nPart

play squares in the cage\nAnd that was a ting for our age, that truly taught me a life lesson\nDon't be a dog, be the king in the game\nSpitting real facts get that stuck in your brain\nAnd I remember, until November\nMandem writing bars and rhyming\nMiddle of the circle, spitting hard digits Sony Ericsson, playing out Nutty Violinz\nThose were the days I got used to, mmm hmm\nAnd you know them ones when your boys got twos and you gotta use Bluetooth\n(Rah that one's a throwback)\nAnd I remember, firework season with the broski's never took no caution\nAnd after the longest day in the ends, we'd all grab a munch, a big portion\nAnd you know my meal five piece with the chips\nAnd the barbecue wings, lick our tings in the park\nHave a laugh with the tings, rah that one's a throwback\nLet me tell you 'bout throwback\n\n[Chorus]\nLet me tell you 'bout my throwback\nBack in the days with my bros, let me tell you 'bout my throwback\nAll the good memories that I own, let me

love for my bros cah I miss 'em a lot (Still got love for my bros)\nAnd, hold tight the mandem locked in a steel cage box\nBrozay wants to pop and bop, then\nBack to the grind bro, watch how the T-line pop\nWe were kids in the 9 but my circle supplied 'dem crops\nLook, the trapping looked peak\nI bag and repeat, I slang it and pattern the streets\nWrap that two in the blue of the bujj and crack to supply 'dem feens\nBaby rock with the tug and I can provide your dream\nLet me come to your crib for some lunch, we can blow some trees\nMy R.O.D, she my sweetest one and my realest G\nShe be throwing it back and be brucking it out to the beat\nLet me chat in your ear, she's in love 'cah my voice too deep\nShe's in love 'cah my voice too deep\n\n[Chorus]\nLet me tell you 'bout my
