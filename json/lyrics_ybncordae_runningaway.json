Aye!\nWalk in Barney's just to fuck up a check\nDead broke now you stuck up in debt\nTake a flick, double cuff just to flex\nUpgrade my life from the shuttle to jets\nGo from noodles to steak, I got food on my plate\nPave my own way you just do what they say\nY'all follow wave stay true my way\nAin't no waiting tomorrow I do it today\n\n[Hook]\n\nWhen you coming up you evolving\nMember days we was balling\nStarry night, the sky's falling\nBut everybody has a calling\nI'm still searching for mine too\nPlain sight from the sky view\nSoul searching they'll find you\nBut got nowhere to hide too\n\nAnd so I'm running away, I'm running away\nAlways running away, I'm running away\nGotta stop running away, I'm running away\nCan't keep running away, running away", "title": "Running Away"}]}
