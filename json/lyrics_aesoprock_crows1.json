{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Kimya Dawson]\nBirds of a black\nBlack feather stick together forever and ever and they always remember you\nAnd all of the shit you do\nThey pass it to the baby birdies and then they remember too\nLittle baby blue eye's eyes turn black\nWithout forgetting the face of the guy in the mask\nWhen you see me baby will you scream or will you laugh?\nLittle baby blue eye's eyes turn black\n\n[Aesop Rock]\n4 and 20 gory pantone black crows shredding innards\nThe silouettes are fencing lefty scissors\nSeparating horn and hoof as evil's own arpeggiators\nThey piggy back the tombs of all your deadest friends and neighbors\nBuy the getty image, green-cheese moon\nDead-of-winter shit, graveyard tchk! tchk!\nShifter shit, brother was a face card\nCrown like a heart-shaped tunnel of woven branches leaning in over his hydro-plaining pace car chase...\nWait up let me isolate the bass more\nGate of god's acre\nAim to rake the snow off each forsaken name here\nSupposedly closure'l free the vipers out the bosom\nPersonally I think it's a bunch of bullshit\nPrisoners, tradition is for lovers\nGod forbid he flip the witch against her coven on some \u2018dip or play the dozens\u2018\nNow I baptize skips in larvae and dental records\nOn a little plot pregnant with 6 million sentence-enders\nAnd the tech support for tragedy's emphatically horrendous\nTeenage operators explaining what bated breath is\nPass, I wish it were something I could diagram on a napkin so you won't feel so detached if it should happen to you privately\nPublicly your shadows'll cat call back\nHappy to split the button eye and burlap doll\nCrack the crypt\nBats eject like cousin death's wing-ed lapdogs ricocheting sonar of the sacrilege\nNow let me slow this whole shit down for all you half-goat cowards\nI'll even grit my teeth for you\nI am so completely off the god-damn grid it's not a question of addressing me\nIt's \"what do these symbols under the dresser mean\"\nPerhaps a little dash of karma chameleons through the entropy for good/young\nCould've used a good lung\nStill, proximity to corpses wasn't nothing to the kid but unforgiving science or cinematic horrors\nFast forward, my knee in the gut of a glass coffin\n\"remember that cow in the dean's office seems awkward\nAnd I know your people donated pints to the same pavement but for ash and bone to share a space with strangers seems outrageous, ain't it?\nMaybe a dialog of howls that reshapes thejowls and face somehow relates to whatever you have found among a thousand cloned shrines\nEither way - dope stone lion\n\n[Kimya Dawson]\nAnd they call to let you know your friend is dead in a box\nThe crows have the tools to get the meat out of the box\nScientific, ritualistic, headstone cold foxes still rot\nI'm not gonna rot, no, fuck that snot\nYou can let them let you rot, man\nBut I'm not going to watch\nI'm not gonna stand atop your plot\nI love you friends, but I'm just not\nOn the other hand if your ashes are scattered in the sea\nI will swim in the sea and you'll be with me\nAnd if your shit is scattered at the roots of a tree\nI will climb that tree\n\n[Aesop Rock]\nEverything you think you're hiding shows\nIn the way you view the graves like a string of tiny thrones\nMessages you'd tucked away for keeps has resurfaced to be heard amidst the butchery and beaks\nYou don't want the passengers to pass\nYou want each cow taxidermy'd fatter than the last\nMausoleum lighting is a rush\nWhile it might enhance a silhouette it might expose a crutch\nA proud chest puffed to the heavens\nHolds nothing if we're cutting past the muscle and the tendon\nAnd we will be cutting past the muscle and the tendon...", "title": "Crows 1", "album": "Skelethon", "image": "https://images.genius.com/be7ecb35b49d25728281da97d28c2ca1.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2012-07-10"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
