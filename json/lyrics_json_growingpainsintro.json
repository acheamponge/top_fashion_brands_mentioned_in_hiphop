These are our growing pains\nLet's go\n\nLook at my soul, then look at my heart\nThen look at my scars and look at my face\nLook at the cross and look at His palms\nLook at them thorns, you're looking at grace yeah\nSo when he's allowing pain it's afflicting me\nI'm just simmering I'm more tender meat, rotisserie\nHe'll take me out when he's ready though it seems awful long\nAt the end I'm better seasoned, flesh falling off the bones\nBut I know what it's like when I'm crushed\nBecause of my bad decisions bars\nMinus the track listing, package ripped, no merry Christmas\nHe's whispering\nI'm hearing my enemy telling me foe\nBut I've been picked up cause of his mercy\nSo it's my Lord that's telling me no\nTelling me watch, telling me run\nTelling me fight, telling me go\nTell me keep guard, look at The Son\nAfter the pain then I will grow\nSo, just know that I'm reading when water's banging up on my levy\nThe Rock, He got me, He'll spot me\nWhenever the load is heavy\nAnd it's for certain just know it\nThat living for is worship or promise this hurting\nSuffering truly has a purpose\nWe'll grow\n\nI will go through the pain\nI will fight through the dark\nWalk with me as it rains\nAs you break me apart\nBut I need you to help me\nI need you to help me\nI need you to help me\nI need you to help me\nI will grow through the pain\nThrough the pain I will grow\nI will grow through the pain\nThrough the pain I will grow\nI will grow through the pain\nThrough the pain I will grow\nI will grow through the pain\nThrough the pain I will grow"}], "artist": "Json"}
