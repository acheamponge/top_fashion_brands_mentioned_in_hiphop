So special\nYou multi-facetted, you can cut glass wit it\nSo brilliant, go spend a little dough\nLook like you sold millions\nPlus you everlastin'\nAnd drastically important\nWhen sportin' your ghetto fashion\nYou ain't guess then you ain't listenin'\nIf you stay glistenin' then just shake your wrist and\nJust shine with your girl's best friend (diamonds)\nRock and blind 'em with your girl's best friend\nWildin' with your girl's best friend (diamonds)\nIt's D.I. and your girl's best friend\nWhen I raise 'em in the sky\nShine so bright, it'll blind your eye\nDiamonds are a girl's best friend\nRollin' wit you until the end\nWhen I raise 'em in the sky\nShine so bright, it'll blind your eye\nDiamonds are a girl's best friend\nRollin' wit you until the end\nWhen I .. in the sky\nShine so bright, it'll blind your eye\nDiamonds are a girl's best friend\nRollin' wit you until the end"}], "artist": "J\u00a0Dilla"}
