You brighter than the sun we knew since you was one baby\n\nNasty C: In the North with the gods baby\n\nOmari: That you'd be the one to fight and overcome baby\n\nNasty C: I pray to Jesus\n\nOmari: So do we believers\n\nNasty C: Buy you a crib overseas\n\nOmari: Nah, nah I don't need that. Just make sure to come by and see us\n\n[Poem: Omari Hardwick]\nOur son is a star baby\nLook how far he done gone\nAnd look how far he done flown baby\nLike a spaceship to Mars baby\nI wrote a poem baby\nI was so wrong baby\nNow you done blown baby\nSo damn strong, our son baby\nI pray to God baby\nKeep him from harm baby\nOur son is a star baby\nHis verses like warm gravy\nSaving the young and lazy\nGeneration of 20 and crazy\nI pray the Lord baby\nKeep him safe from the thieves baby\nSteal his beliefs baby, even his peace baby\nYour son is a star baby\nI scream from the car baby\nEverything you are baby\nEven got your charm baby (Your son is a star baby\nIn the North with the gods baby)\nLook how far he done gone baby (I pray to Jesus)\nThere's so much to go baby\n(To buy you a crib overseas)\nNext stop: Gold baby\nOur little rock done rolled baby\nHe got your soul baby\nHe ain't even 20 years old baby\nLook at our son baby\nHe pray to Jesus baby\nHe gave me some keys\nBuy a house overseas baby\nOur Mighty Mouse brave baby\nBut I don't need it baby\nJust make sure to come see me baby\nAnd maybe free us baby, maybe free us baby\nI see Mandela, Winnie baby\nOur son is winning baby\nI see you grinning lady\nYour son down here, your son down here\nDone become a star baby\nHe a star, star, star baby"}], "artist": "Nasty C"}
