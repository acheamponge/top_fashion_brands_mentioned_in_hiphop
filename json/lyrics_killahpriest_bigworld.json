Ya'll take and put it in a cage\nThen take it to the zoo, so ya'll can view all of my rage\nToss popcorn at me, No, I'm not happy\nThat's why I'm pacin' back and forth, cause ya'll can read my thoughts\nYa'll know when I hunt I leave a corpse\nMy innocence is all that I plead in court\nI heard you dogg\n\n(Chorus) (2x)\n\nThey said it wasn't extraordinary, it was just a rhyme\nBut I prove the unordinary, stood the test of time, My\nFlesh, my mind, my spirit arose in the lyrics\nWas hidden inside of the soul to reveal it\nEvery emotion is an emotion of my pen\nWords of the gem it shines in the minds of men\nFor those that don't receive light, it blinded them\nSo when they do, push rewind again\nOver and over till they feel me getting closer\nTill I'm more than just a picture on a poster\nTill finally break down on they sofa\nThen they show love, the room's gettin' colder\nThen they feel the presence, I give em' the message\nMy words make the hair stand on their arm\nEmbrace my psalms, like a child embrace his moms'\nSo sing along, and feel it forever\n\n(Chorus 4x)"}]}
