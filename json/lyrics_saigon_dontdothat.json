starter who can hit the bar harder\nI order bacardi with dark lager\nTo chase that mess its burning my chest like hot lava\nVerbally im a rotweiler you gon learn to respect me\nCuz you ain't even a doberman you a german shepard\nAnd thats a back in the day dawg\nThugs now a days will cock it back pop a cap in your acorn\nFuck what they say in they songs\nGangstas dont stay long\nThey make a little noise then they gone\nThats why i tell my sister i love her\nPlus my mom and my brother\nLive for today i know im not promised another (another)\nYou little punk mother fucker\nI ain't got no love for you i got a slug for you\nIts possible today can be your very last morning\nMove your ass on and take this as a last warning\n\nDont d-d-d-dont dont do that\nDont dont d-dont dont do that\nDont d-d-d-dont dont do that\nIf you dot wanna get slapped dont do that\nYou been talkin behind my back dont do that\nSteady runnin off at the trap dont do that\nYou want me to say something back dont do that\nCuz that shitll get you slapped shitll get you slapped\nYou been talkin behind my back dont do that\nSteady runnin off at the trap dont do that\nYou want me to say something back dont do that\nCuz that shitll get you slapped shitll get you slapped\n\nFrom a petty larcenist to armed robber its the yardfather\nI ain't jamaican but label me as the don darta\nLet a nigga try to bomb bodda\nI got a razor sharper than kareem abdul jabars barber\nYou you a disgrace to your pops in the pen\nAll he hearing about his son is the cops are his friends\nOnly time he heard your name in a sentence with gun\nWhen you told and got a nigga sentence for one\nHe ain't raise you to be no bitch be no snitch\nSpent to much time with your moms sweet old bitch\nWe was chewing you was suckin your chico stick\nShoulda sent your fairy ass to military class\nNow your moms gettin sceamed on by your dad\nLike we shoulda had a daughter instead of a fag\nThis the last time im tellin ya i swear its for sure\nI shouldn't even ever have to say this no more\n\nDont d-d-d-dont dont do that\nDont dont d-dont dont do that\nDont d-d-d-dont dont do that\nIf you dot wanna get slapped dont do that\nYou been talkin behind my back dont do that\nSteady runnin off at the trap dont do that\nYou want me to say something back dont do that\nCuz that shitll get you slapped shitll get you slapped\nYou been talkin behind my back dont do that\nSteady runnin off at the trap dont do that\nYou want me to say something back dont do that\nCuz that shitll get you slapped shitll get you slapped\n\nIf you go to w w f u\nSomebody put a slug in your brother then guess who\nYou know ima thug it but love it the best do\nNot to many love it as rugid as S do\nIm so special\nIm what the fuck is lyricism\nAnd im open to all your constructive criticism\nLet a nigga step outa line\nI get the tech and the 9\nFrom up have a son truck and hit him with it\nI told him not to do it\n\nThe nigga went and did it\nHe talkin shit about me dawg now he feelin a get it\nAnd im ready to let the pop gun squirt\nAnd sit hoppin g rockin free saigon shirt\nCuz he be tryna play me is not gonna work\nGod made dirt now put some on top of this jerk\n\nDont d-d-d-dont dont do that\nDont dont d-dont dont do that\nDont d-d-d-dont dont do that\nIf you dot wanna get slapped dont do that\nYou been talkin behind my back dont do that\nSteady runnin off at the trap dont do that\nYou want me to say something back dont do that\nCuz that shitll get you slapped shitll get you slapped\nYou been talkin behind my back dont do that\nSteady runnin off at the trap dont do that\nYou want me to say something back dont do that\nCuz that shitll get you slapped shitll get you slapped\n\n(I Know)\nI know i know i know i know life got much more to offer me\nAnd i know i know i know i know the system treats us unlawfully\nAnd i know i know i know i know that a new day is yet to come\nAnd i know that ill be rite here with the nation\n\nWe live in a place where babies are born addicted to base\nIf you get arrested you likely to get kicked in your face\nA lot of bitches is sick with the \"H.\"\nIf you dont want the \"I.V.\" think before you put your dick in her waist\nIts a disgrace theres only one particular race\nThat got fucked ever since we got shipped to the states\nLike being trapped in a pit full of snakes\nThey callin the coke dandruff the ghetto been inflicted with flakes\nI listen to rap but wouldn't let my kid listen to that\nCuz if my kid listen to that then its a wrap\nNiggas replace wisdom with materialism\nI use the rhythm to preach about imperialism\nI get on it like martin luther king and do the damn thing\nFar as snitching goin like j-lo i can sing\nBut ill eat you like a planet wing\nLets pop a cop and then pop some champagne\n\nI know i know i know i know life got much more to offer me\nAnd i know i know i know i know the system treats us unlawfully\nAnd i know i know i know i know that a new day is yet to come\nAnd i know that ill be rite here with the nation\n\nThey got drugs of all sorts coming through the airports\nOnly once every five years somebody get caught\nHow many lives must heroin cut short\nHow many us folk gotta grow up to smoke shoot sniff or snort\nWe no longer serving them dimes to manuever through turbulent times\nMe and my niggas murdering rhymes\nMy life breathe like a verse in a song\nSo its in the quran word bond yah gonna worship the don\nConvict since a young age face plastered on the front page\nPicture me workin for minimum wage\nI went in a rage packed the mack 10 and the gage\nIn the streets i seen more action that nicholas cage\nBuck one for my niggas locked for using a gun\nBuck two and them niggas that bucked Roo fuck you\nBuck three for lucky\nBuck four for all my dawgs up north lets get this jump off jumped off\n\nI know i know i know i know life got much more to offer me\nAnd i know i know i know i know the system treats us unlawfully\nAnd i know i know i know i know that a new day is yet to come\nAnd i know that ill be rite here with the nation", "album": null}], "artist": "Saigon"}
