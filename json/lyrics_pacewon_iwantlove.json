My life's an open book\nTo get here, to this point\nYou can't imagine what it took\nThe courage and the struggle\nAnd the fear of being shook\n?\nIt seem like I was running\nFrom the obstacles they put\nIn front of me\nBut I was moving forward like a rook\nAnd never looking back\n?\nJust beacause the past is like a vault\nYou can't escape it\nAnd it hurts because it was your fault\nThe choices that you made\n?\nYou chose to run\nBut you've got to crawl before you walk\nYou see it takes mistakes to put ? to a ?\nYou learn from 'em so you won't make 'em anymore\nMistakes are like a ?\nThey can ? on every door\nYou need them for the ?\nTo be connected to the ?\nWe need mistakes to achieve the visions that we saw\nThe goals we set come to life and keep us moving forward\nThere is many path, many roads and many have before\nSometimes we take the wrong one and we wind up in a morgue\nSometimes we take the right one and we wind up where we tought\nSuccessful and the ?\n\nI want love, but it's impossible\nA man like me, so irresponsible\nI want love, but it's impossible\nA man like me, so irresponsible\n\nYeah. Now I've been at the top and I've been at the bottom\nI was doing well but still my attitude was rotting\nRecently developed ways of life have me ?\nNow thinkin about the days of my people picking ?\nAnd forced to be ?\nI guess I was a shame and shame had me hiding that\nFact that people hissed and might not view me as an equal\nKinda ? can really be so evil\nThe people might get even by picking up a pistol\n? clearer than the crysta\nExpressing what they feeling by balling up a fist\nAnd being violent just to make sure you get the gist\nBeing violent so the people know just what it is\nViolent for the sake and make ? you don't miss\nSee if I start the war we have to talk the former treaty\nBut if I acted peacefully, people won't believe me\n? simple overlooking ?\nBut when a person screams overlooking ain't so easy\n?\n\nI want love, but it's impossible\nA man like me, so irresponsible\nI want love, but it's impossible\nA man like me, so irresponsible", "year": null}]}
