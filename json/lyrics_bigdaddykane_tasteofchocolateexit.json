Now check this\n\nI wanna talk about peace and unity and love\nNot one, but all of the above\nComin' together like keys on a piano\nBlack and white to unite and oh man oh man\nWhat joy did we, find\nHard for me to say it sometimes", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9018e5e448f4d08b6115d24de00e8af0.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": null, "title": "Taste Of Chocolate (Exit)", "album": "Taste of Chocolate"}]}
