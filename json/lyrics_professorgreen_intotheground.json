Insult me, I insist\nA dimwit with a dick covered in lipstick on the prowl\nWalking around zipper down; dick sticking out!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nWho wants to fuck with me now?\nA half-wit with a fringe started it and he's stuck with me now\nI'm hunting him down\nWow, how could he accuse me of clucking over Krusty the clown?\nYou're in trouble, prick, I'm in a muddle, prick\nIs that your chick or Mick Hucknell, prick?\nDick, minge, you puss\nI pray for the day that I find him face down in that ginger bush\nImagine cheating on your wife\nFootballers are as sleazy as you like\nImagine sleeping with the wife of another\nImagine sleeping with the wife of your brother\nImagine if I said Imogen, I may do\nIf I hate you, for me to name and shame you ain't nothing\nSo make a mistake and say something, nothing\nNot even an injunction with a cape could save you\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don't say this to all the girls, just you, because I trust you\nCome here slut, I need a drug mule\nI do these things because it's fun to\nI don't need a mule for drugs\nI just wanted to see if you were in love enough to put drugs up you\nNow you got a clunge full of munk and mushrooms\nI really can't believe you called my bluff\nI ain't fingering your chick, I'm looking for my drugs\nWhy think about what I say? I say what I feel\nWomen call me rapey, I say cop a feel\nThe worst day on this earth was the day I got a deal\nI ain't been the same since the day I dropped a pill\nI ain't lost appeal, I got appeal though\nSpit hard, kick rhymes with a steel toe\nCap, been bad with a real flow\nBack, intact and I'm still pro, rah!\n\n[Bridge]\nYour opinions aren't shit to me\nI couldn't give a fuck what you think of me\nI may contradict myself as I change and I grow\nThough my bet'd be I'll be this way till I'm old\nFrom when I was young I've been too long in the tooth\nI ain't down with the trumpets; I ain't quirky or cool\nIf I've offended you and you're coming to get me\nJust know if I'm going to hell, you're coming with me\n\n[Hook]", "year": null}]}
