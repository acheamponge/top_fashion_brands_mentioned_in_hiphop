Is, is it over?\n\n[Verse 2: Yung Lean & Bladee]\nNever will I rise to fall, I've seen that light from very far\nI pack my bag, I pack my bag, bet you could never match the stars\nKeep my boys 'round, they watch my back\nFollow the lights, we in the cab\nHash is from Uzbekistan, I ball like asics 'cross the land\nYou see my face, I see your hands\nShe don't want to understand, but I have a plan\nMixing alcohol and xans, with my, with my gang\nYou can find me where I stand, Disney wonderland\nI don't ever get attached, doesn't work like that\nDoesn't work like that\nBlack bracelet, never show faces\nTwo pills runnin' round in the matrix\nNever show faces, never show faces\nTwo pills runnin' round in the matrix\n\n[Hook: Yung Lean]\nAll I roll is potent, we stay golden\nWe gone hocus pocus, they think they know us\nI'm flyin' in a Lotus, in a Range Rover\nIs my life over? Is, is it over?\nAll I roll is potent, we stay golden\nWe gone hocus pocus, they think they know us\nI'm flyin' in a Lotus, in a Range Rover\nIs my life over? Is, is it over?\nLotus, Ranger Rover, is, is, it over?\n\n[Outro: Yung Lean]\nTake, take, take, take\nTake control of, take control of me\nTake control of Lean, take control of me\nYeah, it takes control of me", "title": "Hocus Pocus"}]}
