I'll staple your tongue to your motherfuckin' cheek 'till you can't speak or eat\nFor a whole week\nThen I'll throw your grandmother of off fuckin' Pike's Peak\nFuck a tight beat, if it's hot I still hate it\nSpit over the track and murder the dude who made it\nCome out of the booth and stab the engineer\nCut off his ear to wear as a souvenir\nOsama Bin Laden's my boy, I'll get him on the phone\nPlan another 9/11 on your grandma's retirement home\nBLAOW!\nBunch of dead senior citizens\nBobby Bloodbath\nWatch your back EOM\n\n[Outro: Bobby Bloodbath]\nMotherfucker\nBobby Bloodbath, stand the fuck up New York City\nBy the time you hear this track\nAll these other motherfuckers, Wax, Android, EOM be in the bottom of a river somewhere With concrete trapped to their fuckin' feet\nWith fuckin' photographs of their children all over their fuckin' bodies\nBobby Bloodbath motherfucker stand the fuck up!\nEast New York\nConey Island\nBitch ass motherfuckers!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/80a8f98d2de41e1d691e1395431f7e34.700x700x1.jpg", "album": "Liquid Courage", "title": "Concerto Del Muerto"}]}
