Product of a mixed marriage\nI'm violent, you better be silent like the 'J' in spanish\nImmacurate, saw moons and stars and flames in back of it\nRap past the untalented. Dangerous, haters try to silence it\nCouldn't accomplish it. I'm bringin' the ruckus, I promise it\nMy skills are polished it. 'You wack, nigga.' I'm wack's opposite\nDrama's been poision pen venom bent up inside of your brain\nMy lyrical syringes for dope fiends to take my name in vein\nPhysical frame, the heron Frankie Lyman over-dosed on\nI'm strong, I make you look weaker than Usher wit' no shirt on\nI still attack tracks like two young-G raps\nThis industry's ill, it's a bunch of hyperchondriachs\nAnd I'mma smack ya face off ya face for bitin' rhymes\nLike I've more skills than you niggas if you practiced for three lifetimes\nLyrical hangtime.

Chino's so raveshing\nYou couldn't double X-L if you was the magazine\nThe black Nazerine, takin' charism. The hell in the battle\nYou mix with sugar and shit spice, you're not add ho!\nYou're gettin' sex pay-back from my lyrical syntex\nNigga, ya index finga wouldn't trigga a bottle of Windex\nAnd I forgot more lyrics then you will ever write. Tight wild like\nEddie Murphey gettin' caught with that transvestite on that night\nYou cats might get put to sleep like pills I be nodding on\nFoldin' niggas' Averexes while they still got 'em on!\nBuildin' underground side holes with lights dimmer than the ones in\nBiggie Smalls's hallways. Colder than a menthol lip that's\nHaulin' rap in the fall. My foot deep in the ass of\nNiggas that's Glock rhymin' me. I do to your future, dog\nI'm savage.
