I never chickened out\nBut if I got to make a second pick I'd take a different route\nBut a grip of my decisions pretty Mickey Mouse\nI tried to join the 27 Club, they kicked me out\nIt was like I'm limping into heaven while my dick is out\nAnd there's Amy Winehouse sitting on a cloud and drinking stout\nBut she spits it out the moment I come gliding in\nShe's all like, \u201ccome on Joplin, who the fuck invited him?!\nHide all of the Heinekens!\" No, they don't know my name\nMy heart is lowkey broken so I'm taking Novocain\nAnd Jimmy Morrison, The Doors, and Brian Jones, you know, the Stones\nAre joking, toking on a roach playing a poker game\nI know that I'm a bastard. The walls are alabaster\nJimi plays his Stratocaster jamming out with Kurt Cobain\nThey're playing Purple Rain, or maybe Purple Haze\nAnd Kurt says, \u201cHow the fuck they let this jerk in with his hurtful ways?\u201d\nI try to jump and spread my wings like I'm a bird of prey\nBut I hit the earth and break a mothafucka\u2019s vertebrate (hey)\nI guess I'm fucking up the blueprint for success\nWoke up in the hospital with Jimi's bootprints on my chest\nThis recklessness, no common senses\nI Kamikaze, there's consequences\nI don't condone it, but I did it, I'ma own it\nI've been living for the moment gotta go (go!) 'cause\n\n[Hook: Jimetta Rose]\nAll you can do, is\nAll you can do, is\nAll you can do, is\nAll you can do, is\nAll you can do, is\nAll you can do, is\nAll you can do, is\nAll you can do, is", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/eca9a7aba35fa545bce5da0a2274f80a.1000x563x1.jpg", "album": "All You Can Do", "title": "All You Can Do"}]}
