{"artist": "Watsky", "songs": [{"year": null, "lyrics": "I\u2019m not trying to brag or anything but I\u2019m going to tell you about my night last night\nHad a couple beers, ya know\nYeah, got a little tipsy\nGot a little existential crisis-y\n\nLast night I drunk text messaged God\nI just wanted to tell him I\u2019d been thinkin\u2019 about him\nA lot\nAnd to tell him I\u2019m stalking a church\nI meant to write starting a church\nNo one spells drunk texts right, anyway\nLast night I sent out a buttload of embarrassing texts and then copied them to everyone I know\nLike \u201cYo\u201d\nLike \u201cSup\u201d\nI was out sinning\nCurled in a bed\nThe room is spinning\nIt\u2019s all in my head\nI can\u2019t get to sleep\nAnd the weight of the world\nIs the weight of my sheets\n\nHere\u2019s the great thing about my church:\nYou can keep your religion \u2018cause my church is for those of us who grew up wishing we believed in an afterlife\nAnd for those of us who were so close to god we could practically lean over and make out with her\nMy church is sick of bloody crusades to the march of drum corps\nI\u2019ll start a church that gets pissed off and starts thumb wars\nMaybe a church that gets Mondays off for religion reasons\nA church that throws phone parties in elevators to learn about praise\nThe roof, the roof, the roof is on fire\nWe\u2019ll dance as it burns for 8 magical days\nThat was a Jewish reference\nNo offense to Gideon bibles but my church goes into hotel rooms and fills up the drawers with chocolate pillow mints\nAnd my church, if you choose to come to Sunday school, you don\u2019t learn about hell\nHell no\nYou eat Jon Stewart and Steven Colbert shaped potato chips and watch Chapelle\u2019s show\nMy church had 10 commandments, 5 precepts, and a workplace abuse handbook but we partied hard last week and I think we left them in a restroom at Chuckie Cheese\nNow we just go by a picture of a heart that I found on a bar napkin\nMy church tongue-kissed your mom last night\nUm, I\u2019m just kidding\nShe left 5 red fingers across my face\nWe hung out with the creator\nI think she loves you\nShe\u2019s beautiful\nShe\u2019s got \u2018daughter\u2019 tattooed on her left bicep\n\u2018Son\u2019 on her right\nMy church is at the center of the planet and has the most amazing stained-glass windows\nThe glass is the floor of the ocean\nThe colors are where you look up and see blue and a manatee\nI love manatees\nAnd the forest canopy\nTony Montana comes to my church and forgets he left his cocaine in the car\nWe play \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d on Hendrix\u2019s broken guitar\nMy church gets fucked up on communion wine\nAsks lamp posts to be our Valentine\nMy church bar hops together\nAnd my church, if you don\u2019t blow yourself to smitherines, you get 17 virgins in a room to yourself\nOr you go and play Starfox together\nMy church got beat up by the skateboard kids for being a rollerblade kid\nBut rolled to school the next day on one skate and 2 crutches\nTrue to the fight\nWith a fist in the air\nScreaming \u201cfruit Buddhas unite!\u201d\nMy church can feel it\u2019s pulse in it\u2019s fingertips\nHas 3 stomachs because our fear is hard to swallow\nBut love always has room\nMy church has a love bladder and always asks to go to the bathroom\n\nThere are drawbacks of course:\nMy church will not resurrect your dead hamster\nMy church will not play for keeps\nWear Versace\nGive out baby Jesus Tomagachi\u2019s\nAnd Tom Cruise thinks my church sucks balls\nI\u2019m not Jesus Christ\nBut I can turn water into Kool-Aid\nAnd I\u2019m not Jim Jones\nBut my church is like, totally a cult\nAnd everyone drinks the Kool-Aid\nAnd everyone dies!\nBut for some people the Kool-Aid doesn\u2019t kick in until you\u2019re 105\nSurrounded by everyone who matters most to you\nYes, some of us go early, but at my church you have to think about that possibility\n\u2018Cause my church makes you scared\nI\u2019m talkin\u2019 like waves of fear\nLike you\u2019re lying awake at night\nAnd you pull the blankets up to your neck\nAnd your covers are like a tsunami of fear\nAnd you start hyperventilating\nThinking about how you\u2019re getting older way faster than your dreams are getting accomplished\nAbout how skinny your arms are\nAbout how fat your tummy is\nAbout how much it\u2019s gonna suck to eventually lose the power to think about all the badass stuff we do at our church\nDon\u2019t fall asleep yet\nContrary to popular belief, that\u2019s not where dreams get accomplished\nThe body of Christ is your body\nThe body of Buddha be your body\nYour body be usable\nYour body be suitable\nYour body beautiful\nYou don\u2019t need anything different\nKeep your broken cell phones\nDon\u2019t delete your text messages\nYou might read those stupid-ass,\nBadly spelled rants over on a Sunday morning...\nAnd have a religious experience.", "image":
