I'm a good person\nI'm the one who gon' ride out like a derby\nIf you my nigga imma slide out with you lurkin'\nDye your nose, paranoia I be gettin' nervous\nHad to wait the fourth quarter, I ain't have a jersey\nNiggas dying everyday can't behave they self\nBefore you jump off the porch nigga take a step\n(Nigga slow down)\nI was just a litttle boy, had to raise myself\nI was movin' too fast, had to pace myself\nPaper chasin for that cash tryna race myself\nYou know a nigga like to spaz, had to take a breath\nSometimes I think I'm too much for myself\nAnd I done cost a lot of hurt to my health\nIt'll make a nigga cry, all the pain I felt\nWhile everybody fold up, I remain myself\n\n[Hook]\nI'm the heart of the projects, hope I don't stroke\nOver here we live in poverty, everybody broke\nOver here it ain't no comedy, nah it ain't no joke\nWe just tryna make it out of it, they hanging us for rope\nNever choke, young nigga sellin' dope\nYoung nigga smokin' poe\nKickin' door, jumped right out the post\nReady to cut your throat\nReady to let em go\nProject baby, youngin' on the stroll\nSellin' coke, stressin, man we poor\nDoctor check my flow"}]}
