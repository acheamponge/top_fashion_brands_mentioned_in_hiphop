Get it off rip.\"\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Termanology]\nOff the rip I'll rip off ya head\nLet the gun tongue kiss you with lead\nTears shed, bodies missing and dead\nThen I'll piss on ya bed\nThrow a brick at your head\nThe infa-red is never impotent\nPop up with the steel make the gun get intimate\nChoppers in the church parking lot cause we ignorant\nCoppers we avoid 'em, they killing people that's innocent\nGive me an AK and a pig, we getting into it\nKla-kla-kla bang bang boom\nReady to give my life address it at your wife's address\nTo put a target on the dress\nThey say you wanna kill a man's pride, go and kill his bitch\nI'll say, \"Kill his mama and make his father go dig a ditch\"\nYou rappers ain't sick like me\nRoll up to the club strapped with a 100 spics like me\nI just drank a whole bottle of Jose to the dome straight\nAnd this Rosay, I probably won't be getting home straight\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Singapore Kane]\nOff rip I'm like the smoothest dude rolling with the rudest crew\nBring your cutie through and we'll twist her like Rubix Cube\nMake her twist my doobie too cause youse a [?]\nYou always scared like Shaggy and Scooby Doo\nI'm hostile, thoughts wild cause I ain't a lost child\nBut I got style closet tonight: stockpile\nSuper high and fly, life is the alibi\nLimit is the sky, Livin' Proof like Malachi\nSlap a body slammer guy or let the hammers fly\nYou hear that sound? Better duck like Anaheim\nSkirt wearing bozos but nah you ain't homo\nIt's just for the promo\nThey matching with they Polos\nBut y'all know my steez, wave grease and some Wallabys\nMy eyes bloodshot red because I swallow trees\nOff rip I ripped off cause of my melanin\nBut bad to the skeleton when you're soft like gelatin\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Scratching]\n\"Count the mics that I rip\""}], "artist": "Big Shug"}
