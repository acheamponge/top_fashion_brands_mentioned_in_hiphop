I'll always be there for you\nCause you're the one for me\nYou're the one for me\n\n[Hook]\nYou're the only one, only one\nThat is gonna hold us up\nI got you and after all that we've been through\nWe've been through some things\nBut it's okay, okay\nThere's no way I'm leaving\nBaby believe it\n\nYou're the only one, only one\nThat is gonna hold us up\nI got you and after all that we've been through\nWe've been through some things\nBut it's okay, okay\nThere's no way I'm leaving\nBaby believe it\n\n\n[Verse 3]\nGirl, I don't want to sound like I'm on repeat\nI know that it sounds like it might seem weak\nBeen through too much, I know it ain't easy\nTo look at my face, it's difficult when you see this\nHey we been falling apart and we've been trying to fix this\nI'm hoping and wishing that things will be different\nI don't want to lose you, I know that I miss this\nCause you're the only one on my mind I listen to\n\n[Bridge]\nTrying to be the man that you need, I need time\nAnd I know that it seems I don't try\nBut I promise I won't lie, Won't lie\nEvery time I look in your eyes, Your eyes\nGirl, I get this feeling that I never had\nAnd I just want you to understand\n\n[Hook]\nYou're the only one, only one\nThat is gonna hold us up\nI got you and after all that we've been through\nWe've been through some things\nBut it's okay, okay\nThere's no way I'm leaving\nBaby believe it\n\nYou're the only one, only one\nThat is gonna hold us up\nI got you and after all that we've been through\nWe've been through some things\nBut it's okay, okay\nThere's no way I'm leaving\nBaby believe it"}], "artist": "NF"}
