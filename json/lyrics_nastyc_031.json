Your time is limited now\nSo you was able to hide in other countries\nWhere we didn't see you, we didn't hear you\nYou can't hide anymore\nNasty C just opened the gates\nWe got a Hyena up in here\n\n[Hook]\nI'm from 031, I repre-fucking-sent\nTeeth on freeze like, \"bitch don't take another step\"\nNot my problem that you wasn't heaven sent\nBlessed, check\n(Oooh shit)\nYou know my daddy raised me well\n(Oooh shit)\nTouch my lunch, I'll ring your bell\n(Oooh shit)\nI'm doing better, can't you tell?\n(Oooh shit)\nI'm doing better can't you tell?\n\n[Verse 1]\nI just overuse my visa, yea eh eh eh eh\nI'm a real O.N.E, I represe-e-e-e-ent\nMy kicks are costly but I get em' on their ne-e-e-e-ecks\nWait a second, in the hills, that's my adre-e-e-e-ss\nBitch I came up, from the dust and the mud (woo)\nSir, I'd get up, take the bus, go to hustle (woo)\nPlease forgive us, we came from nothing it was rough\nWatchu mean \"take the crust and the crumbs\"?\nWhat the fuck?\nI want all the bread and the spread, until then, I won't rest\nGuess who just fled from itchy beds to a pent\nYes, I was stressed and depressed now I'm blessed\nAnd I don't forget to send a cheque back to my nest\n\n[Hook]\nI'm from 031, I repre-fucking-sent\nTeeth on freeze like, \"bitch don't take another step\"\nNot my problem that you wasn't heaven sent\nBlessed, check\n(Oooh shit)\nYou know my daddy raised me well\n(Oooh shit)\nTouch my lunch, I'll ring your bell\n(Oooh shit)\nI'm doing better, can't you tell?\n(Oooh shit)\nI'm doing better can't you tell?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI started off winging it\nTook it serious, now I got a minute in it\nI got me a vision and committed to defending it\nEh eh eh eh eh\nSpittin' must be in my lineage, oh shit\nMe and my dawg we predicted this, we spoke this shit to existence\nEvery day, we was consistent\nTo set it straight, we're fucking magicians\nWhen they told us \"dream of something we could live with more realistic\"\nWatchu mean? I don't follow\nAnd I didn't, I was on one\nI was buzzing, I was starving\nRap was calling, I responded\nI was certain, I had purpose\nI was nervous\nI was scared, but the city that I left\nSaid I had to represent\n\n[Hook]\nI'm from 031, I repre-fucking-sent\nTeeth on freeze like, \"bitch don't take another step\"\nNot my problem that you wasn't heaven sent\nBlessed, check\n\n[Outro: Sway]\nDid you see what he just did on this mic?\nI don't care where you from in the world\nWhen you come here, you gotta be a Hyena\nNasty C, it's official"}], "artist": "Nasty C"}
