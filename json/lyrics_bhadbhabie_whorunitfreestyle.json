Tell me, bitches, who blunted?\nYou ain't know my crew run it? All we see is blue hundreds\nOn my dash, 200, these bitches sad and can't run it\nHo I'm a star, you wanna walkthrough you better tell me who fundin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/59bb11dd71b4db005a218e6d3d2557e0.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2018-04-13", "title": "Who Run It Freestyle", "album": null}]}
