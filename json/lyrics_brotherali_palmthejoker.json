I don't know\nHave mercy on me my Lord\nI'm just tryin' to walk to the corner store\nAnd the brown and blue armies are always at war\nWhat on Earth they wanna harm me for? I don't know\n\n[Verse 1: Brother Ali]\nWe raise monsters in the basement\nFeed 'em shell casings and train 'em to chase us\nWe rip most the pages out\nOf the Bibles and Qur'ans, in this house it's their view we care about\nSuch as God has forsaken us\nAnd from his anger gush forth plagues and floods\nThe chosen people done stoned the great prophets\nHis mighty wrath stay upon us 'til the day of judgment\nWe spend days punchin brick walls\nThe scabs we rip 'em off and fill them bitches with salt\nTo all injury we add insult\nGot a leather bound edition of shit that ain't our fault\nSwabbin' down the bridges with lighter fluid\nToo timid to burn 'em, we pray the lightning do it\nI wear this mask 'til my face grow to fit it\nFrozen in a paradigm, waitin' out my sentence\nLivin' in a well (Well), self made Hell (Hell)\nMedicated, dwellin' in a pit within myself\nI waste time patiently, suffering the pain\nAnd kindly invite you to Hell for not saving me\nI see a poor victim's face\nReflected on the pawn shop glass pistol case\nThe breath make it foggy and then it gets clear\nNow which metal here would fit best in the ear?\n\n[Chorus: Brother Ali]\nHave mercy on me my Lord\nI'm just tryin' to walk to the corner store\nAnd the brown and blue armies are always at war\nWhat on Earth they wanna harm me for? I don't know\nHave mercy on me my Lord\nI'm just tryin' to walk to the corner store\nAnd the brown and blue armies are always at war\nWhat on Earth they wanna harm me for? I don't know\n\n[Outro: Brother Ali]\nWe gon' dig us a ditch, move directly to the edge and live on that shit\nFile the dice so as the seven never hits and palm the joker, reverse magic trick (No shit)\nYes shit, we gon' dig us a ditch, move directly to the edge and live on that shit\nFile the dice so the eleven never hits and palm the joker", "year": "2009-03-12", "album": "The Truth Is Here EP"}], "artist": "Brother Ali"}
