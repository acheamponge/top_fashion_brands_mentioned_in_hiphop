Pusha T)\n[Intro: Pusha T]\nLet's go\nUh, the drop-top specialist\nYes, we turn heads like an exorcist\nThese red bottoms on our feet looking devilish\nWe take it to the next level, so effortless\n\n[Verse 1:]\nI'm tired of you kicking the dirt, just want the dust to settle\nI'll find just what I deserve, if you can't do better\nCan't say that you'll take your time, before the sweet turns sour\nYou changed right before my eyes, you picked the wrong flower\n\n[Chorus:]\nDon't know what you think I'm after\nDon't think I can take anymore\nDon't know what you think I'm after\nWhat do you take me for, what do you take me for\nThen I'm like whatever\nGo on right through the front door\nBye I'll see ya later\nWhat do you take me for, what do you take me for\nOh, what do you take me for\n\n[Verse 2:]\nBoy now that the tables have turned, don't let me see you begging\nIt's a hard life lesson to learn, when it's me you're not getting\nSo low but you're all alone, and now you got no power\nLet go cause I'm cutting the rope, I guess you climbed the wrong tower\n\n[Chorus:]\nDon't know what you think I'm after\nDon't think I can take anymore\nDon't know what you think I'm after\nWhat do you take me for, what do you take me for\nThen I'm like whatever\nGo on right through the front door\nBye I'll see ya later\nWhat do you take me for, what do you take me for\n\n\n[Pusha T:]\nTwo kids in a bucket, f*ck it\nThe way you handle this\nYeah I'm disgusted\nNever been busted, treat me like a suspect\nWhy am I the one that just can't be trusted\nTry harder, discuss it, why bother\nI made you, I'll make another and she'll go further\nAnd you can bet a million on it\nSouth of France on a yacht with us chillin' on it\n\n[Chorus:]\nDon't know what you think I'm after\nDon't think I can take anymore\nDon't know what you think I'm after\nWhat do you take me for, what do you take me for\nThen I'm like whatever\nGo on right through the front door\nBye I'll see ya later\nWhat do you take me for, what do you take me for\nWhat do you take me for, what do you take me for", "year": null}]}
