Trademarc has got it locked before he meet you\nGreet your mind before we even greet you\nWon't mislead you, I ain't trustin people, cause I defeat you\nTake it down a notch, slow your roll\nCause we crush spirits, like we stole your soul\nI set styles off dog, y'all are fuckin mimics\nMan I talk more shit than pro-lifers in abortion clinics\nRun my mouth off like high school rumors\nMan and grab microphones like pedophiles gropin late bloomers\nFlow easy like your first day with white sneakers\nYou just a face in the crowd like packed bleachers\nHuh, you better rock a sleeveless\nFreddie Foxxx, Trademarc, John Cena breeze through\nY'all are fuckin divas\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: John Cena]\nFirst and foremost I sure post potential like Carmelo\nTurn a hard MC to jello\nMake their skin yellow with fear while stayin mellow and clear\nMan, we in for one hell of a year, yeah\nCurse a fool like the Red Sox, we tighter than headlocks\nI'm flowin easy with Freddie Foxxx\nKnown to hang it low like dreadlocks and y'all are too slow\nLike wearing a weight vest and lead socks\nI'm a fat kid, you feed me? I'm still hungry\nNever let a bitch take a bill from me\nLike Jordan in the 4th quarter, I'm still money\nBest believe the flow water, we still runny\nMake your stomach feel funny, I'm so sick\nWith 16 bars twice the value of gold brick\nMake it known quick that I'm greedy, we got the rats and the cheese B\nSo believe me\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "John Cena & Tha Trademarc"}
