that's where I'm on my way back to\nSo check it out\n\n[Chorus]\nUh, back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nUh, back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nUh, back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nUh, back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\n\n[Verse 1]\nFinally the TDRE is representing the PA\nSo back up and all you loud mouths shut the hell up\nIt's time to talk about the rumors we been hearing\nStab me in my back and when I see you, chump you cheering\nYou really jealous 'cause we're doing things, going places\nI should smack the phony smile off your face\nBefore I made it, it was Jack Rules Town\nYeah, so give me 30 cash for a fifty dollar food stamp\nThat's the way it was and still is\nBut people say we sold out since we hit the business uh\nUh, so I decided to produce a gangsta swing\nTo take it back to the hood of things\n\n[Chorus]\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\n\n[Verse 2]\nUh, you used to be down, uh, you used to be poor, uh\nBut now you're all that, because you do tours\nPeople call me Campbell because they think I'm suit\nUp on myself because I made a little loot\nYou got famous model Benz, a Rollie through the hood\nYeah, and the old dirty burger joint still smellin' good\nUh, to show you ain't a damn thing change\nSo come correct fool when you flex my name\nAnd if you don't punk, I gotta let you know\nGood Times is our favorite show\nYeah, so here's a little funky gangsta swing\nTo take you back to the hood of things\n\n[Chorus]\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nUh, back to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of

can we smack 'em with a third verse?\nHell yeah!\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell it's the third time the wreck shop'll get busy\nI'm with friends so way more open up so I can make my entry\nI'ma talk about the shit that been killing me\n'Cause you been bumpin' your guns like Wrigleys G\nSayin' he sounds like this, he sounds like that\nHe sounds like this, he sounds like that\nOh, what the fuck sounds like a nut in the middle of your gut\nBecause you're full of jealousy because my fans love me\nAllah gave me talent, uh, so all praises to the Lord, see\nThat's why I had to smack you with a gangsta swing\nTo take you back to the hood of things\n\n[Chorus]\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\n\n[Verse 4]\nWell it's the 4th runner-up, last but not least\nIt's the C-K-E-L to the Y, G\nYou see my brother sold crack for a Benz\nThat's when I had to step right up and put my two cents in\nHow come you don't shoot craps like you used to?\nNone of your business, get out of my face, fool\nUh, because you're makin' me nervous\nAnd I'm about to knock you in your teeth\nSome say stone styles'll try to baffle\nI'm the real record and you just a weak sample\nYeah, that's why he came up with a gangsta swing, uh\nTo take you fools back to the hood of things\n\n[Chorus]\nBack to the hood of things (back to the hood of things)\nBack to the hood of things (back to
