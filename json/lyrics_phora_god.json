I can't even love myself\nSo many broken hearts, but I couldn't tell you one I've felt\nI guess I'm just numb to the pain\nAnd everytime someone gets close to my heart, I just end up runnin' away (away, 'way, 'way)\n\n[Outro]\nI guess I'm just numb to the pain\nI guess I'm just numb to the pain\n'Cause I just end up runnin' away\nYeah, I guess I'm just numb to the pain", "year": "2017-08-18"}]}
