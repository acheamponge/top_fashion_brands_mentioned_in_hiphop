What did they lose or trade?\nNo matter where they go, no where will be totally safe\nYou left your gat and ID inside the suitcase\nThen skip town to go out put on a new face\nSo now you're\n\n[Hook]\nLost and found in the underground\nAnd if you threw it away somebody else is gonna find it\n(Lost and found) Somebody else is gonna find it\n\n[Verse 2]\nHere in the lost and found, he find a way out\nAt least he thought he did threw that suitcase out\nInto the river leave and lost for nobody to find\nAs this identity was erased from that space and time\nHe made it all the way to Tennessee\nBefore he started seeing coverage on a truck stop tv\nSeven bodies were discovered, he only killed three\nSounds like a copy cat killer replicating me\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nHere in the lost and found, they felt that he was skiddish\nAnd gave upon his work way before he was finished\nSo they found a murder weapon and pretend to be him\nWearing gloves so the gun still has his fingerprints\nNow he's back up on retirement for one last kill\nThen he's back to California to disappear within the hills\nThat was the first plan, a new place to call home\nBut the copycat killer couldn't leave well enough alone\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Blaze Ya Dead Homie"}
