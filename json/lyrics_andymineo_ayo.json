You know what it's like\nYou know what it's like?\nGetting ready for the moment\nGetting ready for the night\nBut I'm getting ready for that moment\nWhere my faith will be sight\nWhat's the point of getting fly\nIf you ain't ready for the flight? Ha!\nFrom the sight to the one I follow\nDudes find bravado at the bottom of a bottle\nUntil they got they face twisted up like a fossil\nThere's another way to live\nYou ain't got to know somebody; tell 'em!\n\n[Hook]\n(Say ayo!)\nCome and kick it with the team\nThe party's over here\nLet me show you what I mean\nWe saying (Say ayo!)\nI'm on that 1-16\nHomie come and get it right\nShow you what the clique like\n(Say ayo!)\nCome and kick it with the team\nThe party's over here\nLet me show you what I mean\nWe saying (Say ayo!)\nI'm on that 1-16\nYou can come and get it right\nLet me show you what the clique like\n\n[Verse 2]\nWheat\nCorey told me 'bout Da' Matrix\nNot that I'm about it\nI don't bang with the same set\nThat I used to claim\nSee look it I ain't famous\nSome people know my name though\nI just wan' remain low\nSo that that I don't take it to the brain, brain\nCatch me underground on the train ridin' slow\nThat's where I compose\nAll my wickedest flows\nBeing from New York\nOh, it can have its pros\nAnd its con Edison's bills high like it smokin'\nSome are uptown, it's like an expo\nLike some exposed skin, like a triple x show\nMe and my dogs flee, we don't need a vet though\nBut my flesh be itchin'\nGet it, you starting I'm trying to finish\nEnjoying God's gifts\nYou know what the dish\nUp in Barbados, they made us through flyin' fish\nWe been all around the world\nMe and the whole clique\nUnashamed everywhere\nThey holla' 1-1-6, sayin'\n\n[Hook]\n(Say ayo!)\nCome and kick it with the team\nThe party's over here\nLet me show you what I mean\nWe saying (Say ayo!)\nI'm on that 1-16\nHomie come and get it right\nShow you what the clique like\n(Say ayo!)\nCome and kick it with the team\nThe party's over here\nLet me show you what I mean\nWe saying (Say ayo!)\nI'm on that 1-16\nYou can come and get it right\nLet me show you what the clique like\n\n[Outro]\nNever bored\nNever never bored\nNever bored\nNever never bored\nNever bored\nNever never bored\nNever bored\nNever never bored\n3, 2, 1\nSomebody say ayo!
