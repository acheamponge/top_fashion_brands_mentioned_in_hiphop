Rappers braggin' bout riches sayin' they better then only makes me remember back to the shit I never had\nNo money in my pockets still I kept a smile wasn't rockin' the lastest shoes had my own style\nAnd mean while they stuck in frogelent fantisies while I was out chasin' my dreams now they mad at me\n\n(Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it movin'...)\nKeep it pushin'\n(Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it movin'...)\nI gotta keep it pushin' now these cats is steady lookin'\n[x2]\n\nHate it or love it the underdogs on top and Ima shine even after my fuckin' heart stops\nAnd I guarantee you everything I told you I was the truth and the ones who doubt me have never been around me I can teach you\nHow to read a mutha fuckas face until he's see through and make a mans confidence drop to the ground when he sees you\nThe difference between you and I, you can live without it, me I either do it or die to tell you the truth you a lie\nAnd your whole fuckin' image is so decieving I'm the future and you the only nigga who don't believe it\nI can break your words to pieces and say clean up the mess but I ain't with that, cause the best revenge is success\nSo take it how you want mutha fucka it ain't a diss all I'm tryna say is that jealousy is a bitch\nI try to keep it cool but there's only so much a nigga could take and tryna play me was your biggest mistake\n\n(Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it movin'...)\nKeep it pushin'\n(Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it movin'...)\nI gotta keep it pushin' now these cats is steady lookin'\n[x2]", "year": "2013-03-04"}]}
