Prob'ly\nBut now I'm chilled out though\nTuesday mornin' nowhere to go\nFire up the grill and call some bros\nWe four-wheel drivin' off the road\n\n[Hook]\nI like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'\nAnd Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud\nI like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'\nAnd Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud\n\n[Verse 3]\nChillin' on a monday\nDrinkin' my brew day\nFor another beer I'll gladly\nPay you on Tuesday\nCome on, let's ride around\nGet high n' ride around\nSix pack, twelve pack\nWe can all drink 'em down\nDrink 'em down, drink 'em down\nDrink 'em down, drink 'em down\nSix pack, twelve pack\nWe can all drink 'em down\nDrink 'em down, drink 'em down\nDrink 'em down, drink 'em down\nSix pack, twelve pack\nWe can all drink 'em down\n\n[Hook]\nI like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'\nAnd Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud\nI like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'\nAnd Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud\nI like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'\nAnd Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud\nI like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'\nAnd Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud\nI like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'\nAnd Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud\nI like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'\nAnd Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud\nWe are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday\nWe are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday\nWe are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday\nAnd Billy likes to peel the labels", "title": "Beer Buzz"}]}
