They are special for me\nSeriously, you are and will continue to be\n\nYou make me feel something, something nice\nThey make me feel good\n\nI'm going to disappear a few days, of everything\nMaybe you miss me, but do not forget my face\nIt will only be a few days\n\nThe world consumes me, I go out\nI feel out\n\nListen out!!! They are special for me\nSeriously, you are and will continue to be\n\nMaybe you miss me\n\nIt's you? you helped me\nIt's you? you took me out\nIt's you? you helped me\nIt's you? you took me out\n\nGOODBYE EVERYONE", "album": "My Dear"}], "artist": "SadBoyTaki"}
