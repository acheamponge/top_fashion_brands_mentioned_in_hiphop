Grip tight hold\nGot two black aces but I just might fold\nThis last name should be your last name\n(Hold on let me say that again.)\nOk midnight stroll\nGrip tight hold, I don't wanna play games\nI just might fold\nThis last name should be your last name\nI say these vows in vain\n\n\n[Hook]\n\nFreedom tastes good on my tongue\nLike a piece of twenty five cent bubblegum\nSo numb to the rush, so numb to the delicate touch\nThis is your delicate touch\nAnd she says \"listen to yourself\nI just wanna be there, sickness and in health, nothing else\"\nThere ain't no rush\nThis is my delicate touch\nThis is my delicate touch\n\n\n[Verse II]\n\nIf I had one word to describe, you and me together\nIt would be \"alive\"\nI am so alive, but I could sit here and just die\nMy life is unbuttoned, heart strings untie\nTangled in your hair\nLike a dreamy boy with a blanket\nWaitin at the stairs\nYou're different parts, that I soak 'til my lips are parched\nWith spongey words and a kiss that's tart\nThis ain't a love life, this is art\nThose little quirks that I pick apart\nWe went from making up shit like three month anniversaries\nTo sick fights\nFrom speculation to dreams\nOf givin' you mixed cd's and wedding rings\nI dont' wanna crush, I'd rather build\nKeep everything in a shoe box except those heels\nFor the midnight stroll, grip tight hold\nGet a blanket when the sun sets it gets quite cold\nThis last name should be your last name\nI'ma let you rush into my veins\n\n\n[Hook x2]\n\nFreedom tastes good on my tongue\nLike a piece of twenty five cent bubblegum\nSo numb to the rush, so numb to the delicate touch\nThis is your delicate touch\nAnd she says \"listen to yourself\nI just wanna be there, sickness and in health, nothing else\"\nThere ain't no rush\nThis is my delicate touch\nThis is my delicate touch\n\n\n[Outro]", "year": "2014-01-17", "album": "Blood In the Water", "title": "Delicate Touch"}], "artist": "Mac Lethal"}
