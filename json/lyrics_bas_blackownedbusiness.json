Let's go make history today\nLet's go make history today\nBoy use your brain, only your heart can lead\nYou'll figure your way man, this shit ain't for me to say\nI come, I love until my heart can't bleed\nI'm on the road, I guess it ain't meant for me to stay\nBut I'm here with you\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm here with you\nI'm here with you\nI'm here with you\n\n[Verse 2]\nHey world, your favorite movie is on, it's called Attack on Niggas\nThe fathers that didn't pass, they all stacked in prisons\nBut that shit don't get a pass, no that shit don't get a grant\nMight as well go fill a bag\nRidin' around, no tinted glass\nWhy I can't have tinted glass? Cause that cause suspicion\nCops flash like Cinemax, don't lack ammunition\nMight as well go get a gap, might as well go give it back\nDon't know if they'll get it right, but I know that we'll get it last\nMight as well go spend a rack at a black-owned business\nHad my mind on hoes, now I'm back on business, that's real\nBack to what's important, I'ma build with you\nCause you're here for me and I'm here with you\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm here with you\nI'm here with you\nI'm here with you\n\n[Outro]\nYou never thought I'd make it this far, did you\nYou always had to make it hard for me\nBut I'm a motherfuckin' star, bitch didn't you know?\nCan't you hear that applause for me?\nCan't you hear that applause for me?\nCan't you hear that applause for me?\nCan't you hear that applause for me?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e25804a8bf23b37fcf6a7fedf408b30e.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2016-03-04", "title": "Black Owned Business", "album": "Too High to Riot"}]}
