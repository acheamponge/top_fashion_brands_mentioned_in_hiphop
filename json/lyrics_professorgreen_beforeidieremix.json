Is that the best you can do?\nSame situation but put it on a plane, in the first class section, perfection's game\nTake your pick from the air stewardesses, lock off the cabin, remove their dresses\nGHB can replace the gack, or make things slick if you abuse the crack\nBottles up vaginas are fine if you're entertaining, but use champagne\nNot wine and you'll find that the bubbles excite em, the pleasure is heightened, believe me\nYou'll be closer to heaven, and to finish with style, parachute from the plane like you're 007\"\nYou can't beat that for originality, everything you dreamt of, make reality\nI thought I'd done it all but I've missed all sorts, before I'm a corpse, there's so much to see\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2006-12-01"}]}
