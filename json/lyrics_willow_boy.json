This is wack\nIs love just torment?\nBut they say life has a silver lining\nAnd I say I will find it my way\n'Cause down on Earth theres so much pain\nAnd way up here there's galaxies\n\n[Verse 3]\nHey God, are you there? I need to talk\nI feeling love is here and then is not\nWe hysterically cry when we wake up in the morning\nCould you please tell us why life feels like torment?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ebf33ad9f0ce439a78767dec14ad53e6.960x960x1.jpg", "album": "The 1st", "title": "Boy"}]}
