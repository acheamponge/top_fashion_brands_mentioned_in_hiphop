That's enough to live life we wanna live\nI can count, a couple cars, a few broads, and a crib\nI can count, it's simple math homie, this ain't trig\nI can count, that's enough for us to do it big\nI can count, don't lose count\nDon't lose count\nDon't lose count\nDon't lose count\n\n[Verse 1:]\nOkay, all my homies ridin' clean, it's only right we do the same\nKeep my eyes open, just in case they play that murder game\nShit I don't trip, collect my chips and get my ass on\nDid without my childhood years, so I get my mash on\nRather sit back, count stacks, and fuck groupie hoes\nStop smokin' bud on occasion, we blowing stupid 'dro\nNever been the type to trip, but today we go stupid though\nHe ain't grown up to be me, so you don't even know\nMakin' hurricane to the point they can't see the flow\nUsed to have a lot to say, but haters they don't speak no more\nShut down the street kitchen, niggas they can't eat no more\nDo this like 24/7, so we don't sleep no more\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 2:]\nOkay, you get a mil today, my nigga that's a mil tomorrow\nI'm your local hood bank, if you need mils to borrow\nNo credit, no debit, I can deal with it\nIf you can't pay, don't lie, keep it real with it\nEverybody wanna be a king or a kingpin\nYou a king, I'm a king, fuck it we all kings then\nDid to me, all about your cavalry, and your king's men\nSome niggas that will die for your shit that you believe in\nMoney just a tool, nigga, to find more time\nTo get more money, to get money and then die\nI said:\nMoney just a tool, to buy a nigga more time\nTo get more money, gonna blow it all and then die\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nOkay, everybody got a dream, while I'm just getting mine\nEither you risk it all and ball or you just getting by\nAre you the type to go all in, and you don't even try\nAre you the dope boy in your life or are you just getting high?\nAre you the dope boy in your life or are you just getting high?\nAre you the dope boy in your life or are you just getting high?\nI'm trying to tell you a little something you don't get in school\nBy any means necessary, get money when the bills are due\nGet money when you need some food to feed you and your family too\nDon't worry 'bout your kids cause clearly half of them ain't feeling you\nFact that you get old should be the only thing that's killing you\nAnd stay out of grown folk biz, cause that's what children do\nPut God first and your awards will come in large amounts\nNow go outside and play and don't bother me man, I'm losing count\n\n[Hook:]"}], "artist": "Big K.R.I.T."}
