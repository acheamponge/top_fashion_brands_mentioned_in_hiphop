I know a walking corpse who'd spit icicle dagger to slit throat\nQuicker than you can prove there's four letters in hope (H-O-P-E)\nI paint a portrait from my cell called life inside the tortoise shell\nTortured\nOrbiting hell's orchard intrigued but not compelled\nI smell a hint of charred child flesh sweeping through my quarters\nOrder one canteen of liquid caffeine and eclipse the slaughter\nNow is you is the villain of my kabuki hologram\nCuz I hobble with hollow hands\nPlease pan the nozzle\nWe see intent to re-invent dream application with homage to ancients\nBut honor modern replacements circling now basics\nI'm Bilbo Baggins with stilts tipping the Petri dish (fresh)\nBeached fish on the shores where the feast of wits eat the corpse\nDivvy the servings and study the traits that deemed killer breed credible\nThat's a harp of a different color but the song remains identical\nI am not a crook\nI cook the wick at both ends\nJust to blend that element of chance with my tight rope dance\nLife\nSight beyond\nFire ant with a hunger pain gut be gone\nBelong to something civil, saint, cuz this Rembrandt paints on\nAnd it's a cold canvas lodged in the gut of Atlantis\nSome present impressive lung, some truly learn what a death chant is\nI alone personify mankind's collective sulk\nAs a result of one angry Zeus fist blistering cult pulp in bulk\nFace it\nDie\nPlace it on the shelf next to the portrait mommy gave you of the day it rained\nBut y'all posed by the slave ship anyway\nMake it rain 'til the levy breaks\nMy fetus breeds as a combine of father time and his sweetest concubine, wine\nAnd it saddens me like televised casualties\nI'll be hung in the village square in exactly 5 minutes;\nYou don't want to miss it\nAs a token of my discontent regarding the equation\nI'm officially closed for consultation\n\n[Hook]\nI float; while everyone around me's busy drowning...", "title": "Float", "album": "Float", "image": "https://i.genius.com/097177ea52f6ad0147914b68157107a588f47fb2?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mushrecords.com%2Falbum_art_front%2FMH202_D.jpg", "year": "2000-09-05"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
