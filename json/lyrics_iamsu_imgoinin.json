Pardon? Smack em in the front\nCause these rappers behind, I'm ahead of the curve\nYeah I came from the Rich, but I live in the 'burbs\nGot a soul full of anger so please leave me alone\nHoes know I'm a dawg, but they don't throw me the bone\nI just throw em the bone, Kelly Jones my cologne\nYou can't kill my vibe,be cause I live in the zone\nHail Mary I'm scary, I will to no fairies\nI make these rappers look so unnecessary\nI'm me just new and improved\nHandle my biz as cold as it gets, I do what I do\nRappers quick with the tongue, real slow with the trigger\nLive they life through a rhyme, with a cup full of liquir\nBut I keep em 1-thuo-e, swag on Maui\nThe way ya boy do it got these haters like \"How he?\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/94db5c57f2d884ec0822605d037d542b.383x383x1.jpg", "album": "T-Minus", "year": null}]}
