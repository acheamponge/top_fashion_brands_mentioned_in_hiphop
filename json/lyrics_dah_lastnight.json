{"songs": [{"lyrics": "My crib smells of best trees and mahogany\nBreathe smelling like Hennesse and lobster\nThat's why your bitch so fond of me\nReal pimp shit player, don't act like you ain't know\nGot a boss bitch, fuck I look like with some skank hoe?\nCounting my bankrolls, Jose Canseco\nHow I hit it out the park\nFuck with bad hoes, only hit 'em after dark\nCause see in the daytime I grind\nClearly getting what's mine\nQuarters, nickels, dimes, and dollas\nIf you need something then holler\nOnly 'bout my paper though\nWhat the fuck was you thinking? I'm smoking and drinking\nI want something then like a pirate I take it\nIt's a cold world someone get 'em a blanket\nJeez, at ease, I'm high up off these trees\nIt's tasting like it's diesel, Dan said it was sour cheese\nI believed 'em\nPut it in the jar, departed to the cave\nNow I'm in front this mic recording shit I'll do onstage\nAnd I'll prolly be getting paid\nBut that's just what I see in the future\nAnd this life that I'm leading alluring\nCause money and weed ain't that hard to get used to\nWord is bond yeah, I'm on that\nThat Hiroshima bomb rap\nThat I just smoked a eighth of weed and hash up out this bong\nI can't control it, power I gotta hold it\nRespect I have it, money, tryna stack more\nI was a pharaoh in my past life\nI went to sleep and had a dream I sat and counted a million cash\nJust, just, just (Last Night)\nYeah so", "album": "ChRon Burgundy", "year": "2011-07-23", "title": "Last Night", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/8b20b2e431b6ff249b9a84387b2bf8d5.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Da$H"}
