Buy it\nUh, I understand if you don't buy it\nSupporters need the supporters who go find it\nBut for now I'ma go fly and\nI'm so high that you won't find me so don't try it\n\n[Hook: Styalz Fuego]\nEither the sky is falling down\nOr that's me flying up again\nThe sky is falling\nI see the sky is falling down\nOr they got me going up again\nThe sky is falling\nI'm falling again\n\n[Bridge: 360 & Styalz Fuego]\n'Cause, even when I'm falling, I'm flying\nThe sky is falling\n'Cause, even when I'm falling, I'm flying\nI know you're trying call me\nDown, down (the sky is falling)\nBefore the sky can reach the ground\n\n[Hook: Styalz Fuego]\nEither the sky is falling down\nOr that's me flying up again\nThe sky is falling\nI see the sky is falling down\nOr they got me going up again\nThe sky is falling\nI'm falling again\n\n[Outro: Styalz Fuego]\nSky is falling"}]}
