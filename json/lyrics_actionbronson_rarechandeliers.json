{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAll I want to do is buy boots, ride coupe, hide loot\nUh, flick chives in the soup\nStick knives where you poop\nBackflips off the ledge, hang-glide off the roof\nLand on one leg, see me all up on the front page\nHolding a pump gauge, ready to dump, aim\nAt your nuts, like the mouth of a whore\nSomersault Cadillac on the door\nI been gorgeous, good friends with the florist\nTransportin' work in the Sequoia\nNow the chandeliers inside the foyer, feet wrapped in snake\nThe rug gotta hibernate, jacket tryna find a mate (sex)\nChoke a duck, lay it on the plate (roasted)\nSnap my fingers for the waiter come and pour the grapes (toasted)\nWhat's the word baby? (slow motion)\nOnly vision out my home window (all ocean)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSuede kicks, shootin' ball at the park (swish)\nThousand on the free throw, you just a Webelow\nI'm a full-grown human, half my leg covered in Ewings\nYou know a pussy gettin' ruined to the point where it doesn't even work\nTaz and Bugs Bunny on the shirt\nHop up in the Jag and skirt\nWhile I show you how the magic work\nTake a bastard lay him down in dirt\nAim at your apple with the archery\nChef with the tweezers place the parsley for me\nPerson in the travel car seat's a G\nI'm gettin' V while you home beatin' meat\nCan I sense I'm a stud\nDrink the blood of the snake\nBurn a fake at the stake\nDrinkin' grapes with the steak\nMake a cake for your wake\nJamaican dancers on your face rockin' 8's", "title": "Rare Chandeliers", "album": "Rare Chandeliers ", "image": "https://images.genius.com/20bdbefccfb30aac00800f75ffc6462d.507x507x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
