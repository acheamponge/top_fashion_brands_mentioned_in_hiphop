Is it really?\nIs it real? Is it really really?\nIs it real? Is it really? is it really really?\nIs it real? Is it really? is it really really?\nIs it real? Is it really? is it really really?\n\n[Verse 2: Elucid]\nPact sealed with cemetery silence\nThis is me you and this room and bearing witness\nThis is not my body\nHowever you move I'm behind\nAny decision you commit to\nThere's no windows in this waiting room\nNobody should have to leave here alone\nSo many different stories\nA common thread\nWe're all on the final chapter\nSmall talk with strangers awkward laughter\nLowering my eyes\nI'm not sure how to really feel if I was being real\nCocktail of relief and guilt got my stomach in knots\nWatching the clock second hand stopped\nWhy the fuck is there a TV here playing\nRob Schneider movies on loop\nHunger pang I fast in solidarity\nThe air is stale\nColor drab\nDeath surrounds us all with a familiar squeeze\nWe come in need making offerings\nThe prayers go up and the blessing come running down red\nThe prayers go up and the blessing come running down red\n\n[Outro]"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
