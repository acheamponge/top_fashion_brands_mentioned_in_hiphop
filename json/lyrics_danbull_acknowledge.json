My lines'll leave your hopes high as kites\nIncite delight like a cherry bright sky at night\nThis vocal's for locals who are frightened in their neighbourhood\nRefrain from leaving home at night; afraid of violent raping muggers\nFor the same buggers doing crime to pay for drugs\nIt never meant to end this way, you're stuck; pain sucks\nChange looks like something that'll never happen\nBut if I let that thinking win, I'd never end up rapping\nFor those in prison, those who did and those who didn't\nThe victims that they did it to and those who witnessed it\nFor those who overcome their hopeless bitterness to show forgiveness\nWhether you do or don't is no-one's business\nFor those who wish to string them up until they know their miseries\nLife's a winding hillside road and the slope is slippy\nFor the people upon the picket lines\nMiners who down their pick and strike\nStrive for a different life\nFor the silent majority\nTightening your waistline to prop up an economy\nYou probably hadn't a problem with til the bottom dropped off of it\nBut now you're picking up the tab and haven't got a tip\n\n[Verse 3: Dan Bull]\nThis is for the elderly, sitting in their chairs alone\nOr bedridden in a bug ridden nursing home\nA verse devoted to you, and who you truly are\nThe same you that you've ever been, I've seen you shoot for the stars\nBut gravity ravages things savagely\nSo let my lyrics lift your spirits up from incapacity\nCause I'm the captain of this flagship actually\nAnd you're a VIP invited to fly the galaxy with me\nThis is for the carers, looking after another\nI understand you want to be more than just a mother\nHow can you have a lover, or any other life\nIf you couldn't find someone else to come and grab the cover?\nChanging a duvet's much easier with two, hey?\nWednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday\nFor those stuck at home, chronic illness, health problems\nA lot of guilt makes you want to kill yourself often\nWhat little help I can offer to soften the blow?\nCan't invent anything off of the top of the dome\nBut you've not been forgotten and I just want you to know\nWherever you are, my flow will boldly go\nI swear by the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost\nJehovah, Allah, Muhammad, whoever holds the most\nControl over the souls of the unappreciated\nIt will keep ebbing away every day that people play this shit\n\n[Outro]\nI try to recognise\nThose who've been left aside\nCome aboard my enterprise, and boldly...\nI try to recognise\nThose who've been left aside\nCome aboard my enterprise, and boldly...", "year": "2014-09-03"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
