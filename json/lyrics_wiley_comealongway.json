(It's not where you wanna be, you must be sure)\nSo, best thing to do is just link off, go your separate ways (Go separate ways), you get me?\n\n[Verse 1: Maverick]\nFirst off, let me make this clear\nBecause this ain't a brush-off, I ain't had enough of you\nBut for me to be true\nBut I gotta let go because of things that I do\nBecause right now, we just can't work\nKnow me, focus on just my work\nBut they say patience is a virtue\nIf I get too deep now, I might hurt you\nKnow me, I'm in the music biz, flying\nKnow how the music is\nAnd if I'm always up in the sky\nYou're not by your side\nIf you look hard, you'll see that's what useless is\nAnd it can't be like that\nBecause I'm chasing the dream and I will be right back\nBack with the cream, no need to be sidetracked\n\n[Chorus: Maverick, Wiley]\nSo don't take it the wrong way, wait\nWhen I say that it's time to leave (See the relationship, yeah?)\nGo separate ways, have time to breathe\nSo I can see what's right for me (It's long still)\nAnd we have come a long way, wait (Or nah?Yeah, or...)\nSo if it's meant to be\nYou might be more than a friend to me (Listen)\nWho knows, in the end, we'll see\n\n[Verse 2: Wiley]\nWe both do music, it's awkward\nStill, I can't stress, I gotta move forward\nAim for the sky, I'm like hiding, [?]\nMoney didn't buy then\nStraight to the airport, let's fly\nThere ain't much time but a break won't hurt\nIt's been a few months and I'm distant\nSpending time and I ain't getting noticed\nBack to England, gotta stay focused\nSee I had changes to do right, I missed them\nFor instance, when you lied the other day\nI flipped instant, said to myself, \"don't worry, just look at the scene leave your imprint\"\nAnd the blueprint, leave after that\nLook back in 5 years and breathe after that\nNext time cross paths, it might work\nMaybe we'll be after that\n\n[Chorus: Maverick, Wiley]\nSo don't take it the wrong way, wait (It's love still)\nWhen I say that it's time to leave\nGo separate ways, have time to breathe\nSo I can see what's right for me\nAnd we have come a long way, wait\nSo if it's meant to be\nYou might be more than a friend to me\nWho knows, in the end, we'll see\nSo don't take it the wrong way, wait\nWhen I say that it's time to leave\nGo separate ways, have time to breathe\nSo I can see what's right for me\nAnd we have come a long way, wait\nSo if it's meant to be\nYou might be more than a friend to me\nWho knows, in the end, we'll see\n\n[Verse 3: Maverick]\nI ain't saying it's over\nDone, if the time comes\nI hope you had won\nBut right now, I'm better off solo\nBest keep a photo, I'm rolling with some\nCase we don't come back to this spot\nBack to this house and back to this block\nBack with no laps and back at the top\nAin't no point coming back to a flop\nBecause you know it ain't fair on me\nOr fair on you, but if you need me\nJust meet me, I'll be there in two\nAnd it ain't no lie, I swear\nIt's natural and I try to care\nDon't worry about distance, I'll fly to there\nBut it's time we decide from here\nA separate journey, we ride from here\n\n[Chorus: Maverick]\nSo don't take it the wrong way, wait\nWhen I say that it's time to leave\nGo separate ways, have time to breathe\nSo I can see what's right for me\nAnd we have come a long way, wait\nSo if it's meant to be\nYou might be more than a friend to me\nWho knows, in the end, we'll see", "image": "https://images.genius.com/de7dec0da580e6983af1849e89114aef.583x583x1.jpg", "album": "Umbrella Vol 1", "title": "Come A Long Way"}]}
