Would\u2019ve slapped her if she said to talk to the palm\nShe\u2019s shaking her fucking head around, don\u2019t even got a Walkman on\nI stepped to the left, she kept looking straight\nI\u2019m like, \u201cThis bitch is blind as fuck.\u201d and stuck my middle finger in her face\nYou don\u2019t need rocket science to comprehend my views\nYou with a bitch that can\u2019t see? We\u2019re bringing the whole camera crew\nAt Saks Fifth, they ain\u2019t got shit on my surveillance\nAlan fucked with the cunt and took the tape to his parents\nLive web feed show her floppy D\u2019s do\nI know you can\u2019t see me but we can all see you\n\n[Hook]\n\nAt Cagekennylz.com, jump in the mind of madness\nAnd get shit out on the Autobahn\nI\u2019m three hundred and sixty-five Benzes\nTwo hundred and ninety-eight BM\u2019s and three Lexes\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nWhat\u2019s the best part of Jersey? Get to the city for a dollar\nWalking down Broadway, seen her tittie through the collar\nInsecure, chubby with chocolate on her celly\nPull her jugs to the neck line, her shirt shields her belly\nGot three bucks, ain\u2019t making dinner out of chips\nIf I get in this cow\u2019s lap I can feast and fuck some tits\nI\u2019m like, \u201cHi.\u201d that was all it took for bait\nShe threw me on her back and sprinted to the lab but stopped for cakes\nMy hand\u2019s full of tit on her couch unable to bend her\nAfter a Thanksgiving meal and it\u2019s fucking December\nFuck the H\u00e4agen-Dazs, I\u2019ve been lodged in back fat\nGo down on me, tittie cutie pie I don\u2019t do that\nShe threw a thigh the size of my torso on the back of my neck\nMade me french kiss her matted dog with its throat slit\nI\u2019m like luke in a ton ton with my fucking Timberlands hanging out the sumo\u2019s thong thong\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nI used to talk to this chick but never got to pounce her\nCause she works sixty-five hours a week as a councellor\nFor the handicapped, scooped her working at the Gap\nThe most I got in her was a finger after a fifty dollar dinner\nWent to get her from work to bring her downtown\nThat\u2019s when I bumped into Jennifer Love Hewitt with downs\nI know it\u2019s a little far-fetched but it ain\u2019t a stretch\nLike seeing famalan its textbook\nLook, y\u2019all can talk all the shit y\u2019all want\nBut even Jerry Lewis would run up in this slut for a month\nHer mindstate\u2019s like she\u2019s on drugs every hour\nMighty Mi seen me with her and I swear the fucking shit out her\n(Alex, make love to me!)\nNevermind the goofy face, it\u2019s a sport fuck to me\nI\u2019m balls deep, she starts to seizure and open wider\nI\u2019m was about to bust so I left my fucking dick inside her\n\n[Hook]"}]}
