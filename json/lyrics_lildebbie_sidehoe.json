You could dip\nWhat can I say? I'm a fool with the drip\nI'm from the Bay, it ain't new to a pimp (Uh)\nI'm just too fly, still on my shit\nSauce every way, hope he don't slip\nStay in your lane, boy, get a grip\nHe think it's Frito Lay\nI want them chips, aye\nDebbie work them all like a maestro\nIf it ain't 'bout the money hit the side phone\nI ain't looking for a man, you can try though\nI only want you on the side like fries, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nHe in love, but I treat him like a side ho\nHe be spinnin' on me like a cyclone\nBlowin' up my phone like a psycho\nGet back in your lane, you a side ho\nSide ho, side ho\nI turn a hundred baby daddies into side hoes\nGot him spinnin' on me like a cyclone\nGotta keep him in his lane with the side hoes\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're my side ho, my dear\nNo texts, no calls, let's make this shit clear\nHe says he loves me, I think he's sincere\nAnd I ain't paid a bill in about two years\nCheers, big stones in my ears\n100K or better on leather when I steer\nHear me blocks away or when I switch gears\nHouse in the woods, I might hit a deer\nDon't cry me a river, no feelings, no tears\nBuy me a river and let's disappear\nFor the weekend, my beloved cashier\nYou know I'm talented, so fund my career, yeah\nCash, no debit\nGet the best interest rate, he got great credit\nI break him 'til he's broke, I'm unapologetic\nCall the paramedics, them pockets need a medic\nI'm killin' 'em\n\n[Chorus]\nHe in love, but I treat him like a side ho\nHe be spinnin' on me like a cyclone\nBlowin' up my phone like a psycho\nGet back in your lane, you a side ho\nSide ho, side ho\nI turn a hundred baby daddies into side hoes\nGot him spinnin' on me like a cyclone\nGotta keep him in his lane with the side hoes"}], "artist": "Lil Debbie"}
