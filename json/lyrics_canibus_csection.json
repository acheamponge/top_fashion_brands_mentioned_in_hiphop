Come on dude, I should slap you fool\nSpit what, I'll leave your lips numb the friction is so sick son\nYour chin'll disappear from attrition\nRhythmic high intensity conflict is a given it\nEspecially if Canibus is doin the rippin\nYou snipping to clipping in the C-section incisions\nWith scissors with rubber ergonomic grip for the fingers\nLiars for hire with a defense like Geoffrey Fieger\nAnd rock it like thugs who work for Mic Club\nHyped up, tear the mic up my man\nAnd move forward as expeditiously as I can\nAin't nobody in the world like Bis\nThe nitrous with radio telescopic devices, same type shit\nFacially hairless, a gregarious Jamaican-American\nLyricist turned microphone terrorist\nAirlift me off the front line to my therapist\nSo I can sit in his chair and tell him how much I care for this\nThis is what they want, this is what they love\nTo engage in the exchange of ideas and drugs\nWhile I'm in the cut satellite tracking you rappers\nWith months of food rations beneath the Catacombs of Paris\nTheories of super-lattice and super-savage\nAtomic attack tachometers flash when I punch the gas bitch\nThe farther I climb the harder I rhyme\nYou gotta face death and survive to feel more alive\nThe quality of life is an illusion of the mind\nSuper-imposed lines look two-dimensional from the side\nAccording to the science of the C-section applied\nIf they say I'm the best after I die - don't be surprised\nI C-section the sky let my energy rise\nAt the moment of truth I know it's definitely my time\nAs my soul is eased through the sieve I'll be grateful because I lived\nThe only drawback is that I didn't have kids\nTo C-section my beautiful wiz\nAnd see the resemblance of my face in hers or his\nWho knows what the future will bring, it stresses me to think\nThis mic meant everything now it doesn't seem important\nNow I gotta follow orders, defend borders\nFrom Maine to California, Seattle to Florida\nIf I could talk to the Oracle I know what I'd ask her\nI'd speak to her about my passions\nAs the hourglasses turn and my life passes\nI'll just wait 'til I see the Master and I'll just ask him\nForget it, that's the future, this is the present\nA message to anybody listening to the C section\n\n[Hook]\nThis is the 'C' Section, ripping and wrecking\nThe lyrical legend sending y'all to Mic Club heaven\nThis is the 'C' Section\nA lyrical legend, second to none in this profession\nThis is the 'C' Section, ripping and wrecking\nThe lyrical legend sending y'all to Mic Club heaven\nThis is the 'C' Section\nA lyrical legend, second to none in this profession"}]}
