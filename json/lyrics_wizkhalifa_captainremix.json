What's happenin?\nI could fuck ya bitch, no cappin'\nNiggas think they real til they lackin'\nYou ain't gettin' money 'less you stackin'\nNiggas hate me I imagine\nNo I don't do shit average\nIn a minute I'ma get shit smackin'\nUpfront we ain't dealing with no back end\nWhat's happenin? What's happenin?\nAll these niggas really care about is fashion\nDon't even ask to hit the weed, you ain't matchin'\nHow they gang? Is the question that I'm askin'\n\n[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]\nOne shot, two shots\nI done mixed McQueen with the Blue Dot\nThug life, 2Pac\nSmoke me a J on the roof top\nChampagne, campaign\nSpent a whole day on a airplane\nBarely get my team on the airplane\nBarely get my luggage on the airplane\nLookin' at me like the captain\nThey treat me, like the captain\nKnow where I'm goin' like the captain\nShow up when I want like the captain\nEverywhere I go I'm the captain\nEverywhere I go I'm the captain\nEverywhere I go I'm the captain\nEverywhere I go I'm the captain\n\n[Verse 2: Smokepurpp]\nWhat's happenin?
