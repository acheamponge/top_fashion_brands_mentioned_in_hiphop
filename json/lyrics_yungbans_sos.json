Pussy ass niggas tellin' names\nAyy, fuck ass nigga, you to blame\nStreets made me who I am, who I became\nShe wanna kick it with a star, we can go to Mars\nI just popped these Percs, don't pop no bars, say oh my God\nDon't mean to be rude, don't mean to bombard\nI smashed your ho, I'm fuckin' your broad\nShe throwin' that neck, I'm makin' her nod\nShe know I be in love with no thot\n\n[Chorus]\nMaster on these hoes, let 'em know, SOS\nHundred thousand dollar 'round my neck, make her undress\nKnow some young niggas take your soul for a lil' check\nSlide on 'em in a space coupe, no Star Trek\nMaster on these hoes, let 'em know, SOS\nHundred thousand dollar 'round my neck, make her undress\nKnow some young niggas take your soul for a lil' check\nSlide on 'em in a space coupe, no Star Trek\n\n[Outro]\nWheezy outta here\nDJ on the beat so it's a banger", "title": "SOS"}]}
