What else\nI hate to say goodbye, I do not know how, this is not good\nSounds and hallucinations very bad, are ... bad\nThe four of us were different poles, no romance of course\n\nChromosomes melting, making me stupid, I'm stupid, honey\n\nBetter call the hospital, I bleed and I do not feel my heart", "album": "Sad boys"}], "artist": "SadBoyTaki"}
