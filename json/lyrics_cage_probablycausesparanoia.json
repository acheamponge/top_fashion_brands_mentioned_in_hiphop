All your states are altered and you see God.\nEmbalming (skips) fluid are you kidding me? I've smelled that shit it's like lethal...\nHey what was he on? Some weird shit I don't really know...\nI heard that he smoked a joint dipped in embalming fluid...\nYeah I wouldn't know...\nThat wouldn't be embalming fluid that you stole from my house right?\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you?"}]}
