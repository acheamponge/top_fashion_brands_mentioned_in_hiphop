Blige: Verse 2]\nI pray and pray for life's salvation\nFaith is tried and true in tribulation\nLove is lost and lonely, check the news\nAnd with these open arms I'll wait for you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[T.I: Verse 2]\nFor the life of me, I can't see how the devil keeps enticing me\nAll u sees a felon, I know god can see whats right in me\nHow I can be labeled as a villain in the first place\nWhen the worst case senerio is my birth place\nI'm just trying to keep from falling victim to the murder rate\nTake my life lesson convincing the adolescents\nThere's a god up in heaven, sending down blessings\nAnd your future ain't brighter than your present\nQuit Stressing\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThey re screaming on the left\nYelling on the right\nWhile i'm sitting in the middle trying to live my life\n\n[Chorus]\nBecause I can't stop the war\nShelter homeless, feed the poor\nCan't walk on water I can't save your sons and daughters\nI can't change the world to make things fair\nThe least that I can do is care\n\n[Outro]\nYeah I can't stop the war\nShelter homeless feed the poor\nI can't walk on water\nI can't save your sons and daughters\nI can't change the world and make things fair\nThe least that I can do[x3]\nOh is CARE"}]}
