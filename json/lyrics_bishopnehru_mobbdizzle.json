I'll have ya baked breaking easy\nBelieve me, Bishop is illy, tracks stay on repeat\nI defeat, any nigga ready to contest, yes I do impress\nI'm next look to invest, never stress when adressing the best\nIt's sess ses till I rest imma bless and finesse nothing less\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nNothing less than a doctor, only spot for me\nAin't hard to see I spark trees when we park the V\nImpossibly, paused to see who's higher [?]\nAsk [?] they yell Bishop the reviver\nWho's liver? Nobody that you probably think\nTheir rhymes are extinct, we try to let em slide but they sink\nCause diamond and minks, take over their cranium\nSo ain't nobody playing em, they stay strayin em\nStraight delaying em, we need to pray for em\nIf not, you lost your noggin, rappers I'm bothering\nFlow cold like snow toboggan, they try to bog in for life\nThe mic is my knife, prepare for the cyph your flow born from a cyph\nIt's alright, I told you fuck it stay out of sight\nIt's like, when I be flowing don't you put up a fight\nYou born in the night, I asked for a light from the flight\nAnd niggas surely be hype when there's blood in the pipe\nNow that's life\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Reversed Outro]"}], "artist": "Bishop Nehru"}
