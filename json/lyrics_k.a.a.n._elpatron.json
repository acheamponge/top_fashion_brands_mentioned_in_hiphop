homie look around\nI don't see nobody on my level\nWhy the niggas say they working but they not, and why they always talk a lot\nAnd what the fuck you talk about, and why you always talk about\nSome shit you know you never got, some shit you know you never did in life you know you never lived\nYou was at your mama crib watching Narcos\nCause you the motherfucking man with a plan, I guess\nWrap it up, I need it pronto got a nigga feeling like Pablo\nPronto, said I need a pronto, got a nigga feeling like Pablo\nWrap it up, I need it pronto, said I need it pronto, got a nigga feeling like Pablo\nYou the motherfucking man with plan, I guess nah you another broke nigga lying bout a check\nNigga you ain't gotta flex\nI know you don't do it like Pablo\nYou watch too much Narcos\n\n[K.A.A.N.] Verse 1\nI killed some niggas and buried them where you'll never find em\nI sold some crack and than I slapped a bitch with a broken vinyl\nI ran a credit card scam with my best friend\nI ran off on the plug with some keys, and then got it in\nI recently received just enough to lease me a Benz\nI'll tint the windows and get some rims, guess what I spent?\nThe payments cost so much, a step is what you'd like to slip\nThe sarcastic side of this sign I feel something else\nI'm sure I'll sell some records if I sell myself short\nRest assured, I can't convort to the other side of the force\nOr resort to go in the store\nThey twist up the truth that's the proof of promise the pushes, a proven prominent leader\nIt's my way or the highway, I'm leaving you where I found ya\nMy shit is deep enough to reach the depths of the Atlantic\nIt's way over your head but the point is I'm at advantage\nI'm feasting upon the feeble that fill me up when I'm famished\nI fend off families of four with a form that was foreign to ya\nI found my way through the door and the foyer forcing an entrance\nBack and forth with a swing and a miss like that shit was tennis\nI'm incapable of love, I would always be the winner\nYou was so put in Wimbledon, I win it twice, then win again\nThe subtleties of my soliloquies are breezing like the wind\nI'm prone to plead the fifth, I'm accurate I never miss\nA gargantuan dissertation, an author for explanation\nMy signature's affirmation like sealing the affidavit\nMy daily dilemma entails this:\nNow should I roll me up a blunt or should I call me a bitch?\nI told her bring a pack of 'rillos and a couple of friends\nAnd we'll fornicate and face your foreign flowers and floral patterns and green pastures\nWhile passing the faintest fragrance, i'm painting the vaguest picture\nLike my current predecessors, they're predatorial figures\nFor editorial gimmicks and fallacies for an image\n\n[Hook]\nI said homie look around\nI don't see nobody on my level\nWhy the niggas say they working but they not, and why they always talk a lot\nAnd what the fuck you talk about, and why you always talk about\nSome shit you know you never got, some shit you know you never did in life you know you never lived\nYou was at your mama crib watching Narcos\nCause you the motherfucking man with a plan, I guess\nWrap it up, I need it pronto got a nigga feeling like Pablo\nPronto, said I need a pronto, got a nigga feeling like Pablo\nWrap it up, I need it pronto, said I need it pronto, got a nigga feeling like Pablo\nYou the motherfucking man with plan, I guess nah you another broke nigga lying bout a check\nNigga you ain't gotta flex\nI know you don't do it like Pablo\nYou watch too much Narcos\n\n[K.A.A.N.] Verse 2\nI'm an animal baby, I've got this evil inside me\nI'll explicitly explain the process of asphyxiation\nFirst you find the weakest victim, for instance\nIt's Monday evening\nI'm feeling the force of blade through your flesh\nI testify over open fires, the feelings are found\nThere's blood dripping from my silhouette\nIt's cynical, I'm sitting with a sin or two\nI made the sound that's to infuse\nExcept the words I wrote for you\nI'm vocal, very vexed I affect the fake with the real\nI'm literally inept to emotions that you reveal\nI'm sending salutations, so from my side of the hill\nThere's a villa for vast consumptions\nIntegrate for mass assumptions\nI summon sickening rituals, my cauldron started bubblin'\nMy rhetoric will render residue that runneth over\nMy recipe is simple, resonating keep composure\nBut rest assured my legacy is laced while I say asterisk\nI asked the man above for leniency, but see my blasphemies\nAre blatant with my lack of apathy, erratic temperament\nI'm terribly confused, they knew the truth was for the youth\nBut what's the use as I am wasting my breath\nIt seems nobody gives a fuck, and that shit fine by me\nCause honestly my conscious died around the age of 18\nFew dispute I'm losing sanity and entering euphoria, receding lucid dreams and out of body experiences is indescribable, I advise you respect the vision,nigga\n\n[K.A.A.N. ]Hook"}], "artist":
