Feel like I just met you\nAt the carnival, you fed me a pretzel\nAnd you like it from the back, make ill noises\nAss is incredible, pussy is the moistest\nDamn, it's all good, I bought you a ring\nBut marriage, nah, love, respect my thing\nI wouldn't do that you, nor to myself\nYou signing papers to me, that's something else\nBut we can get the house, the whips and the seeds\nSeven day, eight night, cruises to Belize\nIt's all in the budget, you like it, I love it\nBut rumors about me and the street, stay above it\nI travel a lot, bitches babble alot\nSee the way I treat you, you lick the spot\nYou with the God, wisdom, strength and beauty\nCivilizing savages, my everyday duty\nLive free, make money, young black male\nMost niggas like me is dead or in jail\nI'm from the gutter, treat my wiz like I treat my mother\nRespect for me, come check for me\nYou isn't scared of the fact, I kept a tech with me\nPlus you hold it, you even asked me to teach you how to load it\nJust 'case one day, I need you to explode it\nThat's raw, I never seen it in a wiz before\nAnd you lady like, stay wet all night\nScreaming like a baby, when I'm giving you the pipe\nI'm good, that's gully, no more running the street\nI got a dime piece at home, smart, laying sweet\nSatin sheets, living life of the peak\nIntelligent at work, and a bed pure freak\nI speak for engineers, hustlers, athletes\nBusinessmen that travel, be gone for weeks\nGetting money, come home, shit is intact\nJust being around me, you get percentage of that\nJust when my flight leave, know it's coming back\nRound trip, baby..."}], "artist": "La The Darkman"}
