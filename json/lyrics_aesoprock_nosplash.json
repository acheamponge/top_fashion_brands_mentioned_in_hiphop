{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Aesop Rock]\nJanuary, I fell to the cobblestone\nIn April, I cut little paper flowers\nIn August, I drank cold tea all my lonesome\nIn October, I was introduced as coward\nI love New York Saturdays\nBut Mondays last longer\nAnd since I plan to live a long life\nMaybe I'll serve a thousand Mondays and swallow the burn\nTo merge the week for all its got\nTo give my shoddy rotten ribs (thick forgot my ribs)\nI got a lil' something called a spirit crisis on my skull\nAnd it's nothing short of ferocious but I swallowed the dosage\nI got a mantle, and the mantle is a candle\nAnd my candle is a flame that burns to symbolize the day Gretel met Hansel\nThen I settle in a stand still\nI live forever reaching for the sun\nHoping some lucky day I'll clutch and get a handful\nRope ladder, I'm a swinging anvil\nAnd I wanna turn skullies and tummies with pretty lullaby, bye\nThe way my gypsy dances makes a monster retreat to fetal\nI never felt so damn young\nBut you don't look a day over zero\nAnd you don't look a day in its eyes cuz it'll make you realize\nThe night is near so\nWell then go, dream, I clean around the edges\nI tidy up the tabletop, and lectured all the pledges\nI never really knew the true definition of precious\nTill my angel wit the beautiful red locks gave me the message\nI'm a fully animated life tree\nSee the root of the mute button was dug up bug up on a song\nOf I'm a fully animated life tree\nWith branches for the heavens to admire naturally\n\nChorus [Woman speaking]\nFame, war, love, honor, crime, innocence, tragedy, sunshine\nCringe, death, passion, heroism, God, suffering, joy, fate\nDestiny, treasure, stars, gall, hunger, murder, silence, mayhem\nHealth, pain, suspense, breath, sound, guilt, pride, time\n\n[Aesop Rock]\nWe all know what a halo is\nBut we all don't know the horrors if your halo tips\nI be the matador making your pretty little heels click\nI be the Sword in the Stone of the contemporary eclipse\nI'm incredibly exhausted\nYou can't imagine, got my warm spirit stuck in my teeth, I'm obsolete\nFreedom freedom freedom fighter beginning\nFor the sake of better demeanor and such to bust, fucking fantastic\nEvery little step she takes breaks the chambers\nIn the chest, developed in the abomidable trouble\nSettle for a cruel second, loud for an hour\nScreamin to the beats to leave until my whole weekend turns sour\nI ain't been around the world but I been around the block\nI ain't seen everything but I seen enough to talk\nI ain't a prophet, I ain't the Second Coming of Christ\nI'm just a mason with a will to build and a little advice\nI wanna weave a web, I bought a set of knitting needles\nFiddling with a theme, dream solid\nPaddle in the hole-in-the-bottom dingy to where the portraits astonish\nYou won't regret a single solitary step, I promise\nLook, in a situation where a dragon guards the gate\nI make a true spur of the moment grown decision\nWhich in turn allows me to be something normal\nWith the prefix of the 'ab' and\nI can kill every monster if I gotta, that's that\nRockin' it, rockin' it, clippership rockin' it\nBe the little guinea pig, dig?\nI'm tryin to make an exit with no ripples in the water\nNo splash, let the poison slide down down the hatch\nIt's like that\n\nChorus 2x", "title": "No Splash", "album": "Float", "image": "https://i.genius.com/097177ea52f6ad0147914b68157107a588f47fb2?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mushrecords.com%2Falbum_art_front%2FMH202_D.jpg", "year": "2000-09-05"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
