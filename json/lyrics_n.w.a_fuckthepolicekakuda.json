{"songs": [{"lyrics": "Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect\nJudge Dre presiding\nIn the case of N.W.A. vs. the Police Department;\nProsecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube, and Eazy-motherfucking-E\n\n[Dr. Dre as The Judge]\nOrder, order, order\nIce Cube, take the motherfucking stand\nDo you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth to help your black ass?\n\n[Ice Cube as Witness]\nYou goddamn right!\n\n[Dr. Dre]\nWell won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?\n\n[Ice Cube]\nFuck the police coming straight from the underground\nA young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown\nAnd not the other color so police think\nThey have the authority to kill a minority\nFuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one\nFor a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun\nTo be beating on, and thrown in jail\nWe can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell\nFucking with me 'cause I'm a teenager\nA little bit of gold and a pager\nSearching my car, looking for the product\nThinking every nigga is selling narcotics\nYou'd rather see, me in the pen\nThan me and Lorenzo rollin in a Benz-o\nBeat a police out of shape\nAnd when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape\nTo tape off the scene of the slaughter\nStill getting swole off bread and water\nI don't know if they fags or what\nSearch a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts\nAnd on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none\nBut don't let it be a black and a white one\n'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top\nBlack police showing out for the white cop\nIce Cube will swarm\nOn any motherfucker in a blue uniform\nJust 'cause I'm from, the CPT\nPunk police are afraid of me!\nHUH, a young nigga on the warpath\nAnd when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath\nOf cops, dying in L.A\nYo Dre, I got something to say\n\nFuck the police [4x]\n\nExample of scene one\n\n[Cop] Pull your goddamn ass over right now\n[NWA] Aww shit, now what the fuck you pulling me over for?\n[Cop] 'Cause I feel like it! Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up\n[NWA] Man, fuck this shit\n[Cop] Aight smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!\n\n[Dr. Dre]\nMC Ren, will you please give your testimony to the jury about this fucked-up incident?\n\n[MC Ren]\nFuck the police and Ren said it with authority\nBecause the niggas on the street is a majority\nA gang is with whoever I'm stepping\nAnd the motherfucking weapon is kept in\nA stash box for the so-called law\nWishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw\nLights start flashing behind me\nBut they're scared of a nigga\nSo they mace me to blind me\nBut that shit don't work, I just laugh\nBecause it gives em a hint, not to step in my path\nFor police, I'm saying, \"Fuck you punk!\"\nReading my rights and shit, it's all junk\nPulling out a silly club, so you stand\nWith a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand\nBut take off the gun so you can see what's up\nAnd we'll go at it punk, and I'mma fuck you up!\nMake you think I'mma kick your ass\nBut drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast\nI'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime\nBut I'mma smoke 'em now and not next time\nSmoke any motherfucker that sweats me\nOr any asshole that threatens me\nI'm a sniper with a hell of a scope\nTaking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me\nThe motherfucking villain that's mad\nWith potential to get bad as fuck\nSo I'mma turn it around\nPut in my clip, yo, and this is the sound\nYeah, something like that\nBut it all depends on the size of the gat\nTaking out a police, would make my day\nBut a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say\n\nFuck the police [4x]\n\n[NWA] Yeah man, what you need?\n[Cop] Police, open now\n[NWA] Aww shit\n[Cop] We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest\n[Cop] Get down and put your hands up where I can see 'em (Move motherfucker, move now!)\n[NWA] What the fuck did I do, man what did I do?\n[Cop] Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)\n[NWA] But I didn't do shit\n[Cop] Man just shut the fuck up!\n\n[Dr. Dre]\nEazy-E, won't you step up to the stand and tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?\n\n[Eazy-E]\nI'm tired of the motherfucking jacking\nSweating my gang, while I'm chilling in the shack, and\nShining the light in my face, and for what?\nMaybe it's because I kick so much butt\nI kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast\nOn a stupid-ass nigga\nWhen I'm playing with the trigger\nOf an Uzi or an AK\n'Cause the police always got something stupid to say\nThey put out my picture with silence\n'Cause my identity by itself causes violence\nThe E with the criminal behavior\nYeah, I'm a gangster, but still I got flavor\nWithout a gun and a badge, what do ya got?\nA sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot\nBy me or another nigga\nAnd with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger\n([MC Ren:] Size ain't shit, he's from the old school fool)\nAnd as you all know, E's here to rule\nWhenever I'm rolling, keep looking in the mirror\nAnd ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a\nDumb motherfucker with a gun\nAnd if I'm rolling off the 8, he'll be the one\nThat I take out, and then get away\nWhile I'm driving off laughing this is what I'll say\n\nFuck the police [4x]\n\nThe verdict\n\n[Dre] The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, white bread, chickenshit motherfucker\n[Cop] Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!\n[Dre] Get him out of here!\n[Cop] I want justice!\n[Dre] Get him the fuck out my face!\n[Cop] I want justice!\n[Dre] Out, right now!\n[Cop] Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!", "album": null, "year": null, "title": "FUCK THE POLICE - Kakuda", "image": "https://images.genius.com/627acab300f5f3fd378a3b1adf4a69f8.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "N.W.A"}
