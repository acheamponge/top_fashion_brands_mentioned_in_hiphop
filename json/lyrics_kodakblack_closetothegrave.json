Boy, you know you didn't\nI hit that lick in Maryland, I bought my mama a Honda Civic\nThe hardest thing I had to do in life was leave you\nI was showin' you love and had you feelin' like I need you\nI'm drinkin' this alcohol right now, I wanna see you\nYou made me go hard in this shit, I'm motivated\nWhy you had gave up on the kid when I was jaded?\nNow I've been drinkin', gettin' faded\nThinkin' 'bout how you played me\nThinkin' 'bout how you did me\n\n[Chorus]\nI be clutchin' on my fire, you never know these days\nGamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave\nSorry Lord, the Devil got a hold of me, lately\nKnew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, baby\nClutchin' on my fire, you never know these days\nGamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave\nSorry Lord, the Devil got a hold of me, lately\nKnew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, baby"}]}
