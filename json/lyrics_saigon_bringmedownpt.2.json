(How?)\nKnow what they saying for now?\n\n[Refrain: Saigon]\nThey say I'm a Killer\nI feel I'm as high as I can be\nAnd ya'll ain't gonna die as high as me\nI can't be no realer\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nI can't be no realer\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\n\n[Verse 2: Saigon]\nI'm too high, but it's not from a drug\nIt's not from a drink, it's not from a night at the club\nIt's not from a broad, it's not what I copped from the dealer\nI would tell ya, but if I tell ya, then I gotta kill ya\nThe Greatest Story is near, and now I'm kinda scared\nIt's ill, I'm like a vet that's still wet behind the ears\nSome niggas look hard, but I don't feel the threat behind the stares\nI'm lookin for vics' and they could be volunteers\nI dare somebody (to) jump out the window and try to stop me\nI wait for niggas and shoot em like I was a paparazzi\nThat Just Blaze'll knock in the Maserati\nI'll jump out the back and turn your block into Nagasaki\nI shouldn't have to always make an issue with the pistol\nJust to prove the kid is official tissue to the gristle\nHow does the Saigon story end? (How?)\nKnow what they saying for now?\n\n[Refrain: Saigon]\nThey say I'm a Killer\nI feel I'm as high as I can be\nAnd ya'll ain't gonna die as high as me\nI can't be no realer\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nI can't be no realer\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\n\nThey say I'm a Killer\nI feel I'm as high as I can be\nAnd ya'll ain't gonna die as high as me\nI can't be no realer\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nI can't be no realer\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down\nYa'll ain't gon bring me down", "album": "The Greatest Story Never Told"}], "artist": "Saigon"}
