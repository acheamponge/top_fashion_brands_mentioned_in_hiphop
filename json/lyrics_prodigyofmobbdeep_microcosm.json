It's a trip\nMeanwhile, back on a higher plane\nWhere real life is takin' place\nWe stay away from the lames\nWe don't let the bullshit drain us\nStay away from them basics\nAll love, no hatred\nBut we don't tolerate fools\nPlease try your call later\nGoodbye, God controls when I die\nI'ma meet God halfway and I'ma extend my life\nCase in point tryna kill me, I'm tryna kill you too\nOvercome and survive, 'cause that's what niggas do\n\n[Bridge]\nI'ma buy a Benz 'cause that's what niggas do\nYou understand me?\nI'ma smoke weed 'cause that's what niggas do\nI'ma pack a gat 'cause that's what niggas do\nYou understand me?\nI'ma get drunk 'cause that's what niggas do\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's evident I'm that nigga\nAnd I will never not be that nigga\nMy confidence is never shot\nIt doesn't go away, it's on me like some body armor\nLook into my eyes, I ain't playin' with you muh'fuckas\nBurn somethin' with your boy, let me play you these joints\nI been workin' all year, let me ball your ears\nCome check a nigga out, you know I won't let you down\nThis that number one murder sound\n1 by 1, I knocks 'em out\nAnd give less fucks than Danny Brown\nFly ass nigga, I'm a muh'fuckin' mack\nI'm way too strong, better step on that\n\n[Outro]\nWhat rap artists ain't ready for is a real person\nYou know what I wanna say, a real n-i-g-g-a\nI'ma act very black, you know what I'm sayin'?\nAnd if niggas wanna be down\nShit, it can be an all nigga thing, but if niggas don't\nShit, I'll be by my motherfuckin' self", "year": "2017-01-13"}]}
