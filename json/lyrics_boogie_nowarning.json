Uh\nAm I a barrier or am I a bridge? Uh\nYou know the scary thing about it is\nIs how I\nAlways make excuses when you wanna put time in\nTalkin' bout next week, I feel like I ain't gonna be alive then\nShe said she ready to see us die then\nSay you got all the controls, just pull the fire-pin\nLook at you killin' with mad precision\nHer brain got traffic, then I crash it, then I\nWonder if you knew how fast you'd driven, uh\nIf I turn my back to your bad decisions\nJust don't give me warning, just stab me in it\nAskin', can you not?\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't warn me (Don't, don't, don't)\nI'd rather be surprised (Don't)\nDon't warn me (Hey)\nNow I'm prepared to die, so\nSaved, don't warn me\nSaved, do-do-do-doo-do-doo\nSaved (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3e057bea64f27f9ecfbe001b0cf96345.1000x1000x1.jpg"}]}
