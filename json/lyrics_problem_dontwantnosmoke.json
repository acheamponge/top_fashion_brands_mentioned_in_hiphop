East coast to the west coast, you know I'm gonna come to check in. I hope you not giving these niggas no motherfucking room to breathe. I want your foot on they neck so motherfucking hard that they eyes start to pop out they head. You understand, my nigga. Please don't give these niggas no room. I always tell you, man, \"Don't trust no nigga that never died before.\" You hear me, one more time. \"Don't ever trust no nigga that never died before.\" 'Cause a nigga that's alive, you can't trust them. You understand and alot of niggas ain't living so alot of niggas alive to begin with. So with so many trust issue that I got that I deal with that I need you to understand that you gonna deal with the further you succeed. You an independant artist my nigga, you just preformed at the rings game, like, this shit ain't light my nigga. This shit is about greatness, this shit isn't about haters or pessimist that want to drag you down every five minutes, you got to keep fucking the baddest bitches, you got to keep taking care of your family, you got to keep doing thing for your kids, and you got to keep not letting these nigga breathe. You understand, 'cause the moment you give these motherfuckers the moment to breathe, motherfuckers are gonna blow your motherfucking food, and you can't blow on my motherfucking food 'cause you can't share my fucking food, nigga. You understand, alot of niggas are gonna ask you, \"What size sneakers you wear?\" And you got to tell them your size nigga. You understand what I'm saying. Let nigga know whatever you want to take, come take it, but if you come take something, something might get taken from you that you can never get back again. Be safe though.
