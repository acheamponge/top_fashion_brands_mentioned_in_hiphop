Cuz I just sang my sad song\nAnd you still can't believe I'm gone\nBut you know I really understand, it's hard to swallow what I said\nWhen I think about the lies you fed\nAnd it ain't all bad, it's actually all good\nKnowing that I did what I could, for real!\nYou shouldn't let it get you down or blue\nThink, I'm dedicating this song to you\n\n~ChOrUs~", "title": "Change", "album": null}], "artist": "Akwid"}
