Just a thief nobody cares about\nThe kind that would run up in your house steal your jewels and couch\nBeen on the run for so long\nBut they caught me now\nThey hung me on this cross I'm on and I see the crowd\nBut next to me is someone who I've heard about\nThey say He heals the blind and lame but I got my doubts\nSo what's His name I can't remember\nSomeone screamed it out said it was Jesus\nBut this man he didn't make a sound\nHe hung there breathing with the blood running down His mouth\nHe'd been beaten a crown of thorns now was on his brow\nSee what I've done is just the reason why I'm hanging now\nBut this man is innocent and I can see it now\nI said, \"Jesus are you listening do you hear me now\nRemember me just on the day You bring Your kingdom down\nI want to change my ways I really want Your freedom now,\"\nHe took my sin away and this is why I say it loud\n\nI once was lost but then You found me and loved me\nAnd I'm never gonna look away\nNo I'm never gonna look away\nYou paid the cost You showed me how You bought me\nAnd I'm never gonna look away\nNo I'm never gonna look away (away)\n\nHe turned His head and said Today you're gonna be with Me\nCause very soon I'll be dead but I'm a set you free\n\nCause every drop that I've bled is so what you would see\nThat it was shed for you to be with Me eternally\nThe other thief he just laughed at what He said to me\nSee what I think is you're a liar and it's plain to see\nBut Jesus was silent and soon time began to pass\nHe cried \"It is finished\" and went and breathed his last\nHe died in the sky was rumbling and started turning black\nBut I knew He'd come again because I knew the facts\nMy time to die is coming soon and it's coming fast\nIt's hard to breathe I'm trying to began to gasp\nI can't deny what is true cause it's all I have\nNow I knew that paradise is where I'm heading at\n\nI once was lost but then You found me and loved me\nAnd I'm never gonna look away\nNo I'm never gonna look away\nYou paid the cost You showed me how You bought me\nAnd I'm never gonna look away\nNo I'm never gonna look away (away)\n\n(Bridged)\nI had a debt I could not pay\nYour love broke through took it away\nI once was lost now I'm found to You I make this joyful sound\nPlease remember me Lord when You come again\nTime is passing by my life is coming to the end\nI'm about to die it's time so please let me in\nPlease remember me Lord when You come again\n\nI once was lost but then You found me and loved me\nAnd I'm never gonna look away\nNo I'm never gonna look away\nYou paid the cost You showed me how You bought me\nAnd I'm never gonna look away\nNo I'm never gonna look away"}]}
