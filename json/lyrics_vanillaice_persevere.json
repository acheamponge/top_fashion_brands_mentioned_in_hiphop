You will not\nThrow dirt when I'm down, You can not. You will not\nIf you try stop me now. You can not. You will not\nPersevere, What don't kill you makes you stronger\n\n[Chorus]\nPersevere, from trailer to white collar\nPersevere, Let the hate bulid you up\n\nAnd don't give a fuck. I will survive pressures of life\nI won't deny I didn't want this life\nIf problems arise, cut'em down to size, I will survive and immortalize\n\nHard times, you can lose your mind sometimes\nHard times leavin' the crimes to life Enes\nHard times expecting the blind to lead the blind\nHard times look in the mirror and hate what you find\n\nBut why, pick up your brains, walk through the storm\nHard times, really keepin it raw\nFight back mind over matter attack\nDon't slack Program your mind back on track\n\n[Chorus]", "album": "Platinum Underground", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6cb6a5698568a3c6d4ee16b134b1f6ce.640x640x1.jpg"}]}
