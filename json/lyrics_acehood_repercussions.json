You best say it now and we won\u2019t wave it down\nMoving through my haters town, none of them are proud\nI'm on my flyer shit, I'm buttoned up, I leveled up\nI told my girl, be back, I doubled up, I made her blush\nI\u2019m on a half, I'm feeling wired up\nBig body truck, I'm high as fuck, I'm doing like 90 something\nI'm playing ready bout the baby, got my body jumping\nMy Queen with me, she ain't tripping, shit you gotta love it\nSkip the discussions, repercussions, keep that reefer coming\nI smoked an L and told my dawgs \"You know it's all or nothing\"\nKeep adding crunches, every day I'm adding minor touches\nSomebody bluffing, everybody claim they getting money\nYou people funny, all I\u2019m thinking when I\u2019m out in London\nI made it public, independent, you know how I'm coming\nFeel it in your stomach\nPeople talking like he up to something, I\u2019m alpha stomping\nGot it jumping like I'm Kylie Jenner\nSomebody tell 'em shit get crazy when I find a rhythm\nI'm dying to get \u2019em, I been patient, I been handling business\nThem big decisions got me privileged, been on my wildest dreams\nNo hesitation, know I'm coming with no reservations\nJust hella changes for my people, we need reparations\nThem Devil stations, I been healing all my past relations, through conversations\nTreat this music like my testimony, my revelations\nStill I know I'm nowhere near my greatest, working on it (Huh)\n\n[Verse 2: Slim Diesel]\nI got two MAC-11's and went and bought me a K'\nI been fighting the Devil, feel like I'm locked in the cage\nHow you dig with no shovel, rebel you lost in a daze\nAll my niggas is instrumental, we're running the fade\nI got two sticks with a drum kit, what you want, bitch?\nOh shit, you a locksmith, you can get popped quick\nOh Lord, oh no\nI swear to God, I heard you're pussy when I'm in the park\nYou been a fraud\nOnly reason that you ain't split it all, you still a fraud\nHold a [?] a synagogue, I been a God, it's dead\n\n[Outro]\nHood Nation (Body Bag)\nBody Bag (Aye)\nAnd we the motherfuckin' truth, ya heard?
