Na Na Na...\nNa na na... Na Na Na... (Give It To 'Em)\nNa na na... Na Na Na...\nNa na na... Na Na Na... (Just... Give It To 'Em)\nNa na na... Na Na Na...\nNa na na... Na Na Na... (Give It To 'Em)\nNa na na... Na Na Na...\nNa na na... Na Na Na... (Give It To 'Em)\n\n[Verse 1: Akon]\nKnow they kickin' down your door just waving their four-four\nAin't thinking about the law\nOnly thing on they mind, is a little bit of shine\nAnd a couple stacks stashed up in your top drawers (So, Give It To 'Em)\nAnd they coming 'round the corner, 5 percent [?]\nChevy creepin' real slow, you know the routine\nDon't try to play Magiver\nSawed of shotgun pointin' out the window (So, Give It To 'Em)\nNot to mention them crooked cops\nPull you over when you drop\nOn the side of the road, take all your word\nPocket all your dough\nI ain't goin' thru none of that no more\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Rick Ross]\nShell toed Adidas, all black Lamborghini\nSexy thang ridin' with me, granting wishes like a genie\nAin't no problem gettin' money, certified eight digits\nStreet... When it come to gettin' paper better... (Give It To 'Em)\nStarted at poverty now they call us the penticle\nTalkin' Bugatti I blow it all on a vehicle\nMillions in real-estate and the work that I administrate\nWhen I smoke in the whip, peel the top just to vehicles\nAin't no palm trees in the ghetto, yeah it's cloudy weather\nBut we shinin' bright as ever!\nI refuse to lose in any game I choose to play\nUntil I die, I gotta get it in a major way\nAkon saved the day...\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Give It to \u2019Em", "album": "The Return Of Albert Anastasia"}], "artist": "Akon"}
