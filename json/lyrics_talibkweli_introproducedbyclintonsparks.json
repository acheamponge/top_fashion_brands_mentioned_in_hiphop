Talib Kweli! Please, hold your applause until the end. We are GLAD to come and hear you speak. We love it! Kweli doesn't like me to talk about this but one time we were driving through the Mississippi delta and there was a brotha runnin up the side of the road and he didn't have any shoes on. He didn't have a shirt on and I started to drive right by this man. Kweli said \"Stop the car because that brotha might be in trouble\" and I stopped the car. Kweli said to the man he said \"Brotha are you ok do you need a ride somewhere?\" and the man looked at Kweli and said \"Shhhhhh... I'm escapin!\" and Kweli took him by the hand and said \"My brotha you didn't get the memo, we have been free for some time now\" well I'm wisinen up. Please welcome good friend, scholar, ghetto philosopher, three time Nobel peace prize winner, first black man to pilot an aircraft, the nigga that made up the Nike swoosh, the man that made Koolaid say \"oh yeah!\" Brooklyn's own...\nTalib Kweli"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
