No? Good. There he goes\nI guess this is as good a time as any to say that\nJust between you and me, I fucking hate that guy\n\nOh shit. Perhaps I shouldn't have recorded this\nWell, I am off to change my name and address\nJust as soon as I stop having sex\nThere we go\n\nWait, no I started again"}], "artist": "Ninja Sex Party"}
