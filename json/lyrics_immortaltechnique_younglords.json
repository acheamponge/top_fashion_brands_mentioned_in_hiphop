We are a colony, we are fighting for freedom\nBecause we will not be a slave nation por favor\nThe struggle here is to make universities\nThe struggle here is in the community\nIt's against the police and violence\nIt's against discrimination\nIt's against the crime against humanity on this beautiful Caribbean Island. This is Panama\nYoung lords, revolutionary always, from San Juan, Puerto Rico\nQue viva Puerto Rico libre!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d17ee30cab427a6ea7fa3bfa64561580.400x400x1.jpg", "album": "The Martyr", "year": "2011-10-27"}]}
