The clock strike ten\nI guarantee none of y'all be on the block like him\nCock the fifth back you get baffled, click clack, you skedaddle\nLot of niggas bust they guns, but not like them\nThe record labels are scared of me, Internet gotta bag me\nFirst they said I was gangsta, then they said 'not exactly'\nI rap about politicians, I rap about Pataki\nThe loser maneuvers of Edgar Hoover reenacted\nBeing I'm on my black shit, they be trying silence me\nBut to do that shit, they'll have to do it violently\nClack clack that mack back\nRat-at-at-at-at\nA lot of niggas bust they guns, but not like them\n\n[Verse 2: Styles P]\nA lot of niggas bust they guns, but not like them\nY'all niggas is lukewarm, y'all ain't hot like them\nThem motherfuckers my brothers, they are not my friends\nWe the band with the bond, from grams on the arm\nA lot of niggas bust they guns, but not like them\nY'all niggas is lukewarm, y'all ain't hot like them\nThem motherfuckers my brothers, they are not my friends\nWe the band with the bond, from grams on the arm\nThe uncut dope, ya had to land on the farm\nRapping on arenas, rubberbands to the mobs\nGetting high to Sinatra, in the sands of the palms\nReminiscing on rapping with BIG, the man was a don\nNiggas did it big, but not like them\nDrink champange in the ocean just to drown my sins\nShit I pray when valet, pull around my Benz\nThese niggas know my beginning, but not my end\nYeah\nIt's me and Saigon and the paesans\nNetwork behind us like we Verizon\nGo ahead and chill out, get your vibe on\nCause this could be the day that you died on", "album": "The Greatest Story Never Told 2: Bread And Circuses"}], "artist": "Saigon"}
