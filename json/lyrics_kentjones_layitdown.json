Oh I think I know yo' type though\nI'm stereotypin' like a keyboard on a speaker\nI never professed love unless I love a teacher\nThat was in college, I always liked 'em older\nI guess that's why I fell in love with Queen Latifah\nI like what I see in you\nThey tell you that you bein' mean, I say that you bein' you\nComin' from the same city where they ain't no bein' true\nIt could be discouragin' to a flower that's flourishin'\nGotta be full of yourself due to an ego that nobody's nourishin'\nIf we take a break we might hit a curb again\nAnd take the risk of gettin' hurt again\nIf not this time it might not work again\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nI'll cook your dinner\nI'll even take out the trash\nWhen your mind is cluttered\nI throw it all in my bag\nBaby, better yet I'll be your dumpster\nWhenever you call my number\nLay it down on me\n\n[Hook]\nYeah I want you to lay it down on me\nLay it down on me, lay it down on me\nI want you to lay it down on me\nLay it down on me, lay it down on me\n\n[Post-Hook]\nNow baby I'll be your dumpster\nWhenever you dial my number\nLay it down on me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI love the girl that I was fuckin' over\nI hate the girl that I was over-fuckin'\n'Cause now it's nothin' but an old discussion\nAlmost forgot about it, so it wasn't\nI'm way too focused on openin' new doors to get the heat out like an open oven\nIt's okay to toot your own horn if it's no 'percussion\nBut I ain't marchin' with a wedding band\nShe the type to meet a new nigga with a wedding plan\nYour mind is cluttered, I would swoop you off your feet\nBut I got feelings on the shelf, and I hardly keep it neat\nBut I always think fun, so there's a party every week\nAnd that's where I throw it\nI sit on my watches, I'm on my own time\nAnd you're never at the party 'cause you're never on my mind\nI guess some things get better over time\nBut no more time mean to play your time's out\nI don't wanna wait or stay to find out\nFuck this chat, I'm leavin' the room, I'm signed out\nThen I ate her inside right after we dined out\nEvery time she comes, I arrive\nMy dick swings like it comes with monkey bars and a slide\nAnd she slept over 'til the next mornin'\nThe other cried on my shoulder had the next mournin'\nLast night was a movie so I kept scorin'\nNow she's addicted guess my \"no\" was the best warnin'\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nI'll cook your dinner\nI'll even take out the trash\nWhen your mind is cluttered\nI throw it all in my bag\nBaby, better yet I'll be your dumpster\nWhenever you call my number\nLay it down on me\n\n[Hook]\nYeah I want you to lay it down on me\nLay it down on me, lay it down on me\nI want you to lay it down on me\nLay it down on me, lay it down on me\n\n[Post-Hook]\nNow baby I'll be your dumpster\nWhenever you dial my number\nLay it down on me"}], "artist": "Kent Jones"}
