{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Aesop Rock] *acapella*\nJiggy-jabberjaw vitamin idol and primal rages\nWhen bible page verse tidal waves begun (Water won)\nI wrote the book that shook America to splinters\nIn a winter wasteland icicle-bound barren township\nCall Baron M\u00fcnchhausen and proud gimps to clinch this chemical war pig\nDelinquent sinking like a paper tugboat well beneath your holidays\nBeached on a red tide infested shore corroding eastern seaboard beauty\nI'm a jigsaw slab, but all the pig saw was dirt bag\n\nIt's like a bleeding comet bombing on your sequels\nTo the Riverside Park Tunnel people claim last lifeform standing\nCarbon based pardons ain't enough\nMy stilts truly personify this urbanite flea circus\nWe urchins merkin on daily\nI catapult brain opera past basic\nTear my own face off in the finale, stick around it's ill\nDiabolic Prodigal Son spill grimmace\nIf you had one more eye, you'd be a Cyclops\nWhich explains missing the premise\nBliss mimic, baptise, chastise, laugh, die\nKiss the finish, piss the villagers the fuck off\nPete Piper picked peppers, and Run rocked rhymes\nAes Rock might've smoked one too many dimes in his time\nNow, where you gonna be when the sun falls, brother?\nProbably gathering your sheep with all these other motherfuckers\nStruck twice in the same place by a moody Zeus fishliner\nSmackin the third clear out the park\nGoing gone (To infinity and beyond!)\nI rocked for a flock of Chewbacca look-alikes in magic makers\nHermit crabs and New York city sewer aligators\nKeep your Honalee dreams out your homily\nI deal with tangible goods\nAnd avoid manufacturing food for landfills\nI've seen friends bow to needles\nI've seen needles bow to records\nI've seen boughs break\nI've seen God bow and make the clouds shake\nI've seen the proud break\nI've seen a lot for a blind soldier\nWho tattooed a cityscape on skin to blend in\nThe rats travel by night and fight the waterbugs\nI'm here to pull the three-prong on this prime directive wormhole of self-sacrifice\nAdd a hatchet slice for kicks\nAnd so that God-awful Frankenstein scar on your style can someday be a story for my kids\nLife's hard, life's easy\nLife's everyting in between\nLife's Peachy like James and the Giant\nAnd I keep spittin as long as these kittens buy it\nAnd I keep casting my line as long as these fish will bite it\nAnd I like it (Don't try it like that)\n\n[Movie sample]\n\"Yes the bough is low\nThat's the way it goes though....\nMaybe I should just give up or stop trying\nBut life is so uncertain, so short\nI've got to keep on searching\nAnd wherever it takes me, I've got to go\"\n\n[Aesop Rock]\nBantamweight temper tantrum, decrepit anthem\nSet a low goal, I arrive late\nI'm here to scrape a cog clean till the funk machine\nImposes on the underling amalgam cluster and identifies the mother\n(Oh you got heart?)\nI hate to tell you but it skips more than it palpitates\nLike these here drunken little archers miss more than they calculate\nThe falcon hates the mockingbird\nThe farmer hates the drought\nI hate em all, I kick the bottom brick out shouting \"Yes y'all\"\nAnd blow the village out perspective (Aesop!)\nDo you take this makeshift Candy Land cult-classic bastard style\nTo be your lawfully wedded head trip\nTo embrace throughout sickness, health, electrical storm\nFire, pain, rain, hail, wind, ice, sleet, snow? (Hell no!)\nI'm balanced, personified phantom to the bone\nWalkin like a Jabberwocky\nScalpin a pair of one-way tickets to shadowboxing\nIt\u2019s just like Christmas with a shallow stocking\nLike this (I'm just trying to milk the mileage)\nYou drop science like Don Herbert with liquor in him\nSoundin' off like senior citizens sitting at Bingo parlor bickering\nYeah, it's kinda funny, isn't it?\nHow I can build while you just sit there and bitch about your syllabus\n\n[Hook] 4x\nDwarfed by the lights, bewildered by the fanbase\nBound by an idea, skeptical of the handshakes\n\nSkeptical of the handshakes {*repeat to fade*}", "title": "The Yes and the Y\u2019all", "album": "Labor Days", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6a16cbbd76c264fec96a9675981e9556.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2001-09-18"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
