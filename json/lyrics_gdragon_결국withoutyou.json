fallin\u2019 without you\n\n\nEnglish (Translated)\n\n[Verse 1: G-Dragon]\nLove is painful, although love is painful\nI repeat it like a fool, that\u2019s what I always do\nBut pain is beautiful, It\u2019s same as you\nHope turns into disappointment\nHope turns into despair\nThe deeper love grows, the deeper the pain gets\nI make the mistake of thinking\nAnd hoping it\u2019ll be different this time\n\n[Verse 2: G-Dragon]\nIn the end, how many years would have passed?\nThere is no such thing as forever\nIn the end, were we never meant to be?\nI am alone again\nBarely, barely, barely\nI thought I only barely found true love\nBut in the end, in the end, it ends like this\n\n[Chorus: G-Dragon]\nMy heart is just like the first time\nBut now it\u2019s filled with scars because of you\nWe keep changing, at your cold voice\nI cool down too\nWe grown so far apart to turn things back\nTo linger around each other without any feelings\nIt was so hard that I gifted you with separation\nAnd after turning around, I\u2019m fallin\u2019 without you\n\n[Verse 3: Ros\u00e9]\nIn the end, whose fault was it?\nThere is no such thing as love\nIn the end, is breaking up, losing?\nI\u2019m tired and I fall asleep\nBarely, barely, barely\nIs this point barely our last?\nIn the end, in the end, are we becoming strangers again?\n\n[Chorus: G-Dragon]\nMy heart is just like the first time\nBut now it\u2019s filled with scars because of you\nWe keep changing, at your cold voice\nI cool down too\nWe grown so far apart to turn things back\nTo linger around each other without any feelings\nIt was so hard that I gifted you with separation\nAnd after turning around, I\u2019m fallin\u2019 without you\n\n[Bridge: G-Dragon]\nYeah I\u2019m fallin\u2019 without you hey\n\n[Verse 4: G-Dragon & Ros\u00e9]\nLet\u2019s go\nI didn\u2019t know at first, I liked her empty spot\nBut after a day or two, I would appreciate her\nI didn\u2019t know about myself\nI thought I could live well without you\nTomorrow will be different from today\nIt\u2019s already been 1, 2 years\nAs much as the hardships of those times\nMy lingering attachments increase\nI pray that things will change as time passes\nFor you my baby\n\n[Chorus: G-Dragon]\nMy heart is just like the first time\nBut now it\u2019s filled with scars because of you\nWe keep changing, at your cold voice\nI cool down too\nWe grown so far apart to turn things back\nTo linger around each other without any feelings\nIt was so hard that I gifted you with separation\nAnd after turning around, I\u2019m fallin\u2019 without you\n\n[Outro: G-Dragon]\nYeah I\u2019m fallin\u2019 without you"}]}
