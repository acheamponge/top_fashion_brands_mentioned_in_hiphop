One day you have it and then\nPoof! It's gone with the wind\nIt's akin to the end\nAnd no matter how you fight it\nHow you light it, how you write it\nTime is the pen out of ink\nPoof! And I'm a living proof\nI used to have it all young and uncoof\nThese days, I hear on everything on delay\nCause I wear an earpiece just to hear what he say\nWhen my son visit, I don't know why I get livid\nMaybe I'm jealous of his age, my memory's vivid\nI was just like him, young like him\nHad a mouth on me a tongue like him\nBut now, I'm feeling much weaker\nClosest thing to my heart is a monitoring beeper\nAnd my eyes ain't what they used to be either\nBut here's me singing promise from la Vita\n\n[Hook]\nWhen I am old and lonely\nWould you still be there for me?\nCause now I have all of my strength\nAnd you have all your beauty\nWhen you're gold in Timbuktu\nWould I still come look for you?\nLet's swim in the deep end\nMake it one big weekend\nFor you, for me\nBuried in the deep end\nLife is one big weekend\n\n[Verse 2]\nPush! One day you come and then\nWhoosh! You'd be surprised how easy it is\nTo be enticed and feasting life\nWithout the least of dreams suffice\nSo watch it fly like feats of height\nSo I'm busy chasing a decent size\nTush! and I ain't never been a wuss\nHave more arms than an octopus\nThose days I never thought of old age\nI never thought I'd see the hair in my nose gray\nBut life goes on, how ironic\nIf I could do it over, I'd probably smoke chronic\nBut still follow the footsteps of prophet Muhammed\nI'd probably turn every lie that I told honest\nI'd be an eco-terrorist\nI'd give the middle finger to my therapist\nAnd flush my sedatives\nI'll have a baby with a feminist and name him sexist\nLife's a contradiction on my check list\n\n[Hook]\nWhen I am old and lonely\nWould you still be there for me?\nCause now I have all of my strength\nAnd you have all your beauty\nWhen you're gold in Timbuktu\nWould I still come look for you?\nLet's swim in the deep end\nMake it one big weekend\nFor you, for me\nBuried in the deep end\nLife is one big weekend"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
