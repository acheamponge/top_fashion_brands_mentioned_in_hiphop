And we playin' Super Nintendo\nI hear this lady: 'Yo, I heard you been looking for me, nigga'\nThen she just -- boom-boom-boom-boom-boom!\nShe let off about eight shots. Then I heard the other gun fire off\nAnd we were just still there playing there, like nothin' happened\nAnd then Vietnam, them people came back crazy. I (live) in Vietnam\nSo what you think I'mma be if I live in it and they just went and visited?\"\n\n[Saigon]\nSuckers could not survive what I philosophize\nWhen somebody dies, you see why I'm not surprised?\nHad a plot to rise since I looked in the doctor's eyes\nSince I started drinkin milk that was homogenized\nI would strive with or without a pops to provide\nMoms still cries cause she fell for a crock of lies\nI try to teach her to fight her fears\nI try to teach her to wipe her tears\nDon't worry, shit gon' be aight this year\nI'm at the top of my game, just watch for my name\nBetter off poppin my brain than poppin my chain (dang!)\nI claim king without droppin a thing\nWhen they ask if I'm the best, I reminisce of the bing and think...\n\n[LeAlan Jones]\nWhen I was ten, I seen my first automatic weapon\nA Glock Nine -- two clips\n\n[Lloyd Newman]\nI seen all kinds of guns -- .44, .22, (Techs!) Techs. I saw rifles\n\n[Jones:] Mac 10, Mac 11\n[Newman:] Living around here. You hear shooting all the time\n\n[Saigon]\nDamn..\nThe drama's pitiful, lil' niggas is homicid-ical\nCouple meals ago, shorty was eatin through his umbilical\nNow he feel he unkillable, shit is all amazing\nThe wrong altercation'll leave his ass with a long abrasion\nI try to make my life the focal through rhymes\nThese niggas do vocal booth crimes, I shot niggas multiple times\nYou sold a few dimes, but when you rapping, you the crack king\nI sold it to whites when you thought it was just a black thing\nI'm filled with this realness, rappers happen to lack it\nI'm flabbergasted you got a platinum plaque for that wack shit\nAll the real gangstas, they on their way to bein dead or in jail\nThey don't make records to sell\n\n[Lloyd Newman]\nI asked my father, Chill, what his best memories of my mother are\n\n['Chill']\nMe and her have fun, putting our feet in the water together\nWe were sober then... but once we started gettin high..\nThem memories gone... They gone\n\n[Newman:] Why are you drinking?\n[Chill:] I don't understand why I'm drinking\n[Newman:] Do you think you're gonna stop?\n[Chill:] Yeah, I'm going to rehab, and take care of myself\n[Newman:] What do you drink?\n[Chill:] I drink about two or three pints of wine a day\nBut it ain't helping me, ain't doin nothin' but killing me\nDon't people understand it's destroying you?\n[Newman:] If it's destroying you, why do you still drink?\nDo you think you've been a good father?\n[Chill:] Yes, I have, to the best capability I could\n[Newman:] I have no further questions\n\n[Saigon]\nThe drama's pitiful, lil' niggas is homicid-ical\nCouple meals ago, shorty was eatin through his umbilical\nNow he feels he unkillable, shit is all amazing\nThe wrong altercation'll leave his ass with a long abrasion\nI try to make my life the focal through rhymes\nThese niggas do vocal booth crimes, I shot niggas multiple times\nYou sold a few dimes, but when you rapping, you the crack king\nI sold it to whites when you thought it was just a black thing\nI'm filled with this realness, rappers happen to lack it\nI'm flabbergasted you got a platinum plaque for that wack shit\nAll the real gangstas, they on their way to bein dead or in jail\nThey don't make records to sell\nThey don't make records to sell\nThey don't make records to sell\nThey don't make records to sell\nThey don't make records to sell\nThey don't make records to sell\n\n[Saigon]\nUhhm, mmmm! What time is it, man?\nMan, it's about 7 o'clock, hmmm!\nGone back to sleep, man", "album": "The Greatest Story Never Told"}], "artist": "Saigon"}
