(Ain't shit you can do)\nAin't nothin stoppin me from killin you!\nYou, you can't, you can't hurt me now! (Ain't shit you can do)\nAin't nothin stoppin me from killin you!\n\n[Verse 2: Blaze]\nI ate a pack of firecrackers (Did it Mix)\nWhen I piss, sparks shoot straight outta my dick\nGet the picture before I stab you with the knife\nBut you can't take somethin that I don't have nothin of, right?\nThat's right, I'm more than a ghost\nI still slang ki's on the corner by the light post\nI can't walk the walk\nBut I stray scarin more ho ho's than santa claus\nI been electrocuted, it ain't do shit\nExcept fucked a bare hands outta tiny [?]\nI get ran down then I get back up\nPissin down like a crackhead, curled up\nMy eyes swelled up and I can't see straight\nThen I dive off the overpass on to the interstate\nWho you lookin at and what'chu gonna do?\nYou can try to kill me, I'mma sho' gon kill you\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Interlude: Anybody Killa]\nYo, this is Anybody mothafuckin' Killa! This crew don't feel pain!\nWe Psychopathic! Especially my dead homie Blaze!\nTell me, how the hell a dead mothafucka gonna die!!!?!??!\n\n[Verse 3: Blaze]\nI drink liquid scar, cuz I like the taste\nAnd thug on police till they mace my face\nWent to the White House, pissed on the grass\nStep to the President's wife to get some ass\nEat Halloween candy, blades in the center\n\"Man how you be so mean?\" , I can't remember\nMy throat got cut but I sewed it back\nRap like (*incoherent rapping*), and it's still phat\nThis mothafucka tried to stab me in my love handle\nSo I blew his lights out like a fuckin candle\nIf you shoot me, you better bring a cannon\nIn the end, I'mma be the last G standin\nCan you imagine bleedin everyday\nWrappin up wounds with rooms of duct tape\nWho you lookin' and what'chu gonna do?\nYou can try to kill me, I'mma sho' gone kill you\n\n[Hook x2]\n\nPsychopathic!!"}], "artist": "Blaze Ya Dead Homie"}
