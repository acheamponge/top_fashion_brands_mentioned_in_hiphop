So conceited\nHit me on my beeper\nYou back in the Days Inn, I am on my leave\n2000, I'm wiling, I'm styling\nThe boy bout to blow up, money bout to start piling\nThat girl is Italian\nY'all don't wanna know the outcome\nThe game you playing, I'm dealing with the lames, and\n\nI'm wild, I need taming\nYou niggas better d-d-duck when I'm aiming\n\nWith a ? status fitted on my hair\nAnd motherfucker I'm ill\n\nHold up, wait, all you niggas get back\nRehab flow: all a nigga do it ?\nDropped out of high school to get every dollar\nGet it? GED: a real Rhodes Scholar\nDrinking Milk of Magnesia cause I refuse to see a doctor:\nThat's sick, and Casey V asked me to murder this shit\nDVR flow, you should pause and rewind me\nClown ass rappers over here trying to mine me\nBut this beat over his head just like\nDiddy did Steve Stoute\n\nYou average rappers killing me, I mean really offending me\nTalking about shit an average rapper hasn't really seen, like\n\nI'm sort of like a journalist, writing what I see\n\nLiterally: yes, the article is all on me\n\nI practice what I preach like I'm some sort of preacher\n\nI'll have your ass on murk like sour lemon diesel\n\nCotton mouth, slavery, weed ?\n\nStreet cred like Big, me doing it big\n\nArrogant Veggies, you can't test: rude boy"}]}
