We bet it all on hopeless?\nAnd swim against the tide 'til until our every bone is broken\nA sinking ship is still a ship, no captain has spoke the obit\n'Til the crew is flew, crow's nest slips silent beneath the ocean\nWe set sail without an anchor, we count upon that never stop\nAn anchor's just a coffin nail, waiting for that hammer drop\nIt holds you by the ankles 'til it pulls you to the Acheron\nTrade stable to be able to slip out from under devil's thumb\nKeep your anchor, my home is where my hat is hung\nPostcard-printed paper, and love notes from the lattice rungs\nBlessed are the vagrant, the lonely are the static ones\nIt's every drifter's confirmation this world is just ravishing\n\n[Hook]\nI know it seems like we're all lost, we can follow this river back home\nRiver back home\nRiver back home\nI know it seems like we're all lost, we see the secrets, we know the unknown\nKnow the unknown\nKnow the unknown\nKeep close, hold my hand now, just be strong\nWe can follow this river right back to your home\nBack to your home\nBack to your home\nI know it seems like we're all lost, we see the secrets, we know the unknown\nKnow the unknown\nKnow the unknown", "year": "2011-09-13"}]}
