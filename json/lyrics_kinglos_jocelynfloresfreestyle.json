Can you hug him? I know he miss me lil bro\nHe died when I was 16, & he got killed in a whip\nSome pussy ass nigga robbed him, I still be feeling that shit\nIt made me empty inside, but I know life is a blessing, so I was out\nSaving lives, as I was fighting depression\nNO MORE KINGS KILLING KINGS\nWe have to make the exception, nigga I look just like you\nHow could you hate your reflection?\nI felt neglected myself, but still respected myself\nThe times that I felt lonely, I used to connect with myself\nI know your pain like it's mine, I feel the void that's inside\n\nHOW NIGGAS AIN\u2019T THERE FOR YOUR HIGHLIGHTS, BUT RECORD YOUR DEMISE?!\n\nD a m n\""}]}
