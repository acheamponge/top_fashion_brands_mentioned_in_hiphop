Its also a pronoun\nBought the deed to some land in a southpole snowtown\n\n[Verse 2: Moka Only]\nFool me once, shame on you\nFool me twice, im lame..cats is nice with the game\nIn this record lane...NOT!\nStill i manage to get strung along once i brung a song\nTo the tabletop and had it flop\nWasn't for the lack of opportunity knocking\nJust a lot of empty promises and halfhearted talking\nEven paperwork dont seem to hold a lotta water\nNever seeing sales reports\nOr reports of my slaughter in retail land\nIve tried to expand\nDone a lot for the cause but the rebel gets slammed doors\nNever opening after initial work\nPromoters holdin out on the dough\nI\u2019m thinkin this will work\nEverytime I sign on the line\nAt least try to flex optimism\nAnd see the shine I get idle text\nOne of these days I may really wake up\nBut for now they keep foolin til my band break up and thats tough\n\n[Verse3: Billy Woods]\nI booked the same room as our first date/relieved\nFinally no need to lie about working late/nervously pace\nLooking in the mirror/you look great\nEasily ten years younger\nI could be thirty-eight\nPetals on the duvet I picture her face\nAfter years of roses on nightstands\nWhen I take her hand\nAnd say you could be an honest woman\nI\u2019ll be your man\nOne finger to her lips [shhhhh]\nDon\u2019t say a word yet/champagne on ice ill take you away\nFrom all of this/you don\u2019t have to put on the red light\nA single passionate kiss\nThat shows me you had the same knot in your chest\nFrom years of wondering \u201cmaybe\u201d and \u201cwhat if\u201d\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love my wife and kids but this is it\nFor happiness I\u2019m waiting by the window like Malcolm X\nCourtyard by Marriott/Room twenty-six\n\n[Verse 4: Elucid]\nJust as real as i imagined\nHoneysuckle root all on my mattress\nI want u forever if u asking\nInfatuated visions in this blackness\nMatchstick memory\nCandlelight/Shadowplay\nUnfamiliar Energy/Welcoming\nA fortnight since we last connected\nConfessions\nOtherworldly pleasures in your presence\nPossess me/these sessions in succession\nBy the moon exhausted\nDrain me baby awesome\nClimax cumulus\nUnion of like mind\nSidetracked illusions\nIm not truly in right mind\nDemon spawn polluted\nIm consumed/a fool in denial\nNight time intrusions\nConcluded with deceitful smiles/waking hours\nEyes open on cold tile covered in sweat and bile\nDoc shake his head look over my files\nLong time sufferer asylum\nSilence awaiting her arrival"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
