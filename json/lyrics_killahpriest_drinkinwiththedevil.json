What? Where's Sheila?\nAhhh, now I remember, I had beef wit this mothafucka\nWhere he at \"Who sir?\"\nThe mothafucka who brought me out here\nNigga was standin' right here\n\"Sir I don't know what you're talkin' about, but we about to close\"\nSo I staggered to the couch and hit the door\nIt's cool, you mothafucka \"Get home safe sir\"\nI feel bad, but I'mma get you"}]}
