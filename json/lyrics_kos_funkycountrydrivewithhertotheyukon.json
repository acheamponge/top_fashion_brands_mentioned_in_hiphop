Because they want a piece of the pie\n\nMy abilita familifa, a quicker mind\n'Cause I need to proceed, deep with a Godspeed\nEnvy, whack emcees, get the gong\nK-dub lookin' above with new songs\n\nI've been tryin' to learn this new song\nBut I hear the same ol' music every day\nHey, hey, hey\nGonna fly with her to the Yukon\nGonna melt my soul on ice, then get away\nHey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey\n\nI don't wanna know how we came to be\nAll that I've been shown is there's only you and me\nHelp me figure out where this all went wrong\nI think we need a new song, a new song\n\nWord up, you know what I mean\nSometimes I, I just, it's music, it's music, we love music\nHuh, to the, to the, to the, uhh, to the, to the, to the\nTo the, to the, to the"}], "artist": "\u200bk-os"}
