I say fuck that\nWe war and buck back with the cannon or knife\nCause Vinnie Paz ain\u2019t have a problem with Iran in his life\nAnd I ain\u2019t got a problem stabbing up your man with a spike\nBut I got a problem murdering a man and his wife\nFor some land that I ain\u2019t never even stand in my life\nFor a man who couldn\u2019t tell you what abandonment\u2019s like\nBeen scammed all my life from Reaganomics to the crack war\nAnd y\u2019all are wondering what we run around with gats for\nAll I ask for is a good night\u2019s sleep\nSo I pray to Allah hoping that the hood might eat\nEach one teaches ones but the hood like beef\nBut I\u2019m a hypocrite daddy so I pull my heat\n\n[Hook: Sabac]\n\nWe fighting a war in the jungle of the ghetto\nYour life will be gone once we hurt you with the metal\nWe blast at the system, bang for the streets\nUrban gorillas mutherfuckers hanging the beast\n\nWe fighting a war in the jungle of the ghetto\nYour life will be gone once we hurt you with the metal\nWe blast at the system, bang for the streets\nUrban gorillas mutherfuckers hanging the beast\n\n[Verse 2: Sabac]\n\nWe urban gorillas on the move like John Africa\nWe the masses that practice tactics right out of Attica\nWe blast at you, catch you for hostage, torture demons\nFor all the bleeding we must have war before freedom\nY\u2019all fiending and loathing hopes to reach an atonement\nWe\u2019ll have peace in a moment after we beat our opponents\nWe jonesing like Jonestown Massacre, the White Knight\nForcing suicides spike your soft drinks with cyanide\nCall it payback for what you made and inflicted\nWe live in a world being lead by racists and bigots\nWe stripped the land from the natives and chose to call them Americans\nThen claimed it as ours as if they forfeit inheritance\nIt\u2019s evident intelligence and weapons become medicine\nWe\u2019ll overthrow the devils in power and move ahead of them\nWe veterans from poverty, we rocking the streets\nFreedom and equality come when we conquer the beast\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Q-Unique]\n\nWith the right to bear arms I\u2019m excited to throw one\nQ the urban gorilla, Brooklyn\u2019s Mighty Joe Young\nThat faces the firing squad that\u2019ll spit on three\nScreaming till my death, \u201cKing Kong ain\u2019t got shit on me.\u201d\nI beat on my chest with the game of a Silverback\nI don\u2019t fire warning shots, take aim with a killer gat\nThem peace talks and rallies will get so far\nFight the most powerful imperialists in the name of Elizam Escobar\nGuerrilla warfare training camps in the projects\n? climb the staircase till your heart rate progress\nI spit possessed by the soul of Albizu\nLead rips through your chest till the welfare let go of my people\nI was raised in the Bronx, Congo jungle\nWhere the Ball Busters and Zulus locked in a mondo rumble\nAnd you could lose your gold over a Bronco fumble\nAnd the CIA faggots interrogate your sidekick until your Tonto crumbles\n\n[Hook]", "album": "Sabacolypse: A Change Gon\u2019 Come"}], "artist": "Sabac"}
