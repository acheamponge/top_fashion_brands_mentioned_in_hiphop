It is used as a sleep aid, and can also be used for anxiety. The recreational uses for the drug are similar to the prescribed uses. People rely on Alprazolam to help with their sleep or anxiety, and it can also be used to produce a euphoric-like feeling\n\n[Verse 2]\nNiggas run one drill and start to low-key, high-key feel theyself\nMade her set her nigga up, I'm beginning to fear myself\nSmoke a blunt, pop a Xan, take a tab, that's here and there\nThese niggas talkin' Backwoods, don't tell me y'all not hearin' it\nActin like a hood rat, like my t-shirt is not Japanese\nShe said \"Put me on Tay-K,\" and I said put you on yo' knees (get on yo' knees)\nHood lil' bitch, love that, man, I really can't believe\nI'm like maybe it's the Xanax, but maybe it's Maybelline\nI remember all the connects I had on my HTC (my HTC)\nAll them fuck ass niggas hatin' me\nWhile I'm thinkin' 'bout making it (I'm tryna make it)"}], "artist": "Tay-K"}
