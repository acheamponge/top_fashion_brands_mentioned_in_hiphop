I don't trust you\nAutomatics with the mothafuckin grip on it\nOnly do the Glock 40 if the stick on it\nI got trust issues\nI don't trust you. Not at all\n\n\n[Verse 1:Larry June]\n\nI'm paranoid. Trippin. They done took my trap phone\nBig MAC-10 with the shoe lace on it\nIn the scrape thang with my young niggas blowin\nPunk bitch shut up and go get it like I told you\nHow you flippin packs, but you livin with yo momma?\nI bought my bitch Chanel cuz she kept that shit one hunnid\nThe money keep comin. I ain't trippin. Bitch run it\nYeah it's just a t-shirt, but I spent eleven hunnid\nNigga fuck a show. I don't wanna go. I talk dollar signs\nAye Miss Choosey Susie you've been late to calls. There's gon be fine\nI might never answer, but I'll text you back. Don't be greedy now\nWhen I touch a million, I might calm it down, but I highly doubt it\n\n\n[Hook:Larry June]\n\nAutomatics with the mothafuckin grip on it\nOnly do the Glock 40 if the stick on it\nI got trust issues\nI don't trust you. I don't trust you\nAutomatics with the mothafuckin grip on it\nOnly do the Glock 40 if the stick on it\nI got trust issues\nI don't trust you. Not at all\n\n\n[Verse 2:Larry June]\n\nI ain't hangin in no studio. I rather chill with bitches\nCount a hundred thousand dollars. Bitch I'm really bout my business\nLike a bad black bitch, man my 40 got extensions\nHangin at the car lot like \"decisions, decisions.\"\nGot my bitches eating healthy. It's a nice day to mob\nI just knocked a model bitch, but I'm not gon talk about it\nSippin liquor got a nigga wildin\n???? got a nigga noddin\nSit her down and give the bitch some knowledge\nBoss nigga. Never been to college\nBut I really came from the bottom\nUsed to roll with niggas movin Miley Cyrus\nFinessed the whole fuckin rap game\nFuck the rap game. Bitch I need the gualla\nTote a automatic. Thirty round magulator\nNigga have it. Aye! Aye!\nI don't need a codefendant\nDo it by myself\nLet the 40 spray, spray, spray\n\n\n[Hook:Larry June]\n\nAutomatics with the mothafuckin grip on it\nOnly do the Glock 40 if the stick on it\nI got trust issues\nI don't trust you. I don't trust you\nAutomatics with the mothafuckin grip on it\nOnly do the Glock 40 if the stick on it\nI got trust issues\nI don't trust you. Not at all"}], "artist": "Larry June"}
