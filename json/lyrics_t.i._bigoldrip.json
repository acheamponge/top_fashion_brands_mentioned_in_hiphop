Come on\n\n[Chorus: Watch the Duck]\nYou don't know the risk if you ain't carried the weight\nIf you ain't never been down the road that wasn't already paved\nSome shit I don't remember, and some I'll never forget\nAin't nobody give me nothin', ain't nobody tell me shit\nBig ol' drip\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nDangerous lifestyle from jumpin' the turnstile\nRefused to pipe down, the shit we would burn down\nDistress is everywhere, some shit you just gotta turn down\nAnd ain't no freebies in this shit, you get what you earned now\nYeah, you live and you learn but you reap what you sew\nAnd your intention ain't what you'll be held accountable for\nIt's your actions, it don't matter what you do for yourself\nIf every time somebody call on you and you ain't no help\nThat ain't no king shit\nAll that stuff you buyin', it don't mean shit\nOn some boost your self-esteem shit 'cause you ain't seen shit\nCallin' me an activist, stumbled on it by accident\nYou can see I'm passionate but not a politician though\nOn IG I'm killin' that fashion shit, I be drippin' with\nRaf Simons trench coat, cashmere turtleneck\nHow did I get three piece pinstripe with the collar bar\nRose gold cuff link, same as the Audemar?\n\n[Break: T.I.]\nHey, back against the wall, would you risk it all?\nI figure if I could get me some, I could get it all\nStarted with a bankroll small as a tennis ball\nNow in my city I'm big as Pac and Biggie Smalls\nGod with me, whom shall I fear\nThere no more beggin' folk for shit we oughta get ourselves, and\nJust so I'm clear, what it took to get here, you got no idea\nFor real\n\n[Chorus: Watch the Duck]\nYou don't know the risk if you ain't carried the weight\nIf you ain't never been down the road that wasn't already paved\nSome shit I don't remember, and some I'll never forget\nAin't nobody give me nothin', ain't nobody tell me shit\nBig ol' drip"}], "artist": "T.I."}
