Get them sounds up Action\nAlright L.G. baby make the track move one time\n\"You know daddy's home..\"\nUh-huh, now dig this here right\nNow I can remember one time I said\n\"It's eighty-eight, time to set em straight right?\" (word up)\nWhat we gotta do is see what we got in store for ninety-four\nAs I continue to give you more\n\"You know daddy's home..\"\nThis is how we gonna try to bring it to you one time\nUhh, and I go, and I go\n\"You know daddy's home..\"\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nPeace peace y'all, don't eat grease y'all, huh\nA Brooklyn nigga representin the East y'all, come follow me now\nI get down for my crown with new found wreck\nAnd bring the noise like I'm comin to soundcheck\nThe stage is clear for me to rock it\nSo I snatch the mic like a Brooklyn nigga does a pocket\nClear the throat, to perform the art\nTo treat the stage like a movie ticket and rip it apart\nWatch the crowd burst from lyrics that I say\nTo make the brothers get ill, and by the way Dukes\nIf that's your girl in the corner stay up on her\nCause I've been watchin her more, then a Korean store owner\n(Whoo!) Mack man number one, you know how I move\nYou'd think that I'd be shavin my rhymes, cause they'd be so smooth\nMr. Wonderful and all of that gun to pull shit\nThat you be talkin nigga don't even run the bull\nCause if I roll on you kid, I do the body rude\nLike the cops did on ummmmmm.. that Rodney dude\nPeep it!\n\nChorus: repeat 4X (except last line 4th time)\n\n\"welcome to a new Terrordome\nWhen I come to roam you know daddy's home..\"\nWatch out now!\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nJust like Sylvester it's still on, get it?\nStill, on, fukkit, let's move along\nI rip shop, in hip-hop, to sew it like a ziplock\nTo get props, in this spot, look at me at the tip-top\nThe kid got, to get hot, you thought that I would flip-flop\nOr drop-drop, but ummmmmmmmmmmm.. I did not!\nThey say, \"Kane you're old school out here!\"\nI said, \"I guess I got left back, cause I ain't goin nowhere\"\nThe Kane will remain in this domain\nTo reign again when I entertain\nCause when it comes to lyrics, I got plenty black\nI'm so god damn dope, I sell rhymes in a twenty sack\nThe microphone pusher man but not drug related\nHip-Hop orientated, keepin you captivated\nMr. Cee cuts, I linger through em, Larry is singin to em\nAnd oh me, I just bring it to em\n\nChorus *fades out*", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c57181cdaaeb4f7bcf3a5a0f89a83315.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "1994-09-13", "title": "Daddy\u2019s Home", "album": "Daddy\u2019s Home"}]}
