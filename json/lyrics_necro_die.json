A couple of months ago I went out; they had to bring me back twice from death. Let me tell you something: when you die you ain\u2019t taking your wallet with you up there! You ain\u2019t even taking your underwear!\n\n[Verse 1: Necro]\nYou never went to jail, you\u2019re shook from the look of it\nI invented Hell when I took a shit\nMy religion is music and abusing bitches\nSnitch I\u2019ll make you a eunuch, a loser dickless\nSaget of the human trafficking racket\nBeat the shit out of Jesus for being a faggot\nSkeez into techno, douchebag die\nBelieve in Necro, you\u2019ll be crucified\nSpeak the gospel of an asshole like Simmons\nSelling Kiss caskets harassing women\nDon\u2019t test me, finish your breath G\nMy ministry is from a sinister ancestry\nCrass gynaecologist, fuck a female activist\nYou took it in your ass by your misogynist\nPlump like a putrid eighty-year-old bitch\nI\u2019ll worship you like Buddha\u2019s fat gold tits\n\n[Hook]\nDie, die, die\nWhen I hurt you - you die\nDie, die, die\nWhen I hurt you - you d-\n\n[Verse 2: Necro]\nA disgrace since birth, you\u2019ll soon be dead\nThe holiest place on earth an exit wound through your head\nDon\u2019t try to enter my plain of existence\nI\u2019ll blast the center of your brain with a biscuit\nNo matter what remain sadistic, maintain persistence\nBreak every chain of resistance\nAny lame gets in my way in this game\nI\u2019ll make sure every vein in your frame is spritzing\nFuck peace, you want it with me? Please\nYour seeds are now abductees from Chuck Cheese\nHit like Michael Spinks with a bike link\nAttack your think hole like an Inca with a spiked drink\nHad a tough career, kid I don\u2019t care\nI\u2019ve been suffering for years, Hell is right here\nShut your trap, that\u2019s enough shit out of you\nTrap you to clap you, I\u2019ll make a snuff flick out of you\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Bob Dylan]\nAnd I hope that you die\nAnd your death\u2019ll come soon\nI will follow your casket\nIn the pale afternoon\nAnd I\u2019ll watch while you\u2019re lowered\nDown to your deathbed\nAnd I\u2019ll stand over your grave\n\u2018Til I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re dead"}], "artist": "Necro"}
