Don't tell me  \"I don't feel it\" because I dont care because its real, you know. Like I had no other choice but to feel it\n\n[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]\nI've been emancipated from mental slavery, That's word to my rastas\nCell blocked mind so I got my head locked up\nMy third eye chakra was blocked and the flash from the cops\nMade this indigo path that I follow, that's word to my father\nWatch when the Babylon pass Got a stash in my basketball pants\nGot enough fire to light up a whole camp\nI an I never thought to inspire a grown man\nPROgression is the basis with eleven different phases\nThe faces of the Moon cause the Earth to start shaking\nThey say it's our world for the taking and Imma win it all for my girl and my bacon\nLately I've been thinking since it's dried up like raisins\nThe system's like bud when we break it\nThe slim foundation were undeveloped seeds in the middle\nThat's why they really need an individual\nSo I guess we're the biggest and we're setting up the villains for the rest of you niggas\nDeny? Nigga I'm the best don't forget it\nAll it took was 13 steps and I did it\n\n[Hook: Capital STEEZ]\nAnd today I got a feeling that I\u2019ve never felt\nAnd I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know what to say\nBut today I got a feeling like non before\nAnd I guess I can\u2019t I guess I can\u2019t I guess I can\u2019t explain\n\n[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]\nI was born to be a step ahead shit, they got the system to assist them\nWe got the system that turned us into Victims\nAll my aunts was living with 8 children plus section 8 is still trying to evict them\nSaid look at the world we\u2019re here living in\nI\u2019m too proud to say it ain\u2019t law abiding citizens\nIt\u2019s cuz I\u2019m black isn't it? Or the characteristics of your last statistic\nBastards said I couldn\u2019t define happiness and my master said I couldn\u2019t pass as a pacifist\nI dealt with more pain than a masochist\nAnd I hold back tears like a hankerchief\nI said I wanna be a rap star\nMom saw black cards and fast cars\nFuck Ferrari\u201ds, Bacardi and Parties I wanna change the world I'm Awfully sorry\nTime for me to be the next Bob Marley, Marcus Garvey or Mohandas Gandhi\nAnd follow MLK tips, JaKK rides shotty while we steer towards greatness\nAnd I still haven\u2019t found my placement\nCuz hip hop hasn't made a leap of faith yet\n\n[Hook: Capital STEEZ]\nAnd today I got a feeling that I\u2019ve never felt\nAnd I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know what to say\nBut today I got a feeling like non before\nAnd I guess I can\u2019t I guess I can\u2019t I guess I can\u2019t explain"}]}
