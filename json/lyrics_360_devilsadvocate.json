You will not see me coming, but mark my words, you will feel me inside you, for you are I, and I are you *Laughs Maniacally*\n\n[Ad-Libs]\nFuck yeah\nUh\nUh-ah uh-ah-ah, uh-ah uh-ah ah\u2014ah\n\n[Chorus (Partial)]\nBecause I'm raising hell\nIt ain't gonna raise itself\nAnd I could be a friend that you know, a friend of your own\nIt's better the devil you know than the devil you don't\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou won\u2019t see me the flesh, only ever in the mind (nup)\nWhich means I\u2019m in the flesh, but it's the head that I\u2019m inside (yep)\nYou'll never see a better vessel ever been designed (nup)\nEverywhere you look you\u2019ll see a devil in disguise (yes)\nThe mind that I\u2019m inside, yo, I try it on for size (let's go?)\nIf I\u2019m liking it, then I just might just commit a crime\n(Kinda suits me, ayy?) Then rightfully it's mine, if you with ya mates\nAnd hear \u201cSpeak of the devil\u201d that means I finally arrived (I'm here)\nI might be in ya mind, but I\u2019m dead forever (always)\nAnd if there\u2019s hell to pay then I\u2019m the motherfucking debt collector\n(Give me your fucking money) Last year sat on Seth Sentry's deltoids\nHelped him write a song called \"Hell Boy\"\n(You are so full of shit) I\u2019ve never felt joy\nAnd I don\u2019t speak much, the last time I said hello\nYou heard it in Adele's voice (from the other side)\n'Cause of me heavens gates are ruined\nIf I\u2019m in ya mind then you'll never make it through 'em (nup)\nEvery time the coppers find a death and they pursue it\nYo, the killers last words were \"The devil made me do it\"\nBut God made earth in seven days, bitch\nIt's been a pleasure to fuck it up every day since\nI\u2019m here to bring a balance to your mental health (yep)\nI'll make you feel the worst that you\u2019ve ever felt (I will, I will)\nI\u2019m the worst card the earth has been ever dealt\nPeople say I got the Devil smell, scent from hell\n\n[Chorus]\nIn this body never felt so fly (fly)\nWhy I'm here? Ain't gonna tell you lies (lies)\nBut I'm like \"Nah\u2014ah\u2014ah\u2014ah\nNah\u2014ah\u2014ah\u2014ah, bitch, I can't tell you why\"\n'Cause I'm raising hell (raising, raising hell)\nIt ain't gonna raise itself (raise it\u2014raise itself)\nAnd I could be a friend that you know, a friend of your own\nIt's better the devil you know than the devil you don't\n\n[Verse 2]\nI went motherfuckin' undercover, as an alter boy in the bell choir (yep)\nJust to swap all the holy water with hell fire (fire)\nI might look like Voldemort but I smell nicer\nLost the plot more than an older author with alzheimers\n(Where am I?) I choked out Soulja Boy with a belt, right\nFarted on his son then sold his daughter to Al-Qaeda\nThe advocate, not the devil himself\nI was sent here to help, a senator ascended from hell (I'm here)\nThe opportunity presented itself\nI couldn\u2019t say no, 'cause down there is sweaty as... well\nI\u2019m why America's wealth's in debt to itself\nAnd Kennedy fell, and nine-eleven as well\nThey bombing kids aged eleven and twelve and blame a terrorist cell\nAnd never mention all the oil that they gettin' as well\nFathered George Bush, raised him well (yep)\nI had him on the right path by the age of twelve (I did)\nBut I\u2019m ruthless, the motherfucking truth is\nWhen he was fifty-four\u2019s when I really started raising hell (kill 'em)\nThe devil's never been red before with a set of horns\nWith a pointy tail and a motherfuckin' metal fork (nah)\nYou\u2019ve been lied to, everything you\u2019ve ever thought\nThe devil is the banker with the money funding every war (facts)\nWhen I\u2019m around you\u2019re inclined to write FML\nPeople say I got the Devil smell, scent from hell\n\n[Chorus]\nIn this body never felt so fly (fly)\nWhy I'm here? Ain't gonna tell you lies (lies)\nBut I'm like \"Nah\u2014ah\u2014ah\u2014ah\nNah\u2014ah\u2014ah\u2014ah, bitch, I can't tell you why\"\n'Cause I'm raising hell\nIt ain't gonna raise itself\nAnd I could be a friend that you know, a friend of your own\nIt's better the devil you know than the devil you don't\n\n[Spoken]\nNow watch all these fucking cunts in Youtube comments say that I'm in the Illuminati and shit, 'cause I started dropping videos on the sixth of the sixth, and the Spotify playlist is Six. \"That means he must be Illuminati.\" I fucking wish I was, cunt. Pay off this fucking mortgage\n\n[Outro]\nBetter the devil you know than the devil you don't"}]}
