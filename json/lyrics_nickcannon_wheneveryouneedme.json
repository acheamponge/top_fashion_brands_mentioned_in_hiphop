Blige))\nWhenever you need me babe just call my name no matter whatever\nYou done you know that i'll be there i'm down for you\nWhatever you're goin through whenever you need me babe you know\nThat i'll be there\n\n(Verse 2 (Nick Cannon))\nYo every man needs a rider beside her my rider to is clinon was\nTo pick em up off the bottom whatever he need she got em\nAnd vise versa even though his style might hurt her a phone call\nIs a phone call to a fella but to women it falls under the\nSame umbrella it's trust plus honesty respect gotta jugle em all\nTry not to neglect cuz if something go wrong it be hard to\nCorrect they forgive but never forget no matter how many\nDiamonds you sit on they neck you look at invisible set they be\nThey be invisible next that's why i hold my home team down no\nMatter how much of this world i'm going around i'm gonna treat\nYou da right way it always feel good when you say...\n\n(Chorus (Mary J. Blige))\nWhenever you need me babe just call my name no matter whatever\nYou done you know that i'll be there i'm down for you\nWhatever you're goin through whenever you need me babe you know\nThat i'll be there\n\n(Verse 3)\nNow as soon as the media get a hold of the vocal they gonna try\nFigure the motive the reason i wrote who da girl on my arm\nAt the movie premiere who da one in the drop with the wind in\nHer hair poparatzzi\nWatch but to see pops don't like me and thats wherever i might\nBe so i need a girl to stand and to understand and stand\nNext to cannon cuz i got a plan and i ain't tryin put no weight\nOn ya girl but it's hard to have alove affair in front of\nThe world everytime you move every step you make bein watched\nPossibly videotaped that's why i need a place where i can\nEscape from and another soul and wich my soul can relate and i\nProbably make a lot of mistakes but i still need to hear\nSomebody say...\n\n(Chorus (Mary J. Blige))\nWhenever you need me babe just call my name no matter whatever\nYou done you know that i'll be there i'm down for you\nWhatever you're goin through whenever you need me babe you know\nThat i'll be there\n\nWhenever you need me babe just call my name no matter whatever\nYou done you know that i'll be there i'm down for you\nWhatever you're goin through whenever you need me babe you know\nThat i'll be there\n\nWhenever you need me babe just call my name no matter whatever\nYou done you know that i'll be there i'm down for you\nWhatever you're goin through whenever you need me babe you know\nThat i'll be there"}], "artist": "Nick Cannon"}
