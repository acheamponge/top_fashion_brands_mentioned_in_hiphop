A few friends came too, but whenever my family made that trip, I made sure my uniform was tight. I\u2019d \u201ciron\u201d the uniform under the bed. That\u2019s where everybody ironed their clothes.\n\nYou get two uniforms, so you keep one under the bed for your visit, so by the time the visit comes, it\u2019s nice and fresh because you been sleeping on it all week. That\u2019s like your visit uniform. During the rest of the week, nobody cares. On the visitors\u2019 floor, when my kids used to visit me with my wife, they had vending machines where you could get snacks and chips and everything that they don\u2019t have in commissary.\n\nPeople couldn\u2019t wait for the visit because then you could have like, hot wings you could put in the microwave! They got ill shit you could get in the vending machine. They had hot sandwiches and other food you could put in the microwave: ill snacks, doughnuts, a lot of things. Just things they don\u2019t have on the inside. They had this spicy chicken sandwich, and the name of it was Big Ass Chicken Sandwich. That was the name of it, yo! It was a spicy chicken sandwich like the one at Wendy\u2019s.\n\nIt was a spicy chicken patty, it had real jalape\u00f1os on it, and it really was a Big Ass Chicken Sandwich. It was about $4 or something like that. That was my favorite thing to eat. At every visit, I would get the Big Ass Chicken Sandwich. They also had the Big Ass Burger too. It would say it right on the package \u2013 Big Ass Burger.\n\nYou can\u2019t sneak it back up, though. They gotta strip search you. They gotta look in your butthole and all that. You gotta lift your nuts, cough, all that shit.\n\nAfter a while, I told my wife not to come because it was an 8-hour drive \u2013 four hours up to Mid-State and four hours back down. I didn\u2019t want her doing all that driving, you know what I mean? So I was like, \u201cDon\u2019t come. Just come when you feel like it, holidays or whatever. That drive is too long.\u201d Plus in the wintertime, it\u2019s bad up there. It\u2019s crazy. You know how many times after visiting the prison, people\u2019s families would be like, \u201cYo, we got into a car accident and our car flipped over!\u201d I used to tell them, \"Don\u2019t come up here. Come if you really feel like coming. Don\u2019t come thinking I need a visit, because I don\u2019t give a fuck. I don\u2019t need it.\u201d\n\nSo this producer me and Havoc did music with named King Benny, it just so happened that motherfucker lived in the town where the jail was at in Utica, and he\u2019d come and visit me every weekend. He lived five minutes from the jail. So I had a visit every weekend, and a Big Ass Chicken sandwich every weekend, sometimes a Big Ass Burger. It was crazy.\n\nHe hooked me up with real kicks too. We could order sneakers, but they was corny. They had bootleg Jordans in jail. They had a bootleg catalog with fake ass Jordans, fake Timbs, fake everything, because you can\u2019t have nothing that\u2019s over $50. They want to see the receipt from the store it came from.\n\nSo he used to kick sneakers under the table for me. I would buy them fake joints and wear them, he would come to the prison with new real J\u2019s on in my size. And while we were sitting, we\u2019d kick the shoes to each other under the table\u2014I\u2019d put on the real J\u2019s and he would put on the fake ones.\n\nOne time we did it, and we almost got caught. My man Benny is sitting right there in front of me, his back to the guards. I had to sit facing the guards. So I gotta look normal while I\u2019m taking off my sneakers and look like I\u2019m not doing nothing. I kicked my sneakers off, gave it to him. He kicked his sneakers off, kicked it to me, and one of the sneakers went flying to the side, almost to the next visiting table! I\u2019m like oh shit!\n\nMy boy tried to kick it over. I thought we was gonna get caught! We didn\u2019t though, but I looked pretty sus tryin\u2019 to act like nothin\u2019 was goin\u2019 on. But didn\u2019t matter, because I got some new J\u2019s. And I had a Big Ass Chicken Sandwich.\nFrom commissary kitchen: my infamous prison cookbook published by Infamous Books.\n\nYou can download the audio version of commissary kitchen: my infamous prison cookbook for free on Amazon", "year": null}]}
