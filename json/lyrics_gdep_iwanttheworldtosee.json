You on time huh?\nCause in the streets you never know where you can wind up\nNiggas acting kinda funny when I signed up\nAnd I don't know if it's the money or the wine truck\nBut I know their time's up rhyme what time up got up\nSling it to the conselour how she gone guide us?\nAnd I don\u2019t wanna stop\nIf these niggas wanna shop then a gun will pop there it go\nI play dirty in J-30's with their birdy\nThis ain't the old Lakers and nigga you ain't Worthy\nI pop Cris wit hot chicks who rock whips\nHottest shit since hot grits and stock tips\nYour cat spit just cause he's got lips\nTrying hit 26 rich and prosperous\nWhen reality sets thought you had the salary set\nNow here is your reality check\n\n[Joe Hooker singing]\nX4\nI want the world to see\n\n[Verse 3: G.Dep]\nI'm in the big things jets wit the big wings\nNo kid things y'all niggas is siblings\nI pop things you can feel them hot things\nWhen the Glock rings come through and you dropping\nIt's a pay thing you could tell by the grey ring\nMy play thing named May Ling from Beijing\nI break things timeless like paintings\nSit your five dollar ass down before I make change\nGotta put yo gats down before I take aim\nSpit what you need speed of a freight train, strange?\nNever seen a great reign?\nSon charted now look what you done started\nI pop heavy rock steady drop heavy\nCopped Mase and Teddy still you not ready\nWhen it all goes down real as the world be round\nI'll be here world renowned"}]}
