Might go out, die hard and end up in a hearse\nBut no time to think about the consequences\nThe years in jail, fuck the death sentence\nAll I know is that I need mad cash in a flash\nBefo' I gotta kill somebody ass\nMight as well be in jail or dead\nCuz if you ain't gettin paid then you ain't gettin ahead (that's word nigga)\nSittin in my room with the lights out thinkin'\nI'm alive, but I ain't livin, I'm leakin'\nI made my bed and I'ma lay in it\nBut I ain't gonna stay in it\nI might start sprayin shit\nI should've stayed in school, but that's a dead issue\nFuck a G.E.D., thats like toilet tissue\nAll my friends are hoodlums and hustlers\nRunnin with a bunch of stupid crazy motherfuckers\nNiggas fuckin their money up, niggas gettin knocked\nAnd jealous motherfuckers, they want the whole block\nThough I could start flippin gettin on a mission\n\nBut I need much more, no time for bullshittin'\nNiggas listen...\n\n[Chorus: Godfather Don - repeat 2X]\nThe H-E-A-T- makes me crazy\nI wanna bust somethin, figures, touch somethin'\nThe heat is on, got a niggas blood rushin'\nI wanna touch somethin, niggas bust somethin'\n\n[Verse 2: Prodigy]\nYo, all I know is guns, all I do is slug\nI'd rather plug you with the heater than to have you front\nMy life revolves around the snub 4th\nStay gettin those outside of New York\nBullets from the cornerstore, I'm bringin home a arsen\nInterstate 95 North to the Jackie Robinson\nWatch out for D's in caprices in tauruses\nEmpire mistakes for cops, mad nervous\nBack at home sell a few burners\nKeep a miz and a seven mil for my personal\nWalk with benevolence, holdin twin fifths\n380's in the whip, a mini-eagle for my chick\nThat nigga P is sick, I need a silencer connect, see me\nNiggas be lyin, tellin stories, tell it walkin'\nMy nigga's into drugs and extortion\nKnotty head for them niggas on the nightshift pumpin'\nThe heat is on nigga....\n\n[Chorus] - 6X"}], "artist": "Blaq Poet"}
