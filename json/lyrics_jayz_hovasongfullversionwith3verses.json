It's Hova the god ...\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell I'm the ghetto's answer to Trump\nI'm cancer to The Hamptons\n$20 million of guap, ransacking mansions\nIncrease the noise pollution soon as I land in\nDon't even trust uppity white folk, keep the cannon tucked\nNiggas try to lean on Jay, shots gonna stand you up\nGlocks gon' pop, y'all not understanding much\nI hustled for the ducats, well now I hustle for the rush\nLike fuck it, baby, I just love it\nChicks now, say they like the way I thug it\nSince my album dropped, my stock rose ... like I went public\nLadies, I love y'all, but I love my freedom more\nI love my niggas, love to see them ball\nI love Beans and Bleek\nThem niggas like my Peter and Paul\nMy disciples\nAnd that's right, we're coming for the title\nDo you believe? It's Hova the god ...\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhoever thought young Shawn Carter would change the game?\nUsed to rap to the raindrops off my window pane\nDuckin' the plain cops, pushing indo and 'cane\nAt the kitchen table, late night, no pen, just my brain\nFirst album, niggas loved me 'cause they thought I was poor\nGuess I'm successful, industry don't love me no more\nBut I'm the same nigga from your corner, bubblin' raw\nSkully tilted, pants saggin', damn near touching the floor\nAnd I come with do-rags to your so-called awards\nT-shirt with my chain out, like fuck y'all all\nRetrospect, ain't been the same since I lost my dad\nHe's still alive, but still, fuck you, don't cross my path\nA&Rs had me feelin' like Moss in the draft\nSo I turned the league out with Reasonable Doubt\nGet your CDs out\nLet's go song for song\nI'm the illest nigga doing it 'til y'all prove me wrong\nDo you believe?\nIt's Hova the god ...", "title": "Hova Song (Full Version with 3 Verses)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/16c23bf8d7a8a73a71d30d2ec47600b1.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "1999-12-28", "album": "Vol.\u00a03\u2026 Life and Times of S.\u00a0Carter"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
