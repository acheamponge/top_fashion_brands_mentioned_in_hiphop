You know. Make it work\nSummer rain is like my ad-lips???\n???\nRight Chris?\n(sound like)\nExtra precautions when they not needed\nWe do it like this like...\n\nI'm still awake... in the middle of the night\nTry to lay it down, try to close my eyes\n\n[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]\nAt night I can't sleep\nCause my heart skip a beat\nI can see it cause my heart on my sleeve\nI can see the deceased\nTear into the flesh of the weak\nCurrency bear the mark of the beast\nNever stand for the bull\nEven when the market asleep\nAnything I want is in arms reach\nAnd the score is so sweet\nBut the consequence is that\nI got to wear the mark of the thief\nI am the man with one hand\nStranger in a foreign land\nNew identity cost a grand\nIt's the miracle worker\nServing up the offering\nSo make the disabled walk again\nGot the melatonin, pouring in from the pineal gland\nLike the blind man that saw again\nLike el-Hajj Malik\nStreet cats fought for him\nAnd they never ate pork again\nBear witness to the\n\n[Hook]\nPower of transformation\nThat's the power of transformation\nThat's the power of transformation\nThat's the power of transformation\nIt's the power of transformation\nIt's the power of transformation\nIt's the power of transformation\nIt's the power of transformation\nMake it clap like they're giving you a standing ovation\nThe adulation is such a powerful high\nAnd as sour as my transportation\nWhen I am heading for the clouds in the sky\nStay clean as the department of sanitation\nEven though we from the gutter right\nThat's the power of transformation\nCaterpillar to the butterfly\nCaterpillar to the butterfly\nCaterpillar to the butterfly\nCaterpillar to the butterfly\nCaterpillar to the butterfly\nAt night I can't sleep, I toss and turn (x3)\nAt night I can't sleep\n\n[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]\nAt night I can't sleep\nCause my heart skip a beat\nI can see it cause my heart on my sleeve\nI can see the deceased\nTear into the flesh of the weak\nCurrency bear the mark of the beast\nNever stand for the bull\nEven when the market asleep\nAnything I want is in arms reach\nAnd the score is so sweet\nBut the consequence is that\nI got to wear the mark of the thief\nI am the man with one hand\nStranger in a foreign land\nNew identity cost a grand\nIt's the miracle worker\nServing up the offering\nSo make the disabled walk again\nGot the melatonin, pouring in from the pineal gland\nLike the blind man that saw again\nLike el-Hajj Malik\nStreet cats fought for him\nAnd they never ate pork again\nBear witness to the\n\n[Hook]\nPower of transformation\nThat's the power of transformation\nThat's the power of transformation\nThat's the power of transformation\nIt's the power of transformation\nIt's the power of transformation\nIt's the power of transformation\nIt's the power of transformation\nMake it clap like they're giving you a standing ovation\nThe adulation is such a powerful high\nAnd as sour as my transportation\nWhen I am heading for the clouds in the sky\nStay clean as the department of sanitation\nEven though we from the gutter right\nThat's the power of transformation\nCaterpillar to the butterfly\nCaterpillar to the butterfly\nCaterpillar to the butterfly\nCaterpillar to the butterfly\nCaterpillar to the butterfly\nAt night I can't sleep, I toss and turn (x3)\nAt night I can't sleep\n\n[Outro: Talib Kweli and Steffanie Christian]\nChange is God\nSurvival requires transformation\nNo one said it would be easy\nBut ain't nothing worth having, easy to get\nSo run towards the challenge\nI love the challenge\nEvery challenge is a new opportunity\nOf self-transformation\nSo run towards the challenge\nI run towards the challenge\nI run towards the challenge\nI run towards the challenge\n(fade)"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
