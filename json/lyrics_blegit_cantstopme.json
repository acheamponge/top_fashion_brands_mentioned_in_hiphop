wonder\nIs it the police trying to trap me?\nOr some fool who\u2019s out to jack me?\nI kept a gat, a strap of security\nShook all fools who really wasn\u2019t sure of me\n\u2018Cause I won\u2019t slip or either sleep\nI check you by the chin or the cheek\nA brother got tired of taking this route\nI asked the Lord if he could help me out\nI got on my knees and admitted my sins\nI need a way out for me and my friends\n\n[Chorus: Levitti + (B-Legit sample)]\nCan\u2019t stop me now\n(\u201cAin\u2019t nobody gon\u2019 stop me, mayne\u201d)\nCan\u2019t stop me, no, no\n(\u201cAin\u2019t nobody
