I'm from the handle pan\nWhere you may come for peace and leave the beach as half a man\nBut it ain't just Florida, see it poppin' up in all the land\nSome kind of new world order, I been looking for a god to damn\nI've worked for years at this; made a million appearances\nGot clearances all just to hear that girl say that's my fucking jam\nAnd here I am the fucking son of Sam\nSpit razorblades that's made of haze and taped to rubber bands\nNow where the fuck I am, I'm yet to discover and\nIf I'm coming down tonight I'll just drop me another gram\nThey broke me down so I adopted me a rougher plan\nGet rid of all those who been tripping our toes in a minute fold up them hands\nLive vibes light it up amongst a sea of lies\nWake on the other side flying through them neon skies\n\n[Hook]\nThis is that super ultrasonic phenom\nPitcher full of Jack, picture that with the beat on\nSnake and bat on the map challenge that - be gone\nFuck with us, we high enough to skydive beyond\nShe said she digs the neon (neon) lights\nShe said she digs the neon (neon) lights\nShe said she digs the neon (neon) lights\nShe wants to know what we on\nBlack shades, neon skies\nBlack shades, neon skies\nBlack shades, neon skies\nBlack shades, neon skies\nNeon-Ne-N-Ne- Neon skies\nBlack shades, neon skies\nBlack shades, neon skies\nNeon-Ne-N-Ne- Neon skies\n\n[Verse 2]\nGimme that Jack D and a little cigarette full of something nexus\nI'm Strange Music, mosh in pits and bouncers blocking exits\nBefore we signed the deal we flew to the Kansas City section\nWhere Tech and Trav confessed the fact our roster's lookin' reckless\nTo which I did agree and ordered us a fifth for three\nBartender morse code tatted that looks sick to me\nI used to battle rap some years ago and matter of fact I'm glad\nThat that had critics unsuspecting what this kid could be\nAnd here I am the fucking sick MC\nBrit kid to the prick it seems and something slick this chick agrees\nI'm in Miami where we all breathe at a different speed\nI've heard of last call but it never did exist to me\nPour another shot, eyes dilated\nI batter beef in bars and leave 'em feeling violated\nI asked her how she feeling now, are we alive?\nUs Skeptics even finding life inside them neon skies\n\n[Hook]\nThis is that super ultrasonic phenom\nPitcher full of Jack, picture that with the beat on\nSnake and bat on the map challenge that - be gone\nFuck with us, we high enough to skydive beyond\nShe said she digs the neon (neon) lights\nShe said she digs the neon (neon) lights\nShe said she digs the neon (neon) lights\nShe wants to know what we on\nBlack shades, neon skies\nBlack shades, neon skies\nBlack shades, neon skies\nBlack shades, neon skies\nNeon-Ne-N-Ne- Neon skies\nBlack shades, neon skies\nBlack shades, neon skies\nNeon-Ne-N-Ne- Neon skies", "title": "Neon Skies", "year": "2013-06-25", "album": "The War Within", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e384fbb42e445fb209514af1582b2973.440x440x1.jpg"}]}
