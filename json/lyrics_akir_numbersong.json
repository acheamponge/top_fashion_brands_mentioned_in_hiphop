It was late, but in\nMy face, I was hungry, so a nigga still ate.  Back on\nThe streets, still walking with The Beast and their nines.  Jumped in\nA ride and reclined, feeling the world was mine\nRoll a L and I picked up some wine \u2018cause shorty\u2019s fine\nLikes to have a good time, plus she knows all my rhymes\nTo all my niggas: safe journey through the world and these crimes\nThings come in due time\u2014one\u2014I\u2019m out with the dime\n\n[Verse 2: AKIR]\nIn one second, three amigos ran into the store\nPushed a negro, shot the gringo with a chrome forty-four\nWith the lingo [?] commanding his people\nThrough the dirt, we\u2019ll grow rich from this root of evil\n[?] at their ransack on Fifth Ave., stacked now\nWith a six NASDAQ.
