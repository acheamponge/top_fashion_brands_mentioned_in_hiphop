I put this dick in her\nAnd she just got baptized, I Luda-Christened her\nI'm the commissioner when it comes to spitting sick bars\nMy product potent like trusted dealers that flip raw\nAnd I'm spending fast as I'm getting cause tomorrow's not promised\nToday, nigga, what you think we make these hits for?\nIronically, seems like my life's your entertainment\nBetter that then having to show up for arraignment\nThat bitch I'm leaving with is not the bitch I came with\nMe, Los and Diddy, we got it, nigga, you name it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Los]\nPeep the cycle, I'll beat the psycho of every child smothered\nWhat I perfected I done injected into my child's mother\nThem clouds hover, she got a deal on some fly shit\nSo in turn, my son saw a world tour before I did\nOpen your eyelids, try to figure this king out\nFive months in the womb, and my son was living my dreams out\nWrote a recipe for all the dramas I stepped through\nCooked up something special and sent my mama to chef school\nCheck who? Nigga, my stripes' part of my game\nAll my dark nights turnt into white parties in Spain\nAt the villa chillin', soakin' it in\nLike I don't know where the infinity pool ends or the ocean begins\nMight send your bitch back with the wrap from the transport\nThem packs in her JanSport and some stamps on her passport\nYou past short, that's why I rock for the set\nI'm connected in high places like Wi-Fi on a jet (king)\n\n[Hook]"}]}
