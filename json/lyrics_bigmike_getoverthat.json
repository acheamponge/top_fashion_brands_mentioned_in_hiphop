I was bashful\nHow could I not be when baby had an ass full satin panties\nIn between her ass cheeks, got her number\n(Did you hit it?) No need to ask me\nWe kicked it for a couple of months and everything was shiny\nUntil the hoe couldn\u2019t find me\nRan behind me, even though she wouldn\u2019t admit the shit\nWe fell out of love, so I had to quit the bitch\nAnd it woulda been like any other hoe but it was complicated\nBaby was kinda tight so I hesitated\nAnd instead of getting my roll on\nI was a stupid muthafucka and got hurt tryin\u2019 to hold on\nI only wanted to be there for you and care for you forever, fool\nForever, fool, we folded\nI was fuckin\u2019 over her and somebody told it\nAnd all she coulda said was, \u201cDamn, I shoulda known it\u201d\nAnd me being the nigga that I am, I realize that I\u2019ve blown it\nTryna be the mack over here, huh\nAnd got hit with the payback of the year\n\u2018Cause when it came to mackin\u2019, I thought I wrote the book\nBut the book ain\u2019t tell me shit about the shoe being on the other foot\nTake a closer look, we used to be on\nBut now it\u2019s all gone anyway\n\n[Chorus]\nGet over that shit, look over that shit\nPrepare yourself to run into some more of that shit\nGet over that shit, look over that shit\nPrepare yourself to run into some more of that shit\nGet over that shit, look over that shit\nPrepare yourself to run into some more of that shit\nGet over that shit, look over that shit\nPrepare yourself to run into some more of that shit\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo it comes down to this, another heartbreaking moment\nOur feelings got hurt, we\u2019re feeling pissed, nobody\u2019s being missed\n\u2018Cause even though I like to bone you, baby\nYour attitude ain\u2019t worth about shit\nSo I\u2019ma say \u2018bye-bye\u2019 to ya, rather than lie to ya\nPackin\u2019 up your shit without giving a reason why to ya\n\u2018Cause you chose to play me rather than please me\nNow you cry \u2018cause you don\u2019t wanna leave me\nWell, baby, here\u2019s a tissue, look here\nNo, I won\u2019t miss you, don\u2019t cry on my shoulder, I don\u2019t wanna kiss you\nYou shoulda thought about it before you did it, huh\nBut you didn\u2019t, so I had to end it\nAnd, I meant it, ain\u2019t no gettin\u2019 back\nI\u2019m 86\u2019ing your ass like that\n\u2018Cause ya, used to be a sweet thang\nBut now you gotta hear me sing\nAbout your ass, so bye-bye, love\nYour smile was pretty, but your attitude was shitty\nSo shitty to the point where you can keep them gold rings\nHuh, know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019?\n\n[Chorus]\nGet over that shit, look over that shit\nPrepare yourself to run into some more of that shit\nGet over that shit, look over that shit\nPrepare yourself to run into some more of that shit\nGet over that shit, look over that shit\nPrepare yourself to run into some more of that shit\nGet over that shit, look over that shit\nPrepare yourself to run into some more of that shit\nGet over that shit, look over that shit\nPrepare yourself to run into some more of that shit\nGet over that shit, look over that shit\nPrepare yourself to run into some more of that shit\nGet over that shit, look over that shit\nPrepare yourself to run into some more of that shit\nGet over that shit, look over that shit\nPrepare yourself to run into some more of that shit"}], "artist": "Big Mike"}
