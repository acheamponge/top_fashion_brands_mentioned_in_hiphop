{"songs": [{"lyrics": "Psychologists have said it takes 21 days to make or break a habit. On the 22nd day, you\u2019ve found the way.\n\nOn December 3rd, one day before my 44th birthday I will embark on a 22 Days challenge to go completely vegan, or as I prefer to call it, plant-based!! This all began a few months back when a good friend and vegan challenged me to embrace a \u201cplant-based breakfast\u201d everyday. It was surprisingly easier on me than I thought\u2026\n\nWhy now? There\u2019s something spiritual to me about it being my 44th birthday and the serendipity behind the number of days in this challenge; 22 (2+2=4) coupled with the fact that the challenge ends on Christmas day\u2026It just feels right!\n\nSo you can call it a spiritual and physical cleanse. I will post my progress\u2026 Any professional vegans out there that have any great food spots please help out! Please ha. I don\u2019t know what happens after Christmas. A semi-vegan, a full plant-based diet? Or just a spiritual and physical challenge? We\u2019ll see\u2026\n\nBest of luck and health!\n\nP.S. B is also joining me.\n\nI will let my friend Marco explain the benefits of a plant based diet here.", "title": "22 Days Challenge", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf0f68ee56f29c8542ad805c6419682b.676x676x1.jpg", "year": "2013-12-03", "album": null}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
