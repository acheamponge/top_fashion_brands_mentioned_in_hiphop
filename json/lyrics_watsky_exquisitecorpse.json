I sew on an arm. Then you lend a hand\nWe each add our piece\nNow, what kind of beast have we made?\nLet\u2019s find out!\n\n[Verse 1: Watsky]\nI woke up Sunday to a bloodshot sky\nRobot overlords goose step by\nShoulda listened when we had the juice to try\nAnd Bill the Science Guy told us that \u201cthe end is nigh!\u201d\nLately it\u2019s been getting harder to\nSurvive, since the Hive started to\nBan American refugees from being a damn part of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Antarctica\nA bum begged me for a bill he could borrow\nBabbling some shit about \u201cthere\u2019s still a tomorrow\u201d\nHe said that \u201clegend has it, there\u2019s still a Baja Grill and a Sbarro\nAt the top of Mount Kilimanjaro\u201d\nAnd so desperate, I set out from the deserts out in Portland\nUntil my thirsty horse collapsed in the scorched sand\nI promised to myself heart and soul\nI\u2019d crawl across this dead world for those garlic rolls\n\n[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]\nYo, kid, let go of the dead horse\nStop crying, need a ride? Hop in my red Porsche\nEat something homie, you look bony and frail\nNow why the hell would you take the Oregon Trail?\nRemember back in grade school, that stupid computer game?\nYou shoulda known better, now there\u2019s no one but you to blame\nDying of dysentery, don\u2019t climb to the enemy\nI\u2019ma take you underground where the hive resistance be\nApparently a colony of people are out there\nA garden full of veggies, even garlic they sprout there\nLeader General Bieber who be running shit down there\nFound a way to end the drought, bring out the swimwear\nSoon as we pulled up we heard drilling noises\nChildren started dancing, even grown folk joined in\nLike a hydrant in the Bronx, water shot up in the air\nBut was boiling and as hot as solar flares\n\n[Verse 3: Grieves]\nOoowee, ain\u2019t that a bitch?\nNobody believed it 'til the first wave hit\nThe ground started shaking and the sky went red\n(Mayday! Atlanta\u2019s been lost, Justin Bieber is dead)\nNo! God damn, another one down\nColonies of people living under the ground\nRallied against the clowns, a resistance was born\nThey fight for mankind and the existence of porn (let\u2019s go!)\nBack on the surface life eaters\nAvoiding wild packs of North American beavers\nCreepers and face feeders\nFearing the great reaper\nYou\u2019re either gonna get eaten or beat with a pay meter\nThis is real shit homie, dog eat dog\nMore like robot clown eats man and whole squad\nGraffiti on the wall says \u201cthere is no god\u201d\nBut there is still homemade vodka, and that\u2019s cool\n\n[Verse 4: Wax]\nHomemade vodka, pour a shot up then I swill it\nI\u2019m the only person left who remembers how to distill it\nIt\u2019s the most popular product in the underground economy\nSo I\u2019m the most popular person in my underground colony\nAll the resistance leaders they throw shots down\nIn my bar after they fight the robot clowns\nAs of late they\u2019ve been stressed and depressed\n'Cause the chances of us winning are becoming less and less\nWe lost the captain of the human army\nMorale's really low and a lot of people are starving\nI\u2019m still wondering how this all happened\nIs this even real, or am I just on acid?\nThe clowns are advancing down\nI use the word \u201cdown\u201d cause they\u2019re coming underground\nWait\u2014what\u2019s that sound? It\u2019s kinda loud\nHoly shit! There they are right now!\n\n[Verse 5: Adam Vida]\nCalm down soldier, this is no time to be a fink\nWe can beat these clowns, okay, we just need to think\nI\u2019ve lost ten men this week, I can\u2019t sleep a wink\nBut this the last place on earth a guy can get a decent drink\nSo darned if we lose this bar to these useless zombie bastards\nI\u2019d rather starve than be boozeless\nSo I put barbed wire slabs on the fences\nThat should buy us some time to plan our defenses\nPick up the chairs and trash cans off the floor\nStack 'em up on the front door to jam up the entrance\nAin\u2019t got grenades, but we still might be saved\nI just found fifty diet coke cans and some breath mints\nFill the trash cans to the brim with the cola\nWhen the robots break in toss the mints in the soda\nSee the blast won\u2019t hurt 'em but it\u2019ll get 'em wet certainly\nIt\u2019ll mess up their wiring and disrupt their circuitry\nIf it don\u2019t work though, my next plan cannot fail\nWe drink the vodka\u2014shot after shot 'til we\u2019re too drunk to feel pain\nSpark up a flame, and turn the bottles that remain into Molotov cocktails\nI\u2019ve had it with you clowns, I\u2019ve reached my limit\nYou may have killed my captain, but I\u2019m the lieutenant\nAnd I won\u2019t let you terrorize us, wait just a minute\nThat ain\u2019t no robot zombie, man, what the hell is it?!\n\n[Verse 6: Rafael Casal]\nAdam! Ah! I didn't mean to scare ya'\nDude, that\u2019s not a robot, it\u2019s just Iggy Azalea\nMusta hid up in the bar to learn about who we are\nThen report back to the captain of the folks attackin' my favorite rap stars\nOh shit, quick! Hit her with some fuckin' duck-tape\nShe came to sing-rap & give us all some undercut fades\nLo-fi beats transmittin telegraphic autotune\nHelp! She\u2019s inside my head, and I don\u2019t think I am immune\nBeen repo-d, I think I\u2019m in deep, I am weeping at the seams\nForfeiting my dreams of keepin' the streets G code\nOnly way to outrun it is doublin' up on the track\nAny and everyone get up and metal mean it\nJust puttin' the pedal into it\nNow we taking over the tempo and tunin' it\nNever gone let a lesser demon ruin it, so I\u2019m inducing it\nDoomin it all, I\u2019m undoin' it, deuces I'm dippin\nWho comin' with the kid?
