know I got your back\nCause you know I got your back\n\nAny problem getting started\nBring the heat and bring it to arrive\nCause you know I got your back\nCause you know I got your back\nWhy\nCause you know I got your back\n\nEven if I\u2019m busy at work\nOr with my girl humping\nHomie if you need me I\u2019m coming\nIn the closet where my heater\u2019s at\nLoad up the duffel bag K\nWith the drum and that 44 mag\nJump in my ride and smash\nAnybody fucking with\nMy mother fucking niggas\nThat\u2019s they ass\n\nYo I beat it in a jiff\nThey couldn\u2019t find the other homies\nBut I got them bangs with me\nLeft anything lead it\u2019s iffy\nAnd for your brain strictly\nTry to run and I\u2019m aiming for your kidney\nNo matter what the season\nLight it up like Christmas\n\nMy nigga know to call me\nCause he know I\u2019m with the business\nI reciprocate although I\u2019m a thug\nI give a hug, blow a hug\nA pound for a pound\nA slug for a slug\nI hit you with the game\nYou know I hit you with the slug\nCause if you fuck with one of us\nThen you gets no love\n\nWhy do I roll in my truck like that\nWith the heat on my lap\nCause you know I got your back\nWhy\nCause you know I got your back\nCause you know I got your back\n\n\nAny problem getting started\nBring the heat and bring it to arrive\nCause you know I got your back\nCause you know I got your back\nWhy\nCause you know I got your back\n\nHey I\u2019ll be the first nigga\nTo roll out whenever you call\nAnd I don\u2019t give a fuck if my\nBitch was tripping I was there Dawg\nIf you ever can depend on anybody\nThat\u2019ll be me\nI might bullshit for a minute\nTrying to get me a little sleep\nBut I shank that shit\nGet myself up quick\nI might light up a new blunt\nAnd then I\u2019m out that itch\nOn a highway for miles\nWith my music turned up\nLoud, bouncing going wild\nLike with the \u201cfuck this niggas\u2026\u201d\nAnd I knew it had to be something\nTo get me out because\nYou know I didn\u2019t want to be fussing\nAnd hear my bitch mouth\nYou were going about your tactics\nWhile I love you know doubt\nYou said take care of them kids\nAnd fuck what life dish out\n\nAnd you meant that\nAnd every time you left\nNigga\nYou said that\nCheck it\nBut any nigga that would ride\nAnd be with that\nThat\u2019s why I got your back\nNo lie\nNigga\nI cross my heart and hope to die\n\nWhy do I roll in my truck like that\nWith the heat on my lap\nCause you know I got your back\nCause you know I got your back\nWhy\nCause you know I got your back\n\nAny problem getting started\nBring the heat and bring it to arrive\nCause you know I got your back\nCause you know I got your back\nWhy\nCause you know I got your back\n\nOh drop my talk\nWith real niggas\nSo when you hit me\nI\u201dm down to smash\nWhether it\u2019s personal\nBusiness or it\u2019s time to get the cash\nEx amounts or down fall\nBetween us all we still stand tall\nWe still remain men of honor\nWe niggas fuck off\n50 caliber bust up on\nThe track and go though street shit\nHalf the hood niggas and thugs\nThat\u2019s who  I be with\nTrust each other with secrets\nThat you take to the grave\nNutty Knocc Out Baby Gangsta\nBig Loc my Folk\nLou Reed new west\nSorta blaze up the smoke\nFor you dubs\nIf you\u2019re listening\nThe lines you can quote\n\nAll my cons went for broke\nThe savages so gone for loc\nBitches trip off appearance\nWhile haters\nChecking how we roll\n\nMy gang falls cold\nJust like this life\nPlay the cards\nThat you\u2019re dealt\nIt\u2019s guns at night\nTo let you know\nWhere you\u2019re grown\nAnd I can feel where you\u2019re right\nI got no friends just loved ones\nLike millers reaching your war\n\nWhy do I roll in my truck like that\nWith the heat on my lap\nCause you know I got your back\nCause you know I got your back\nCause you know I got your back\n\nAny problem getting started\nBring the heat and bring it to arrive\nCause you know I got your back\nCause you know I got your back\nCause you know I got your back\n\nNo nuts no glory\nWe trade war stories\nAnd any time I need\nYou was there in a hurry\nNigga I\u2019ll squeeze the hammer\nBefore I let you get worried\nLong as I got your back\nYou don\u2019t never gotta worry\nFor you nigga\nI\u2019ll get my Chucks dirty\nScope a nigga fumble\nWhen I\u2019m with that 30 30\n\nI was a nobody\nBefore this blow game\nMy nigga Loc set me down\nAnd laced me up on cocaine\nMoney for sure thing\nNo more petty change\nTake my niggas to the line\nAnd introduce them to the range\nAnd if a red on the bangs\nHook the thing\nNigga cross that gun range\nWatch the bullets start to rain\nCheck with the chain\nThese streets bring pain\nBut as long as I\u2019ve got\nMy niggas\nI\u2019m gonna remain the same\nRemain sane\nA baby gangsta to my grave\nMy niggas I will never stray\nOn  my back I will lay\n\nWhy do I roll in my truck like that\nWith the heat on my lap\nCause you know I got your back\nCause you know I got your back\nCause you know I got your back\n\nAny problem getting started\nBring the heat and bring it to arrive\nCause you know I got your back\nCause you know I got your back\nCause you know I got your back", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3c8c73bab3673678115a8f87a90d00ea.529x529x1.jpg", "year": "2009-01-02"}]}
