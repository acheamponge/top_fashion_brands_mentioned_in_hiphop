Not until we all dead and shit\nMy headstone read \"Nefarious\" that's all and that's it\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Second Verse]\nThe car hit the corner, felt the slug enter my chest\nBurnin' like some brimstone initiatin' the process of death\nI felt my soul slippin' into that dark abyss\nMy body lettin' go, bowel movement and then I piss\nMy soul lifts, closed eyes, lookin' down at the scenery\nThinkin' \"Oh no that can't be me with intestines layin' in the street\"\nSend the sheet, cover me up, stuff me into the body bag and close it\nFeel my body bloatin', I feel my body floatin'\nI know my enemies gloatin', smokin' blunts and celebratin'\n\"X-Raided Loc is dead!\"\nJust maybe either Heaven or Hell is waitin', now my vision's fadin'\nPurgatory is my home\nMy soldiers heard the story, so now it's on nigga\n\n[Chorus] (.5x)\n\n[Third Verse]\nNow don't you cry for me, FUCK pourin' out your rum\nRound up the thugs and watch slugs pourin' out your gun\nAnd it's begun, enemies best to run from dusk til' dawn\nGot a vendetta, seekin' revenge like that nigga from spawn\nYou a pawn and I'm the King, but you the one that's in check\nBlack roses on your grave, ultimate disrespect\nCollected obituary pages for the lives thats ending\nStep into the mortuaries daily, so many funerals attended\nI never intended to be a thug but destiny drug me in\nGrim Reaper already got a grave to plug me in\nNo way around it, one of these days I'm gonna have to meet the creator\nNobody on Earth is perfect, I hope God ain't a PLAYA HATER\n\n[Chorus] (.5x)"}], "artist": "X-Raided"}
