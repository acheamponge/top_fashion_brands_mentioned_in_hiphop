Ron Hubbard just like Joseph Smith\nMillions of people on Earth could follow a flying turd\nGo tweet her, go get my dick sucked by a bird\nMore bio weapons enter my lungs soon\nMore like Aleister Crowley then Sun\nMyung Moon\nUp to no good like the night before Halloween\nPut your fuckin mask on and follow me\nThrough the colony\nMarijuana all in me\nStill cold and evil\nThrow your kids off a cliff like a golden eagle\nLook manorexic all I need is a exit\nI took a dump last night now I'm on some next shit\nTook a dump last night now I'm on some next shit\nFucked a girl last night she might've been infected\nFucked a girl last night I coulda been infected\nAll because when I was a kid I was neglected\nBought a gun last night now I am protected\nBought a gun last night now I am protected"}]}
