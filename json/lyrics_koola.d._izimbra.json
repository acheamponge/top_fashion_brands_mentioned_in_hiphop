Quick\nSomebody slap my back\nYou know this track is slap\nAll the other tracks is whack\nJust bought a lighter with a titty chick on it\nShe looks Amish, all she need's a bonnet\nHoller with me. Five dumplings in a box\nJuice is a dollar fifty, call me papa-thrifty\nCall me Tito Puente\nCall me Daisy Fuentes\nCall me Elvis Priestlay\n???\nCall me Shelia E\nCall me ???\nCall me when you think you can't finish your bag of Cheetos\nI'm at the pizza hut, I'm at the taco bell\nI'm at the combination pizza hut and taco bell\nI've got the taco smell, that pescado smell\nI got a lot of smells\nI've rolled a lot of Ls\nI've rolled a lot of sushi\nRolling fat like John Belushi\nCall me Desi Arnaz, dog\nI love the lucy\nThrow some trees on it\nKool A.D.'s on it\nYou don't have to worry about anything\nHe's on it\nI'm in the third person\nI'm a nerd person\nI cannot tell a lie, like Washington I'm hella fly\nI'm on the one bill.\nPlus I'm dum ill\nI'm chopping cherry trees.\nGirl wanna marry me\nAnd I'm Kool A.D\nAll the females know I'm Kool AD\nKool AD\nAll the females know I'm Kool AD"}]}
