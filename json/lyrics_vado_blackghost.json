Most hated, incorporated with wealth\nUnderrated, I felt had to operate it with help\nSeparated myself in these decorated to bail\nGot educated and dealt with places safe than the melt\nGod gift as a kid, blockin' up all previous\nLike who's not scared of chain too on that park bench\nWatch keep shit and shapon sick\nYou stick to conscience, hit the corner, take over Walkman's\nLike G money and that Wrangler\nShowin' this new drug that I had, niggas it's danger\nSpittin' Basquiat, I'm a painter\nEvery hard verse, great off work, you can hang up\nNo need to read the book when the author's here\nEverywhere I look feds parkin here\nEmpty out the clip in yo partner's beard\nWhy'd he get a shave? Anesthesia and the partners chill\nYo I be creepin' slow in the black ghost (all day)\nSee me slickin' those off the black ghost (whats up)\nI be fuckin' hoes in the black ghost (hah!)\nGetting high, UFO in the black ghost\nYo I be creepin' slow in the black ghost (all day)\nSee me slickin' those off the black ghost (whats up)\nI be fuckin' hoes in the black ghost (hah!)\nGetting high, UFO in the black ghost\nAll my niggas can wait 'cause soon all my niggas be straight\nAnd all my niggas will wait then what? All my niggas is safe\nBanana clips with the K so that all my niggas be safe\nThe quick to pitch every day, you don't know my niggas be late\nWait, Frank Noola when I'm last tappin er\nDom's all up in his face like the smack ballad\nWas in the lake but move water like the back paddle\nThey try to name the place so all deserve to mack at you\nB4 the C4\nWas drug trafficking, traveling, make em detour\nPayin' preachers, coliseum, listen we need more\nGrantin' wishes, drippin' 6's, preachers off D4\nWe da best, I don't see the rest\nAnd I'm a be the best so I don't need the rest\nNeed a short stopper, not without a G to catch\nMy niggas drove high faster than a G a pack\nYo I be creepin' slow in the black ghost (all day)\nSee me slickin' those off the black ghost (whats up)\nI be fuckin' hoes in the black ghost (hah!)\nGetting high, UFO in the black ghost\nYo I be creepin' slow in the black ghost (all day)\nSee me slickin' those off the black ghost (whats up)\nI be fuckin' hoes in the black ghost (hah!)\nGetting high, UFO in the black ghost\nI'm gone", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/e2d9824f3848684bc687e9cad8889c34.687x595x1.jpg"}]}
