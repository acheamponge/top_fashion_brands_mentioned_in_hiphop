Smack you in the face for no reason\nFlow beating.  See me, man?  I live in no seasons\nThe sun, the moon, the star, the tune\nThe man that\u2019ll go to the bar and get drunk\nHigh and dumb like I was not able to home, trying to run\nYou on the fry.  Try and find wealth from the T Dot, the weed spot\nSee me in my underwear and Reeboks\nDoing absolutely nothing\nBut rapping\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz and 4th Pyramid]\nA glutton eating over and over again\nI want my sandwich bigger than my pen\nAnd if the mic is cracking, I\u2019m trying to sell you that\nGo to the GNC and see what\u2019s cracking\nTell the titans who clashing\nAnd watch me sell \u2018em rap.  I\u2019m open\nFood-mashing, brood-bashing\nYour bar.  Asking a star\nTo buy a CD.  See me at double-D 19\nRhyme fiend.

Coming through, my pen short\nIt\u2019s not for long\nKnown to snuff a cop\nPiss in his pocket, snuffing him in his chin and\nShow him the Glock like, \u201cWhat, bitch?  You owe me reparations\u201d\nPut 41 through your back for fronting.  I\u2019m dirty\nDirty.

I hope it\u2019s that B Real \u2018cause these Cypress Hills\nOf skills that\u2019ll make me have to get blunted off krills\nBefore you finally admit you heard C\n\u201cInsane in the Brain,\u201d playing with membranes in my mind\nSo I make sure that you turn back your twine and intertwine\nWeave and wind, see the mind\nSee, this is why I\u2019m about to eat that shit\nStop looking at my dick unless you ready to be the dick\nWith the rug, man, I will cock-slap you\nRock, rap to, got to ask you\nGet off me, police officer.  I will piss in your mother\u2019s coffee\nYo, I will put my dick in your tea\nOn some tai chi shit\nOh my Lord, high beam me, see me spit\n\u201cAngel and The Preacher\u201d\n15 G\u2019s on the CD\u2014that\u2019s what I wrote"}]}
