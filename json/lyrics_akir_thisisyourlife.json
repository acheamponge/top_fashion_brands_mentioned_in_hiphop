Nah, stop the crying.  I can\u2019t take this no more, man.  All I do is bring food home to these kids.  I got a roof over your head and you watch fucking soap operas all day and lay on your ass.  And you\u2019re gonna tell me about me?  Yo, fuck this shit.  Man, I\u2019m out of here.  B, I\u2019m out.  Hey!\n\n[Verse 1: AKIR]\nYo, they say that we\u2019re endangered species.  AKIR\u2019s thesis is\nTo survive ten times ten.  Not in a ten by ten\nTen times out of ten, they got a plan for my\nHard rocks that have not had babies that start again\nHe stole her love.  How could she ever give her heart again?\nShe opened up.  He closed the door, never had sparks again\nWent through some men to validate she\u2019s a queen\nNever found a king.  The pain made her turn to a fiend\nFeeling low, getting high the only way she sees dreams\nStays at home, watching soaps, thinks she part of the screen\nTo get away from a day and the kid\u2019s hunger screams, she buys\nSomething fly, though it seems out of her mean\nYo, behind, she still gets ahead.  This dude was real red\nSomething on his head.  Plus, she liked the way he worked it\nIn bed.  Thirsting to wed, settle down is what [?] did\nAnd so she did it too, simply to fight the ridicule\nHe made her life miserable.  Except the kids, of course\nSo they got a divorce up in court.  Child support\nHearings bad as Hell and the only pair of earrings\nChanel perfume while her suit was crisp, splitting\nShe screams, \u201cFrom the beginning, situations was trife\u201d\nThe judge says, \u201cI don\u2019t care, bitch.  This is your life\u201d\n\n[Hook: AKIR]\nEven though there\u2019s trouble, we\u2019ll still be on the hustle\nStuck behind the struggle, we\u2019re still ready to rumble\nAlthough we built it up, it\u2019s still ready to crumble\nFoundation ain\u2019t tight, man, this is your life\nForever in the game, it\u2019s hard not to fumble\nTrying to maintain or strive but still stumble\nRocking big chains, it\u2019s hard to stay humble\nForever in a fight, child, this is your life\n\n[Verse 2: AKIR]\nFirst step behind the eight ball.  Can\u2019t even crawl\nAin\u2019t no time to watch your back.  Thoughts of that caught\nSome cats, so cautious acts come out as fear\nBig dogs in your ear with their 40s of beer become\nAccessories to your New Year.  Freshman year\nSituation cloudy as a child but now clear\nProblems seem distance but they\u2019re still near\nHouse needs money for diapers.  Uncle\u2019s a lifer\nPops left fast.  No gas left in your lighter\nMoms getting high, listening to Earth, Wind & Fire\nOld-timers tell you how they always dreamed to retire before\nTheir life expires.  Doing wild shit made you a livewire\nLooking for fame, pops dropped the ball, sub in\nThe game.  Your terrain, so you\u2019re doing your thing\nBig chains and lots of women lock chains and switching linen\nIt\u2019s only the beginning.  Losing your mind to keep winning\nAnd while you focus on immediate living, they\u2019re having\nChildren and classmates focus on glass ceilings.  Only to\nClear up their debt without facing arrest.  The streets\nGot you pet niggas, so you\u2019re wearing a vest\nStress internally hexed by society\u2019s death threats\nBorn in the struggle, always grew up in trouble, where niggas\nSnuff you just to prove their muscle.  Live for their money\nTo double in bundles, ready to die for their hustle\n\n[Hook: AKIR]\nEven though there\u2019s trouble, we\u2019ll still be on the hustle\nStuck behind the struggle, we\u2019re still ready to rumble\nAlthough we built it up, it\u2019s still ready to crumble\nFoundation ain\u2019t tight, man, this is your life\nForever in the game, it\u2019s hard not to fumble\nTrying to maintain or strive but still stumble\nRocking big chains, it\u2019s hard to stay humble\nForever in a fight, child, this is your life", "year": "2004-11-15", "album": "Street Edition Vol. 1 & 2", "image": "https://images.genius.com/509e7a4852ad536f53153265417b296d.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "AKIR"}
