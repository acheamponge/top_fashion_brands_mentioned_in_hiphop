It don't matter on the color of your skin\nRight now you either positive or you negative\nI got friends in high places, multiple races\nAnd coaches on my side, all you got is paper\n\n[Hook]\nIlluminati want my mind, soul and my body\nSecret Society trying to keep their eye on me\nBut I'ma stay incogni' in places they can't find me\nMake my moves strategically\nIlluminati want my mind, soul and my body\nSecret Society trying to keep their eye on me\nBut I'ma stay incogni' in places they can't find me\nMake my moves strategically", "year": "2008-04-22"}]}
