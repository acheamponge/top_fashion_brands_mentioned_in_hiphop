Really ill?\nRun up on you, hit you with Israeli steel yo we really will\nThrough windshields, windpipes and car seats\nYou die on the belt parkway next to Canarsie\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm a goon in a world of atheists and religious fanatics\nPimps, whores, drug dealers, drug addicts\nRock stars, rappers, actors and other characters\nStarfuckers and cocksuckers and million dollar savages\nNegotiate with blowtorches to faces\nVacation, the golden nugget, made a fortune in Vegas\nI'm the greatest, perfect methods of execution painless, popped in the ear of the stainless\nLeave even geniuses brainless\nLeave the general population shocked and horrified\nFucking with me you might as well have been born to die\nMy values are loyalty, truth, respect, and honor\nMy family's royalty, my life is an endless drama\nMy art is death and I'm about to paint masterpieces\nCatastrophes, shattered dreams, amputees\nForgiveness is between you and god I just arrange the meeting\nI just arrange the firing squad, arrange the bleeding, I'm a goon\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/457870257e417a35d5715090c07a987d.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "The Hour of Reprisal", "year": "2008-09-16"}]}
