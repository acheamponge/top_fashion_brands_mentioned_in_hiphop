The same dish, different dressing\nThe same priest, different confession\nBut will still give you a blessing yeah\nA baptism in blood, in fact it was a flood\nIn fact it was some grub who packed triggers and mug\nA whole nation, this is empire\nThe question is can we aspire to any higher?\n\n[Hook: Amy True] x2\nWe're living through the fall of the empire\nWe're living through the fall of the empire\nAnd we don't even know what is meant by it\nAnd we don't even know what is meant by it\n\n[Verse 2: Amy True]\nSee, any foundation that is built on greed\nRaping and pillaging will never succeed\nWe're living in the age of information\nEnslavement, call it colonisation\nI call is straight piss taking\nCall it money or lose your debt making\nBreath taking, soul destroying, back breaking\nWhere they crack whips for fake staters\nOur society is broken down\nSo I don't get a loan or credit cards\nSee that is out of bounds\nFreezing all your assets, stopping any bank withdrawals\nRead in to the future cause the past is shiowing many flaws\nWe are not collateral, we are something greater than\nTake a stand, let's all take our money out of filthy banks\nMental evolution, no confusion built communities\nUntil my last breath, I won't stop until we all are free\nShouting People's Army, see I kow there's something blessed in me\nCause when it all falls down I know there's so much meant for we\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Akala]\nColonise a savage take what isn't a land she inhabits\nThen we justify it by claiming that we already had it\nCause who needs facts when we got force?\nWho needs their own minerals, we'll just take yours\nWe ain't talking bout music when we say tours\nRape mothers and mother nature 'cause they both our whores\nTell our kids every day that crime don't pay\nBut there's no way we believe the bullshit we say\nCause it's clear as the light of day\nThe light is lighting up the way\nOf those who trade in graves cause death does pay, yea\nSupply arms to both sides in the fight\nAnd if you ain't frightened you ain't paying attention to your alliance\nI know something that we ain't learned\nThat, yea, maybe hell is real and one day they'll burn\nBut in the meantime, sure they'll earn\nTill their empire's done and another one gets its turn\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Akala]\nIt's over, the fall\nIt's over", "year": "2015-03-30", "album": "Knowledge Is Power II", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7c518a58eebfd479e5ad2216b0cd1a85.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
