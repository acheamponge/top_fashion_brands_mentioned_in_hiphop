I'm tryna paint a picture\nTried to force a nigga hand and make me pull this trigger\nBut back on Lenox Ave. and church, I sold my first Perc\nBack when Porter water used to quench a nigga thirst\nMe and Rell in the field, that's a task force\nLike we need more than a mil' on our dashboards\n\n[Chorus]\nI tell 'em, \"I feel like I live my life out this duffle bag\" (Duffle bag)\nAnd I won't stop until I hit millions in cash (Yeah)\nI feel like I live my life out this duffle bag (Duffle bag)\nAnd I won't stop until I hit millions in cash (Mil's)\nI feel like I live my life out this duffle bag (Duffle bag)\nAnd I won't stop until I hit millions in cash (Mil)\nI feel like I live my life out this duffle bag (Duffle bag)"}]}
