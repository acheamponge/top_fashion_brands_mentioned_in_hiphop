Yeah but not the Canon camera 7D\nI'm whiskey off this Landy\nI don't know when I'll be sober again\nI'm just now falling down from the sky\nFinally coming down off my high\nIf it wasn't for the water the rap game would be dry\nSo I feed the soil life, resuscitate the game\nBreathe life back into every real nigga that we lost, mane\n\n[Hook: Cousin Fik]\nUh, he an animal, a beast\nHe don't eat, nigga he feast\nSame jeans for weeks\nOut here with the zombies, fiends and tweaks\n\n[Verse 2]\nDo the development while I might better tetch it don't wanna get caught loose\nSome of these niggas act ill when they get on pills and courage juice\nA lot of these dudes ain't real, lot of these cats are synthetic\nSwervo, counterfeit, yeah nigga I said it\nI just scribble on top of suckers up on my solid-dude list\nI don't need no liabilities, I can't be taking no risks\nGotta say I found, go hard like them Marion Barbarians\nWhen there's beef can't be no vegan or vegetarian\nIn the streets of Calif-harm-ia don\u2019t let the palm trees mislead ya\nCome out here with that tough guy attitude and we'll bleed you\nEvery time I look around I hear the streets blocked up\nIt's just like where you say send ya back in a pine box\nI take my shirt off in this bitch, stretch marks and all\nTurn into something, put my back against the wall\nGet to jacking and punching until I break a nigga jaw\nKeep swinging and swinging until my enemy fall\nBiatch!\n\n[Hook: Cousin Fik]\nHe an animal, a beast\nHe don't eat, nigga he feast\nSame jeans for weeks\nOut here with the zombies, fiends and tweaks\n\n[Verse 3]\nMommy and daddy never home so we raised ourselves\nNo dental plan, medical insurance and health\nSo I'm out here with the zombies, dope fiends and tweaks\nBodies in the streets covered with sheets\nUnlicensed drunk drivers, sex offenders in prides\nSupposed to be saved folks, sinners and backsliders\nIt ain't for play, one thing about Los Angeles, San Diego and The Bay\nWe quick to throw it all away in one day\nOver some he-say, she-say\nLock me up and throw the key away, give me L-I-F-E\nGive a fuck, \"I'ma die out here\" became my mentality\nBe a barbarian till I'm old and grey for eternity\nGhetto celebrity, hey, specializing in selling D\nBut right now it's a drought, so I'm selling tree\nZips, zaps, zubbles, peas for three\nThou-wow a pound, nigga holla at me\nBiatch!\n\n[Hook: Cousin Fik]\nHe an animal, a beast\nHe don't eat, nigga he feast\nSame jeans for weeks\nOut here with the zombies, fiends and tweaks"}]}
