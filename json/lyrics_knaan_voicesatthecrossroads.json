At the same time, it's very familiar to a lot of people on the planet. You wanna share with us?\n\n(K'naan)\nMan, that of the displaced peoples. Yeah, that's everywhere. I was born and raised in Mogdishu, Somalia. Um, spent a lot of time here and, you know, around the world traveling doing my music, my word, you know, spoken word and poetry. And that's where I groove, you know, that's how I became a full-on artist is through the word, hip-hop"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
