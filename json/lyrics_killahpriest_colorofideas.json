Courage, heart or a brain?\nRediscover each part, I'll explain\nThe tin man is the working man, he had no heart for retire plans\nThe scarecrow was the Farmers\nY'all know they say southern people had no brains\nWithout them we get no vegetables or grains\nZion was the lion, had no courage\nDorothy and the dog now is now uncovered\n\n[Verse 3: Killah Priest]\nThe origins of the kabbalah\nThe Moors bend before Allah\nThe articles of the merkabah\nGod moves in the aggadah\nBlack Jews salute, Yahawah\nYahweh, Yahuwah\nMy medulla go through futures\nA pearl in the sky\nA cloud in the shape of a shell in the land where Oysters die\nI stood on the beach, I started to cry\nSand shot from eyes, I dive in the ocean to dry\n\n[Verse 4: Killah Priest]\nMemoirs of of tomorrow, a ship lodged in a bottle\nSocieties beneath a sun inside a Earth that's hollow\nFuel burst from Apollo, a crew search for a marble\nThat can give each human the feeling like it hit the lotto\nThe sky fell by the head of a swallow\nA thousand eagles lifted it off it's body\nAnd back to the cosmos, book scrolls and novels\nSubatomic clouds above a conscious crowd\nThat stand on radio actives sand\nHundreds of white garments bow\nBeneath the moon is the barn owl\nLand of the black alien wizards\nAlpha Dracon star human seas, Luciferians and mystics\nPriest the autoraptatrone, the megaspitacron\nThe grand mic holder, the HipHopgrapher niggergon\nMelaninated wars, he elevated from floors\nBack into the light holding a mic\nThrough metal spaceship doors that hover the lake fog\nThe color of ideas Everybody loves the sunshine from Roy Ayers\nPlay em back to back sit back enjoy the spheres"}]}
