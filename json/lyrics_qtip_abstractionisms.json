I'm the (?) for your oppression\nStanding in my rightful place, residing as it seems\nThat it's earthed inside the dark, hopefully you catch the gleam\nYou turn unto the village, you can see how we get tranqued\nSeems to pawn follow pawn, and become the queen's bank\nI'm not part of that, I may be ghetto, spack\nBut I'm too smart to embark into the deadly traps\nNever gettin' (?) although (?) rarely follows\nI pride myself as optimist, but damn this place is hollow\nGuess I better hit the grind, fill my jams taut with substance\nSprinkle vibes around with result and abundance\nFalling prey to categories can be black and abysmal\nDamage to the aura, which encases us like crystal\nThe raising of the bar, is a part of repertoire\nWe gon' edit negatives off this little black noir\n\n[Chorus]\nAbstractionisms, for your daily rhythms/nigga [x3]\n\n[Verse 2]\nPeace everybody, glad I've got your attention\nWe drove the path of ease, and steer clear of pretention\nNow we riding high because the weight inside the trunk\nHas been sifted, with specifics, its been shifted for the junk\nHere's the funk, and the anchor is the bass that make you wiggle\nDon't over-analyze it, it's no need for you to niggle\nI stand inside my power, like a knight inside the court\nEverybody follow suit, if it's rigid don't abort\nIt's heavenly, somebody sound the reveille\nThe day is starting in the rhythm's highest pedigree\nI got the beat reverberating and energy's on 10\nSending sound-waves through orals, I revitalize the den\nOr deep, it's still TM, everybody's got it in them\nDon't hold these words as boring even though you all are snoring\nConstantly restoring cause we living and we breathing\nI'm injected and infected with this premise I'm not leaving"}], "artist": "Q-Tip"}
