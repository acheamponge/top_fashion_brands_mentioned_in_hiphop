So what?\nAll I do is call your name in front of you\nI couldn't stand meeting as friends, No\nI'm going crazy. No I grow crazier. The more I meet you\nMy head gets fuzzy, my heart is confused, I don't know what I'll do either, Yeah\n\nEyes that can't lie, The dream last night that was like a nightmare\nI love it when you look only at me like this, say \"dear\"\n\nIt's my obsession, don't curse me\nThat's my obsession, don't look away\nIt's my obsession\nDon't tell me please, Don't tell me, That's my obsession\nThat's my obsession\n\nIf only I could hold you once\nI wish you were my lover for just a moment\nPlease, please, please I pray\nUs, us, us, us together, together\n\nI'm sorry\nThat night wasn't lonely\nFor some reason there's nothing different to the usual\nBut the spot I prepared so beautifully for you doesn't look that happy\nNot even a word, But it's okay dear\nIt doesn't bother me, I'm happy we're together\nDon't worry anymore\nI'll stay by your side and protect you forever\n\nEyes that can't lie, The dream last night that was like a nightmare\nI don't know what to do if you fall asleep so quietly, Dear open your eyes\n\nIt's my obsession, Don't curse me\nThat's my obsession, Don't turn your back at me\nIt's my obsession\nDon't tell me please, Don't tell me, That's my obsession\nThat's my obsession\n\nIf only I could hold you once\nI wish you were my lover for just a moment\nPlease, please, please I pray\nUs, us, us, us together, together\n\nSmile, please smile, you're prettiest when smiling, Cry? Why am I crying?\nWipe those tears, and you have no expression\nYou stiffen, I bring my knees to the floor, and ask you what you did wrong\n\nEndless expectations, by some possibility\nIf it was all a joke, if someone woke me up\nThis was all my persistence, If only I lessened my greed\nIf I knew I'd live like this as a sinner\n\n1-uno 2-dos 3-tres 4-cuatro\n\nIt's my obsession, Don't curse me\nThat's my obsession, Don't turn your back at me\nIt's my obsession\nDon't tell me please, Don't tell me, That's my obsession\nThat's my obsession\n\nIf only I could hold you once\nI wish you were my lover for just a moment\nPlease, please, please I pray\nUs, us, us, us together, together"}]}
