Cruz, we on our shit\nAnd all these haters they stay fallin' off my (my brother)\nAnd my baby mama, her to\nHermes, got a new purse too\n2 baby mamas, save the drama for somebody who care\nMe I put the pistol to your *mother* fuckin' hair\nYou know me, you know I'm straight outta Compton\nSome call it Bompton, tell 'em \"Stay all the way up\"\nDon't matter if it's ese wit Blood\nI got somethin', I'm in the strip club, makin' it rain\nAll these other rappers out here tryin' to make a game\nI'm takin chains, and you heard about it\nYou gon' read about it\nI'm in AOD, come and see about it\nThrowin' money in the air\nSoon as it hit the ground, I get a new wad and\nThrow it all the way up\nYeah, I throw it all the way up\nDrinking Ciroc 'til I throw all the way up\nWest side in the air, put it all the way up\nYeah, breakfast bars and we out"}]}
