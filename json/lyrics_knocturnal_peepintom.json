(Fuck the police)\nFuck being bound by law and the peace treaty\nWe be clubbin, everybody likes when the girls shake somethin\nSystem overload, stay bumpin\nIt's thug life, y'all know the rules, gotta do what ya gotta do, and stay true\nPropose a toast to the West Coast\nEasily I approach the microphone because I ain't no joke\nTell your mama to get off of my dip\nI have no time to give her my dick, I'm gonna hold it\nAnd walk around the stage\nAnd if you fuck up, I'm gonna get my gauge and shrivel you up\nLike California raisins, then unload the barrell and laugh\n'Cause I'm puttin lead in your motherfuckin' ass\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm on the radio, and ain't a damn thing funny\nIt's just like Compton, bitch better have my money\nI messed up and I don't know why\nTryin' to get a piece of that American Pie\nDo my thing, blow off the roof on 187-Proof\nIt's gettin funk-ay, it's gettin funk-ay\nIt's the formula, murder was the case that they gave me\nDear God, I wonder can you save me?\nDear Mama, Brenda had a baby\nHard times got a nigga goin' crazy\nThe hood can't take me under, it's a G-thang\nWe backyard bullyin' in the land where we bang\nGangsta's make the world go 'round\nWhat's my motherfuckin' name?\nKnoc-Turn'al, didn't even have to use my AK\nToday was a good day"}]}
