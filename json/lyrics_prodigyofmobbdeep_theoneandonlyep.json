You might wanna cry\nHe got a problem with P? He might wanna die\nWhile I'm, so lovable and so humble\nThat if you cross me, then you deserve to stumble\nAnd fall on a Rambo knife\nLook homey, you obviously don't know me, I'm\n\n[Chorus: repeat 4X]\nThe one and only, Infamous, notorious\n[Prodigy]\nI'm Bandana P, the fantastic one\nReptile, I spit acid, they kyan't done\nI die harder than your average die hardheaded nigga\nI don't learn 'til it's too late, and it's early nigga\nI don't take orders, fold, or break under pressure\nI don't take kindly to strangers or new faces\nIt might be the police\nMaybe the D.A. brothers, come to get me\n... I've got a dark sense of humor\nGotta calm down a lot, I, got a hot temper\n... I'm tryin to change\nBut these people out here push me to engage\nIn all types of fuckery, jealous and they envious\nMisery love company they don't really love me~!\nI had to sever our ties\nSit back in my jacuzzi watchin pelicans fly\nThinkin back how we used to be on the same page\nI realize now, that you nothin like me, I'm\n\n[Chorus]\n[Prodigy]\nMy reign at the top don't stop, it's endless\nWatch me crush so-called competition, man listen\nThere is no threat to my position\nThese niggas is harmless, there's no comparison, to\nRap's top shotter, best sellin author\nIn non-fiction, you better pray I go easy\nAnd thank me for not exposin your bumba claat\nI could go in on you, but I'm not\nSuccess is the best revenge\nAnd I'm fit to show you people how to do this here\nIntelligent, smooth criminal music\nYou never lived this life, you can't relate to it\nI'm the chief of all chiefs, the Don of all dons\nThe boss of all bosses, the fuckin warlord\nThe grand wizard of bars\nWhen I die, my tombstone'll read \"He was...\"\n\n[Chorus]", "year": null}]}
