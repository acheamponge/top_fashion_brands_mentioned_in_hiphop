I've been had\nI've become best friends with a pen and pad\nUnderstanding the logic of an inanimate object\nStanding in the projects with a sign around my neck\nSaying \"Show me my respect!\"\nThey thought it as a setup, upset\nI've been unusual\nI've been an unusual suspect\nYou're beautiful, just check\nTo make sure that you're musical on set\nI'll be back in a minute\nReact to the limit\nAnd find out if ya act offended\nAsking me if you can kick it?\nI said \"No you may not.\"\nCause your flow just ain't hot\nSo you busters stay shy\nWhat the fuck do they got?\nWatch your mouth. What'd that bitch say?\nThat went way out\nNo doubt hit by the ricochet\nKids today. I just don't trust em\nWhen I have mine I'm a make him speak in rhymes\nHe'll think that it's custom\nI'll tell him that he's Muslim every Christmas\nSo on December 25th he'll be giftless\nThen I'll convince this dumbass\nHe's actually a witness of Jehovah\nFlip mat sheets on the sofa\nHave him bring fat chicks on over\nGive em drinks if they're sober\nWe'll make some noise soon\nIf she stinks up an odor\nSend it to my boys room\nThis is my house\nYou don't like it you can get the fuck out\nCause under my roof, you live by my rules, son\nI make you want to bounce\n\nSage Francis makes you wanna bounce\nJoey Beats makes you wanna bounce\nNon-Prophets weathered and deep cuts\nWe send battle rhymes to shatter minds\nThe Secret Service Crew\nBut they'll all fall through\nNon-Prophets\nIf you're jumping up and down right now\nStop it\n\nI've made a man mad\nI've been a mad man\nI've been a goody two shoes\nWho walks bare footed in a bad land\nI've been to Madison\n\"What's up?\" to my Boston heads\nI came to visit y'all\nBut you know me I got lost instead\nI toss in bed\nKeep myself awake at night\nWorried that I might not fall asleep\nUntil I see the light\nMy friends wanna see me fight\nCause I'm a Black Belt Karate Master!\nI'd rather have my freestyle raps\nSale the party's laughter\nPlus I'm out of shape\nAnd haven't trained in months\nCan't count how many times\nMy face has been punched\nI'm feeling cranial lumps\nThey made you a chump\nI left you walkin a course of\nMind anguish with sign language\nIs y'all def or what?\nThat depends. You mean the d-e-a-f kind?\nHe must've read my lips so hard\nThat he was left blind\nI've never been signed\nBut I've been signed off\nCause I never rhyme soft\nOr wore designed cloth\nEvery time I cough\nI swear to God that it's a cardiac arrest\nFeel my chest\nMake sure it's not a heart attack\nI'm stressed\nIt's rest that I probably lack\nYes. I'm a full fledged\nOver the edge hypochondriac obsessed\nWith cleaning the rims on my Pontiac\nRollin through the plaza asking\n\"where tha party at?\"\nCome in hardly last\nBut hardly fat\nBuying oil in Iraq\nTo get him violent\nAnd his car keys back\nMy wife don't want me back\nI want to hold her\nIt's a shame she ain't been the same\nEver since I told her\n\"This is my house\nYou don't like it, you can get the fuck out\nThis is my roof, you live by my rules bitch.\"\nShe said I had to bounce\n\nSage Francis makes you wanna bounce\nJoey Beats makes you wanna bounce\nNon-Prophets weathered and deep cuts\nWe send battle rhymes to shatter minds\nThe Secret Service Crew\nBut them all fall through\nNon-Prophets\nIf you're jumping up and down right now\nYou missed the topic", "album": null}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
