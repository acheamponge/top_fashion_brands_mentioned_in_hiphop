At the mall, everyday when we was ditchin'\nYou ain't got no pen and paper\nWe know you ain't got no bitches\nNigga, you ain't got no bitches\nMy nigga, you ain't got no bitches\nIf you beefin', where yo girl? Shit, I know she wit the business\nI go flip it, you know how niggas did it\nAnd plus, I'm immature so the whole school know I did it\nOh, shit, I shit, I'm such a west side nigga\nIf I neva met yo girl, then you blessed my nigga\nScrollin' thru my aim, tryna see who wanna kick it\nHit 'em all like I can get it, I ain't thirsty, I'm just wid it\nI ain't thirsty, I'm just wid it\nI ain't thirsty, I'm just wid it\nChillin with the homies, lookin' for the bitches\nHit 'em all like we can get it\nI ain't thirsty, I'm just wid it\nI ain't thirsty, I'm just wid it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/967988d72ade953e4d1121eb78757aa7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}]}
