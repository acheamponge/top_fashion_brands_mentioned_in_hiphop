I'm fighting with a flatfooted felon\nFive Falcons just flew to a fountain and fell in\nGoogling, googly-eyed girls to get inside\nGolly gee from Glasgow to Guatemala's gentrified\nA hippopotamus is high on heroin he heckles me\nAnd hires Haitian Hank to hand his ho a hysterectomy\nIn hateful hieroglyph, I hurl-out hyperbolic hubris\nAnd hang with Hipster Helen that's the hooker with the huge hips\nI'm ill, I'm Icarus, I ignite idiots in idioms and issues\nJumpy jargon I joust like Jacare jivin' Japanese Judo and Jiujitsu\nKillin' em like a kid.. got a Kilogram of Ketamine for Kwanza\nKnit a Kimono made of Komodo Dragon skin\nI'm rich like a Klingon that be kicking it at the Kremlin\nBut I'm kicking through your door, call me Kramer Kardashian\nLethal, Literally litter a little limerick\nThat be littler than a Leprechaun\nA menace that'll manifest the melancholy mayhem\nMakin a metamorphosis until I'm mechanized like Megatron\nNick Nolte: a nerdy native of Nebraska\nNeeds a neon ninja and a nectarine from NASA\nOminously, I mean it's obvious you see a:\nOrthodontist oozing out oodles of onomatopoeias\nOswalt: Patton\nPickin a pocket pluckin' a patent\nI pickle purple poop in Patron for pure passion\nI got a question, I gotta quiz ya'\nLet's step on the gas and go quicker\nReally getting ready for the revolution\nReeled a rotten rhythm ring around a Russia Ronda Rousey resort\nServe a simple sentiment a simile that's smokin'\nLike a sheet of Sudafed, I'm swiftly swimming like a seahorse\nTitties on Atilla Tell a teller that'll toe tag\nTerminator gun inside a turtle tattered tote bag\nThugs are un-American unattractive and unwanted as an ugly pair of ugg's\nVivid and vivaciously venomous\nWith the wicked wombats only walking where women is\nGettin xenophobic at the Xanadu\nXoXo\nYippy-ki-yay\nYours truly, Mac\nYes yo!\n\nOh shit, I forgot Z\nZebra", "year": "2014-02-19", "album": "YouTube", "title": "Alphabet Insanity"}], "artist": "Mac Lethal"}
