He went out there and hustled and grinded. Everything happens for a reason; the universe comes back around, that\u2019s how it go.\n\n\nOn the Grammys snubbing him entirely\n\nI definitely feel like they should always have more of the culture up in there, for sure, because we definitely stand out just like any other genre. We part of the world. We part of the movement. So I think any awards, including the Grammys, should always push for more hip-hop because it\u2019s music as a whole, it\u2019s not just splitting different regions. Everything moves as far as sound and vibrations, and that\u2019s how it goes. And we are a part of that."}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
