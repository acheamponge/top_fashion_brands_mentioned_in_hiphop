If I had some crack, I would be smoking it, I use drugs, I don't sell no drugs\nOkay, so we gon' take this little 30 dollars then book it into evidence\nWe ain't got to do that, brother! I sit down and told you I ain't sold that man no crack, I don't know where he brought that crack from!\nI had them same 30 dollars that I had when I walked over there, 'cause I'm goin' in my pockets to get my money out and make sure I had change to use the phone!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d490a9246c93be0a14dc0d13699d97a2.908x908x1.jpg", "year": "2010-07-06", "title": "Be Still", "album": "Sir Lucious Left Foot...
