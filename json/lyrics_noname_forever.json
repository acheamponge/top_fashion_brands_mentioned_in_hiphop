To marry the sunset\nIf it ain't us yet forever\n\n[Verse 2: Noname]\nI sold my name for seven bags of Skittles on Sunnyset Boulevard\nPlease tell me God is rainbow pretty\nMystery and fully charged\nNobody understands my songs\nAloe vera sentences to heals the scars\nOf rental cars to Malibu to Shangri-La\nOoh, my cigarette burning, my momma be calling\nShe worry about me, her girl alcoholic\nAnd I can take a trip to L.A\nAnd I can lose myself inside myself\nI hope the Lord forgive me now\nWhy I still be thrifting, accustomed to wearing hand-me-downs\nWhy my Cinderella a cinder block for my family now\nI can't build no mansion on top of these shaggy bones\nI left my home I'm on, the road forgive me\nThere she go again, her dark consumerism\nAssimilated in him, cash the new gospel\nOccupational sin, just walked out of the church house\nWith happy all in my pocket, a little something to spend\n\n[Chorus: Noname & Ravyn Lenae]\nThey ain't tryna' to see me shine, shine\nBullet on my time, time, but fuck it, I'll live forever\nThey ain't trying to see us shine, shine\nBullet on our time, time, but fuck it, we'll live forever\nForever in a day\nFollow in the rain, you know that we live forever\nHow long will it take? To marry the sunset\nIf it ain't us yet forever\n\n[Verse 3: Joseph Chilliams]\nWe gon' live forever like Aaliyah; look how they did Rekia\nHonestly I'm just happy I can be here\nHoping I don't offend all my peers\nWhen I say that ass is a mouthful like kujichagulia\nFollowing bright ideas, 'cause I'm a victim to colorism\nThey flood the prison, no difference hanging from trees\nWhen they gon' leave the system I notice we still ain't free\nIn this club trying to ban me 'cause my white tee\nI mean like high key, I was chosen to fight in a pair of Mikes\nOver polite holding a knife\nThey hold my life in low regards hoping I'm hopeless\nBut I've been in love for so long like Janet Jackson\nPoems, I know I'm terrible but I'm focused like a variable\nEmitting pheromones so I don't got to bear it alone\nNina Simone biopic made me swear at my home\nGotta call someone so I can tell them on my telefone\n\n[Chorus: Noname & Ravyn Lenae]\nThey ain't tryna' to see me shine, shine\nBullet on my time, time, but fuck it, I'll live forever\nThey ain't trying to see us shine, shine\nBullet on our time, time, but fuck it, we'll live forever\nForever in a day\nFollow in the rain, you know that we live forever\nHow long will it take? To marry the sunset\nIf it ain't us yet forever"}], "artist": "Noname"}
