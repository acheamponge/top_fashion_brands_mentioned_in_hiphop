Blue Angels, Blue Angels, Blue Angels!\n\n[Verse 1:Pras]\nYo, yo, yo\nYo it's the ghetto diplo', bridgin like the Tri-Boro\nVictory is endless cause we all want a hero\nBlazing Saddles so stop horsing around\nFrom sunup to sundown, it's the world renowned\nIt's hard to be real when them cats are make believe\nStop it please, come run wit deez\nIf you can't feel me, then get up and leave\nCause I'm automated life flyin, Fate is on her knees\nLocate the object, pinpoint my movin target\nPray for them, and bless em, like Sister Margaret\nGot more alumni than the grad school of Harvard\nBeat Street the movie was my all time favorite\nSo can you stand the smell of a black powder\nMy B.I. is 700, horsepower\nBurnin rubber, break you off somethin proper\nLove it or not, I'm the man of the hour, yeah\n\n[Chorus: The Product G&B]\nJust when you thought my shine was burnin out\nThem cats were down and out, in the heat of the night\nThere ain't no problems baby we can't get through\nYou gotta believe in me, and I'll believe in you\nUhhh! Blue Angels, Blue Angels, Blue Angels!\n\n[Verse 2: Pras]\nYo yo, yo, yo\nYo she was hot to death, like the story Macbeth\nWhen your marked for death it's a matter of life or death\nI'ma cherish and nourish every single breath\nWhen there's no one left, I'ma carry your footprints\nStep by step, walkin through the, twentieth\nCentury, eyes on me\nWhen the dogs start barkin you must set them free\nGo in between the sheets just like the Isley's\nI'ma kill em precisely, indirectly\nChoose my women wisely, Charlie's Angels got my back\nAs if I was Bosley, bout to get rowdy\nSo pray to Mother Mary, you think this is easy?\nBe a cold day in Hell before I let you come and get me\nSo stop actin frowsy, that's the one-fifty\nHoller if you hear me make your move if you ready\nDirty Cash, Navy Seals, reppin through your city, what?\n\n[Chorus The Product G&B]\nJust when you thought my shine was burnin out\nThem cats were down and out, in the heat of the night\nThere ain't no problems baby we can't get through\nYou gotta believe in me, and I'll believe in you\nUhhh! Blue Angels, Blue Angels, Blue Angels!\n\n[Verse 3: Pras]\nYo yeah, yo, yo\nHey yo the way I feel now you cats can drop dead\nJump up and spread then take off them threads\nYou heard what I said, don't be misled\nNavy Seals what?  Running over chickenheads\nRun like I'm a caca, act like a bobaka\nMy ears shoot the street, just to take out the impostor\nTomorrow never dies when she reveals her eyes\nKeep your eyes on the prize, for Pras is the prize\nTough guys get penalized, cut down to size\nIt's the one that be witchu that be the true spies\nNever say never when we can make it together\nRefugees are tougher than ever, what?\n\n[Chorus: The Product G&B]\nJust when you thought my shine was burnin out\nThem cats were down and out, in the heat of the night\nThere ain't no problems baby we can't get through\nYou gotta believe in me, and I'll believe in you\nUhhh! Blue Angels, Blue Angels, Blue Angels! (Blue Angels)\n\n(Got to do or die)\nJust when you thought my shine was burnin out\nThem cats were down and out, in the heat of the night\nThere ain't no problems baby we can't get through\nYou gotta believe in me, and I'll believe in you\nUhhh! Blue Angels, Blue Angels, Blue Angels!", "year": "1998-09-28"}]}
