Night Shyamalan\nThem people searchin' for somethin' with body armor on\nYou never know who they wantin', that\u2019s why we on the law\nPreparin' me, that isn\u2019t necessary, what I'm haunted by is knowin' where the bodies are buried\nYet, I'm taunted by the omen\nKnowin' my adversary, I'm gone to Neveruary\nIt\u2019s on, it\u2019s gettin' heavy for real"}], "artist": "Black Thought"}
