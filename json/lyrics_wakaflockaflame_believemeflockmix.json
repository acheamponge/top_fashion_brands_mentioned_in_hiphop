Cuz a nigga stay winning\nAll them cars and the cribs, a home and they ain't rented\nI should feel bad for 'em truthfully, this the motherfuckin rap game, who do you believe?\nI told 'em when I started only option is shootin me, or salutin me, I'm still here and the crew with me\nCold day in hell before someone get the best of me\nI be at the lake house, wildin' on some jet skis\nDaddy back run along do your chores mane\nBricksquad Monopoly is not a fuckin' board game\n\n\n[Hook] x2\nI'm the only one that get the job done\nI'm payin nobody, shoot my own gun", "image": "https://images.genius.com/615016a72f645e322ab9388f4cca0404.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "I Can\u2019t Rap Vol. 1", "title": "Believe Me (Flockmix)"}]}
