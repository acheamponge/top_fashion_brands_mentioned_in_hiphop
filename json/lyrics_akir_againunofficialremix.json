I want you to finish school.  \u2018Cause without an education, the only kind of work you\u2019re gonna get is selling drugs, pimping women, or working security for Eddie Murphy.  Now, I\u2019ve done all I can.  I got my education, I worked two jobs to support you.  But I can\u2019t teach you how to be a man.  Now, give me a kiss and be a good boy\n\n[Akir]\nAgain?  Big shout to John Legend.  It\u2019s Akir.  We dedicate this to everybody with they eyes on the prize\n[Statik Selektah]\nStatik Selektah, Akir.  It\u2019s \u201cThe Secret.\u201d\n\n[Verse 1 \u2013 Akir]\nSong-writing again\nGotta show the industry I\u2019m nice, lightning when I strike with the pen\nBlao!  Getting older.  Just got sober.  But I\u2019m drinking again\nAnd we performing at ten.  And if she caught it to then\nHope I don\u2019t fuck up my rhymes again\nI got over.  Shit, I\u2019m a soldier\nI freestyle mean styles until the end\nBut I\u2019m tired of performing the same shit\nI had to get back on the street\u2014the hustler\u2019s language\nAnd though I thought [?] time, my lane switch\nFree shows, gotta eat mo\u2019 the same shit\nPromoting, still faking\nI\u2019m getting much love from my fam\nBut those close to the grams\nBroke while they shaking my hand\nSo I explain who I am\nThey don\u2019t give a fuck\nOnly shorty\u2019s hitting me up\nI wanna quit the nicotine, but\nI light \u2018em up again (light \u2018em up)\nAnd make progress to show change\nBut thug niggas go hard to the cage\nMy OG of old age\nComplaining of wage.  Go back to old ways\nAlmost as slaves\nI never, ever wanna have to say: goodbye\n\n[Verse 2 \u2013 John Legend]\nSo I\u2019ve got a new friend\nI wish I could forget you but I miss you, wanna kiss you again\nBut she\u2019s like you\nBut she not you\nGotta find you again\nWe remember again\nThe middle of the summer and I take you out to dinner again\nBoy, I love her\nIt\u2019s not over\n\u2018Cause I love her again", "year": "2009-10-28", "album": "The Secret", "image": "https://images.genius.com/69cdf875f4c2405e3ab5b52878542f48.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "AKIR"}
