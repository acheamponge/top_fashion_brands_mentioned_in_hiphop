I wish that i could get pregnant with ava gardners children\nInstead im doin the twirl, as i watch text messages ruin the world\nAnd technology period\nIm waitin for the day we can all burn copies of eachothers girlfriends and skip the technology period\nCause Aunt Flow's an old fashioned gal, and computer love just ain't her style (gross)\nLordy Lou all I wanna do is make it til I'm 42 so I can feel just in every grouchy thing I say or do\nUntil then you better watch out for that tailspin\nNo I'm not a rapper I'm a used car salesman", "year": null, "album": "The Love Potion Collection 4", "title": "Rotten Apple Pie"}], "artist": "Mac Lethal"}
