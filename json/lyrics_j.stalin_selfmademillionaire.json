Stalin]\nThey keep hating but let 'em cause I'm staying strapped\nNigga throw 2 at me I'ma throw 30 back\nWhere I live at niggas chasing pipe dreams\nIf you ain't' selling then you using the cream\nMartin had a dream, Malcolm had a 1,000 men\nMe I'm just a poor sport so nigga I just gotta win\nAnd no I ain't never been to the pen\nBut I send a nigga shells that'll burn the skin\nLet your ass heal up and shoot ya ass again\nI'm cut from the cloth\nYour money thinner than a moth\nBitch I'm just a boss, get it all off\nThrow it in the bag and never look at the cost\nAsk me why I floss, tell 'em cause I'm supposed to\nIf you was me you'd be riding round shining too\nI'm on my grind, and I ain't never gettin' off\nSo don't wait, cause I just popped another off\nWinner in the game of life, but some niggas lost\nFuck them crackas making niggas spread and cough\nIf I can't get to my banga I'ma wire ya jaw\nProduct of the shit I learned, the shit I saw\nStill got it raw, first come first serve\nHomie I'm a getta, I move the whole bird\nFinna blow like twitter, rest of you niggas nerds\nI'm a go getta on top of that I'm a hitta\nYou can have that lil bitch\nWhen the gangsta finish with her\nI'm a tell you the truth, nigga that's my word\nI could get it back, cause I get it off the curb\n\n[Hook: L'Jay]\nI'm a self made millionaire\nI can feel it coming in the air\nThis for my niggas thats gone away\nThough I swear I keep a K in your memory\nThough I swear I keep a K in your memory\nThough I swear I keep a K in your memory\nThough I swear I keep a K in your memory\nThough I swear I keep a K in your memory\nLet this drum off\nBet these niggas gone remember me\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Retro]\nIn the diamond lane and I'm driving drinking hennessy\nStopped selling cream but the fiends still remember me\nFeeling like a dream, with them things in my kitchen sink\nLiving like a king, triple beam, ya I'm finna eat\nStreet nigga 100 racks for the energy\nMoney to the ceiling got from boogie bitches feeling me\nLook him in his eyes ya them boosie niggas envy me\nFans in disguise but the truth those niggas into me\nSuckas thinking I'm a square but I'm 2 peace\nMy West Oakland niggas knock your ass down for 2 g's\nPay attention to us show you how to do things\nReal street niggas balling like a hoop team\nBending corners on them bitches looking too clean\nMy livewire niggas ride around with 2 things\nCatch a nigga slipping and we lacing up with shoestrings\nAnybody can get it, smother whoever you bring\n\n[Hook: L'Jay]\nI'm a self made millionaire\nI can feel it coming in the air\nThis for my niggas thats gone away\nThough I swear I keep a K in your memory\nThough I swear I keep a K in your memory\nThough I swear I keep a K in your memory\nThough I swear I keep a K in your memory\nThough I swear I keep a K in your memory\nLet this drum off\nBet these niggas gone remember me\n\n[Verse 3: J. Stalin]\nI done sold dope\nI have done bad\nI was on ? with a choppa and a ski mask\nIn the trap with the gangstas bustin' down cream\nSee I'm a hustla, so I'm not his pipe dream\nFuck what they told you, everything ain't what it might seem\nGoin' to school bummed me because my momma was a crack feind\nSo I said fuck it, copped a bundle thang in my jeans\nMade man nigga, fuck niggas ain't feeling me\nCatch a nigga slippin' light his ass like a chimney\nFuck about you niggas cause you pussies ain't killin' me\nO.G. told me get money and stick to it\nAnd don't let your left know what your right doin'\nMoney motivated nigga so I chased that\nPaper to your daughter make 'em take me where the safe at\nNow believe that the bank shoot thirty three\nLet the whole clip off you niggas gone remember me\nCan't believe that the bank shoot thirty three\nLet the whole clip off you niggas gone remember me\n\n[Hook: L'Jay]\nI'm a self made millionaire\nI can feel it coming in the air\nThis for my niggas thats gone away\nThough I swear I keep a K in your memory\nThough I swear I keep a K in your memory\nThough I swear I keep a K in your memory\nThough I swear I keep a K in your memory\nThough I swear I keep a K in your memory\nLet this drum off\nBet these niggas gone remember me"}], "artist": "J.
