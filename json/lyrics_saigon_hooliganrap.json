It\u2019s hooligan raps (Haha).  Niggas is (It\u2019s hooligan raps) out here at 7:30, thinking you could fuck with me, nigga (It\u2019s hooligan rap).  You fucking niggas can\u2019t rhyme, nigga (It\u2019s hooligan rap)\n\n[Verse 1: Saigon]\nAyyo, I\u2019m powerful.  I shower you Power-U\u2019s with a Calico\nYou could know how it feel to have a slug in your clavicle\nAnd I ain\u2019t even mad at you.  I just like making\nAny tragedy more tragical.  It sounds sick but it\u2019s actual\nThirty-five thousand and forty hours of watching cowards\nGet killed in the showers.  Blood clump like milk when it sours\nI\u2019ve even seen grown men that broke home-zoning\nBrother where his mother of his kids was home boning\nThe same cat that caught him and the cat phone-jonesing\nFinally hung up\u2014they found him at four in the morning\nNothing your queer crew do could compare to\nThe shit that I had to bear through.  I ain\u2019t trying to hear you\nYou never was a Glock slinger, pop singer\nRun this or you gon\u2019 tongue-kiss this mop wringer\nYou niggas better get low \u2018cause Saigon is destined to blow\nIf not, I\u2019ma get locked for unlocking and letting it go\nProfessional flow, spit unquestionable\nTold you I\u2019d make you a vegetable\n\n[Interlude: Saigon]\nYo, that\u2019s crazy (Yo, yo, hooligan rap).  What else you got, though?  That\u2019s all you got (What\u2019s that, man?).  Take that shit, nigga\n\n[Verse 2: Saigon]\nI said: here I am twenty long years since my child birth as\nStill remember the nurses who said I\u2019d grow to be worthless\nOne said, \u201cLook it.  Another youngin born a sinner\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t say, \u201cYoungin,\u201d though, yo.  You know she used the n-word\nI looked at the bitch.  Was only here for a minute\nThe bitch looked back grinning.  I know when I\u2019m comprehending this shit\nAll the noise in the nebulizer was hard to listen\nBut when she went to pick me up, yep, I started pissing (Take that)\nBut ever since benevolence wasn\u2019t in the frame of my thought\nI became shorts who kept his moms in and out of the courts\nActually, man had bigger mans to fracture me\nFigured he creep, rock me to sleep, come and capture me\nBut naturally I caught on.  Thinking I\u2019m sneaking but, see, I thought wrong\nThey placed in juvie somewhere near Hawthorne\nWasn\u2019t my turn to burn.  That only made me more lethal\n\n[Outro: Saigon]\nNah, nah, nah, listen, fat man.  Don\u2019t even do it like that, nigga", "album": "Saigon A.K.A.
