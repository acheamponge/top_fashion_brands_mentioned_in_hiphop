HO!!\nHe go by the name of Kardinal niggas!\n\n[Kardinal Offishall]\nL-l-l-l-l-looky here here\nLook who fronted and snuck in the rear rear\nImported like a Red Stripe beer beer\nThese clowns ain't showing nothing but tear tear tears\nYup for years I been on the pier\nWatching everything pass by but still no fear fear fear\nNah judge not, man a grudge to bloodclaat\nMi no watch dat mi back out the back back back\nTo the frontline, want mine NOPE!\nI'm classic like an old hollowed out rope chain\nIt's me Kardinal, Black Jays on it now\nNuff respect but from you? I don't want it now\nCheah!!\n\nHO!! Bring the fire out!! [8x]\n\n[Kardinal]\nB-b-b-b-b-but wait\nIf you put me in a box I would suf-fu-cate\nHow I dance with the dancehall and hop with the hipsters\nT Dot to the middle of Chi-town like Twista\nUsed to have a backpack on like Kanye\nThen I dipped to the platinum now the words pay\nShout out to B, Lamont, the whole LA\nStill rock the uptowns in Saint-Tropez\nCause I M-I (AYY!!) just over in M-I (AYY!)\nWith a chick like M-I (AYY!!)\nUK to the (AYY!!) I move with the best\nAnd we rock everything nothing more nothing less like\n\nHO!! Bring the fire out!! [8x]\n\n[Kardinal]\nY-y-y-yes it's real\nI came to let it out nothing is concealed\nIf the +Price Is Right+ better spin that wheel\nAnd hope you got enough O's to get that deal\nI'm an electrical attitude north of ya latitude\nDid it on my own so keep your fake gratitude\nBig problems I can't stay mad at you\nHomegirl I got a lot of chicks that's bad as you\nNow the world is my playpen\nGirlies tryna get a touch NOPE! I'm taken\nTryna get my time I'm too busy caking\nTryna get it in Canadian-Jamaican UHH!!\n\nHO!! Bring the fire out!! [8x]\n\nHO!! HO!! HO!! HO!! [until fade]"}], "artist": "Kardinal Offishall"}
