I ain't gon' stop grindin'\nViolate me if ya want gon' have to come find me\nLookin' for me in the streets I'm somewhere shinin'\nLive every gotdamn day like it's Friday\nDamn my P.O. I ain't gon' stop grindin'\nViolate me if ya want gon' have to come find me\nLookin' for me in the streets I'm somewhere shinin'\nLive every gotdamn day like it's Friday\n\n[Verse 1]\nTell the feds if they comin' they better come now\nThey got my chips straight now I'm ready to retire\nI ball 'til I fall homie thug 'til I die\nAnd if I died today I know I'll probably fry\nBut if I hit the right lick I can live nice\nThink I'm scared to go get it you gotdamn lie\nMy money go to lookin' funny I'm gettin' on seventy-five\nNon-stop homie straight to the Cuban's island\nI like to get money, fuck hoes, and rock ice\nGive a damn who don't like it, it's my life\nThat's why I drank e'eryday dog and stay high\nCatch me in the strip club lettin' money fly\nAnd goin' broke the only thing that can make me cry\nI told my P.O. she can't change me don't even try\nThe street life got me gone I don't know why\nTryna at least see a couple mill' 'fore I die\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nBefore I went to sleep I prayed for a hundred squares\nTold God he'll bless me if He really cared\nKnow you fuck niggas prayin' for me to get killed\nKnow you crackers wish you could give me a hundred years\nThat's why I ball and stunt for the niggas in jail\nCracker gon' have to kill me 'fore they put me in a cell\nNigga told me to turn myself in I told him \"go to Hell\"\nCause if they want me they better do they job and that's real\nWorst thang they can do is hold me with no bail\nUntil that shit happen been done ran across a whole mill'\nI thug it out 'til the end homie that's how it is\nLife too motherfuckin' short for me to sit still\nI can't leave these streets nigga they pay my bills\nI gotta be dead in prison nigga for me to chill\nI asked a jit the other day why he pop pills\nHe told me I'll pop 'em too if I knew how it feel\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wake up e'ery mornin' lookin' for a money bag\nWhen a nigga died and he was broke then he died sad\nIf I was on my dick you niggas'll be glad\nSqueeze eights on the donk just to make you mad\n'Long as my heart still beatin' nigga I'mma get cash\nLive every motherfuckin' day like it's my last\nIndictment money in my pocket and 'Gnac in my system\nNeed every muhfuckin' day to feel like Christmas\nHeard the crackers downtown givin' out big nimbles\nI know some motherfuckin' Haitians givin' out tickles\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2007-08-07"}]}
