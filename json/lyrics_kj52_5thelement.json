The one that gets laced tight\nThe one you wear, hit a flare on the same night\nThat you hit an uprock, I'm the one in the closet next to one sock\nThe one you rock on the cardboard box\nWalking to the one block\nYou know the one spot peeps get the one shot\nGot one thought on the task at hand\nYou can ask your man I'm part of master plan\nOnly b-boys and b-girls, they understand\nWhatever you say now, ya wish is my command\nName it, I'll be the footwork to your head spin\nFollow your lead, go anyplace that ya legs bend\nAt ya cipher session I'm ya best friend\nI got a twin, we's a pair clocking size 10\nHead's a shell, three stripes on side\nLaces large, on your feets I reside\nKeep me clean, keep me laced, and I'll be allright\nI be the first element up in here tonight\n\nWho am I? See, I'm the one that you be gripping tight\nThe one that makes you sound real good when you be flipping right\nAnd I'm the one causing fights up at the open mic\nI'll make ya sound real stupid if you don't hold me right\nI got emcees fiending for me all day and night\nI could care less if ya on me if ya black or white\nSee all that matters when you rock me don't be coming wack and\nDon't hold me to the speaker or I'ma feedback and\nI'm used for rapping, every now and the used for passng\nBack and forth in ya crew in a freestyle fashion\nI get rocked, ripped, flipped on and blasted\nI'm spoke on, choke on, hit on, spit on, and mastered\nI've outlasted, been used to tell truth and lies\nUsed to kill the youth and used to open up they eyes\nI come in all kinds of sizes, heard all kinds of voices\nSometimes I'm plugged in, you know sometimes I'm cordless\nKeep me clear, keep me close, and I'll be allright\nSee I'm the second element up in here tonight\n\nWho am I? I got two heads and they always spinning\nI got two arms that the deejays, they use for ripping\nPlus a fader in my middle that they always gripping\nI'm completed with the two records used for mixing\nThey pulling tricks and cutting up, ya know they scratching\nRemixing beat, juggling just whie they mix and match and\nAll kinds of beats till it's the heat that I know ya catching\nAnd I'm the one that started hip-hop in case ya asking\nI got knobs and faders in a mad abundance\nI come in many names, but most time it's 1200\nWhen I get played now, you know that you truly love it\nNow clean the needle on my arm or I'll be sounding busted\nI'm disregarded, treated like I ain't legitimate\nI'm making music, you don't see me as an instrument\nAnd it takes true skills to get on me and be ripping it\nNobody sees my contribution, they ain't getting it\nYou know there's one thing that really now makes me mad\nYou used to blow me off but now I'm the latest fad\nI'm the thing that every rock band they got's to have\nNow people say my name and they be like \"Now what is that?\"\nKeep me running, keep me spinning, and I'll be allright\nI'll be the third element up in here tonight\n\nWho am I? Se I'm hiding in your backpack\nYou tear my tip off, replace it with a fat cap\nI'm 12 oz. of steel concealed in a knapsack\nYa pull me out, ya shake me up, and then attack that\nWall or train while ya steady throwing up your name\nLeaving these end to end burners, ya getting ghetto fame\nNow me and my brothers, ya know we come in many colors\nSteady beautifying the walls of a ghetto culture\nToys and suckers now you know they getting dissed quick\nI'm going all city all up in ya district\nYa hold me with control so I never drip thick\nI'm tagging up ya spot, nobody misses it\nSee I'm the brush to a modern day type DiVinci\nI'm the new urban renewal for ya block's committee\nI've spoken words of the youth of an inner city\nI'm vandalism but to others I'll be called graffiti\nKeep me shaking, keep me spraying, and I'll be allright\nI be the fourth element up in here tonight\n\nWho am I? See I'm the God that you don't know about\nI gave you breath up in your lungs that you can't go without\nSee you know the facts of My story you been told about\nI'm always reaching out for you but you just keep on holding out\nI know your doubts, I know you're thinking that I ain't real\nSee I know you forgot about Me when you got ya last record deal\nSee I know the way you feel, I walked the earth just like you\nAnd like a child up in his Father's arms, I long to hide you\nMany times I invite you while standing here right besides you\nBut you walk right past, you ignore My hands here given to guide you\nI gave you gifts, I gave you talents that you just used to gain your wealth\nBut you took my gifts and talents only for you, just to glorify yourself\nI was beaten and bruised, crushed now for your iniquity\nStripped naked, I was spit upon just for you to live eternally\nYet you blaspheme Me, you make moves without asking Me\nThen you blame Me for your troubles and calamities, you kidding me?\nKeep Me first, keep Me in your life, and it's gonna be all right\nSee I'm Jesus Christ, the Fifth Element up in here tonight"}]}
