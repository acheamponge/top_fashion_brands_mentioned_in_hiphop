We\u2019re fighting wars overseas and we\u2019re still losing soldiers at home.  Check\n\n[Verse 1: AKIR]\nSome nigga beat it up.  Shorty just like to freak and fuck\nAnd now she trying to give her fetus up for free.  Her weekend sucks\nIt would be easier.  So used to dudes leaving her\nChains of mind are keeping him, didn\u2019t stress academia\nIt only made him cold with sickle cell anemia\nRunning through the streets like he was held by a demon\u2019s clutch\nAnd now she\u2019s pleading so her son don\u2019t have to see the judge\nHe turn and freeze like three G\u2019s, hoping he\u2019s free to budge\nBut as he thinks it\u2019s easing up, beefing and leaves the club\nSee the bugs increase the piece and release the snub\nCease to love, The Beast\u2019ll come quick to eat the young\nThat\u2019s right.  When a new seed is sprung, he never seen his son\nThat\u2019s when the season\u2019s done.  The streets is never easing up\nSee the stuff, believing up in TV and CDs and such\nAnother evil stuck to profit off a recent bluff\nProceeds to go and seize the bucks, weeded while he reads his stuff\nFeeding off, a scene is rough.  Goons\u2019ll beat him up\nSadly, dreams are tough.  Respect is mostly seen with guns\nAnd so he let his cannon spit.  He couldn\u2019t handle it\nThe loser trips\u2014hit is damaging.  Here come the ambulance\n\n[Hook: AKIR] (x2)\nThis is World War 3.  I got to\nGet mine before they get me, go out in a blaze\nAnd make history.  This is World War 3\nPolitical games that make life risky.  Stick to my guns\nAnd move swiftly\n\n[Verse 2: Payshir (AKA Paydaye)]\nSaudi Arabian sand corruption.  Turmoil reach\nThe Holy Land, controlled by democratical plans\nTo overthrow government, breaking Allah\u2019s covenant\nMissiles strike on Afghanistan, kill an innocent man\nMindstate is Shay\u1e6d\u0101n, spiritual ground breaking.  Make no\nMistake.  Your rhyme connecting my line like cable man\nDescendant of Abraham, Allah Don Arabian\nLick shots and rap more faster than taps from Savion\nMisconceptions form cancerous with these new gods\nI\u2019ll use line to bruise\u2014find another fake crew died\nIs true lies a form of honest deception?  I\u2019ll magnify\nLife, bring dozen lyrics from Allah\u2019s projections.  Here\u2019s why\nI said it: brutal lyrics leave crowds with paramedics\nI\u2019m forced to set it.  Niggas is false like prosthetics\nI\u2019ll rock with it.  Deer Park flow black like HBO\nAfter dark, puffing the junk, reading schematics\nTo know the target, so I can rise above the demons\nIn the valley of the shadow of death, I'll stay gleaming\nThere\u2019s a war going on outside.  We\u2019ll drop bombs\nCheck us out on HIPHOPWARREPORT.COM\n\n[Hook: AKIR] (x2)\nThis is World War 3.  I got to\nGet mine before they get me, go out in a blaze\nAnd make history.
