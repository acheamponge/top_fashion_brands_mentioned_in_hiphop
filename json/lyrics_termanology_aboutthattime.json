Yo!\nI rap alone strap a microphone 'round my chest\nLike a saxophone fully automated battle phones\nCanibus and Termanology\nWhite hot speech black box beats\nYou listenin' to hip hop's chief\nTermanology, what's the prophesy\nShow them how you got the right to rock wit me\nBoy you better fry that beat!\n\n[Verse 2: Terminology - TO BE TRANSCRIBED]\n\nYo we the last of a dyin' breed"}], "artist": "Termanology"}
