No label too\nIf I lost it all today, can I stay with you?\nI kinda doubt that. I got my clout back\nI'm bout to cop a 442 stock golden black\nCop a house in Twin Peaks and I'm owning that\nIt's just a dream right now but I'm doing that\n\n\nHouse in the hills tucked off no phone reception\nI just like the thrill counting up while I smoke the best\nWatermelon juice riding bikes with my latest chick\nI don't do the clubs that often I got a check to get\nI might take the bitch to get some food no extra shit\nTake her to the crib, go crazy then I exit quick\nIt's so much money on my schedule bitch I gotta dip\nBust down green juice online looking for a whip\n\n\nLemonade with the clicquot running through c-notes\nQuick bite riding Sausalito my bitch with me\nKeep it simple white tee but I'm bust down\nEvery time I bring the jewels out it go Chris Brown\nFucking with the titos and shit I don't drink the brown\nI give my hoes days off to go and drive they whips around\nStop by the target get some shit to clean the kitchen down\nI see my girls through the facetime I don't be around\nBut every time I come around you know, new bust down\nSteak and lobster and shit that's how we coming now\nThe house in the hills yeah I'm coming for that\nMayor of my city yeah I'm running for that\n\n\nHouse in the hills tucked off no phone reception\nI just like the thrill counting up while I smoke the best\nWatermelon juice riding bikes with my latest chick\nI don't do the clubs that often I got a check to get\nI might take the bitch to get some food no extra shit\nTake her to the crib, go crazy then I exit quick\nIt's so much money on my schedule bitch I gotta dip\nBust down green juice online looking for a whip"}], "artist": "Larry June"}
