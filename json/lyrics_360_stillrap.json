Then come and get a dose\nI hear 'em talk but honestly all that realness bores me\nI went my own path, I knew I'd kill it surely\nThose who used to hold the crown in this field before me\nThey're the same motherfuckers who now kneel before me ([?] bow down)\n\n[Chorus: 360]\nHere's a toast to living in the life I chose\nHeaven knows it's the one that chose me\nNothing comes free when you're hungry\nStaring down two roads trying to get the money\nHere's a toast to living in the life I dream\nHere's a toast to living in the life I dream\nHere's a toast to living in the life I dream\nHere's a toast to living in the life I dream\n\n[Verse 2: 360]\nMy brain's kind of fried, gimme a sec\nIt's been about five weeks since I been in my bed\nI work, I can't recall the last minute I slept\nI ain't running from 5-0 but I'm resisting arrest\nI can't sleep until I'm the best\nI will when I'm dead, I took that in a literal sense\nAnd while the rest of you just sit on the fence\nI'm starting point guard, go and give a kiss to the bench\nHey yo, in hip hop, you get props\nThe second that you let 'em see your shit's pop, they're pissed off\n\"Keep it real\" and piss off\nThought of every goal I wanted\nWrote a list of all my biggest dreams now every one of 'em's ticked off\nHey yo, I can't look at life on the bright side\nThe only hours I leave home is at night time\nI'm an emcee, no care, stress free\nNeeded no one to accept me, except me\n\n[Chorus: 360]\nHere's a toast to living in the life I chose\nHeaven knows it's the one that chose me\nNothing comes free when you're hungry\nStaring down two roads, trying to get the money\nHere's a toast to living in the life I dream\nHere's a toast to living in the life I dream\nHere's a toast to living in the life I dream\nHere's a toast to living in the life I dream\n\n[Outro: Sam Bruno]\nCarry on, carry on in your world\nCause I'm on, cause I'm on to my dreams\nCarry on, carry on in your world\nCause I'm under my dream\nCheers, cheers, cheers, cheers\nHere's to my dream\nDream, dream, dream, dream\nHere's to my dreams\nCarry on, carry on in your world\nCause I'm under my dream\nAnd I'm never gonna wake up\nFrom my dream"}]}
