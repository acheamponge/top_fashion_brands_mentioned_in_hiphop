Well you decide\nThis rusty .45 is never under-utilized\nWhat goes down like a logo on a Puma Clyde? Homicide\nProbably on these loudmouth bumbaclots\nThinking it's cool to walk around not supervised\nBut fuck supervision, cuz you and you can get it\nLately I've been having premonitions of superstition\nBut if I stepped into the confessional, who would listen?\nI need to change my ways, show me the new religion"}], "artist": "Black Milk"}
