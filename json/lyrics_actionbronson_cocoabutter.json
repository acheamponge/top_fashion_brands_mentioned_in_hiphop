This is Bam Bam Bigelow, Queens to Asbury Park connect: Figaro\nMy uniform Carhartt sweats and Gore-tex athletic horses on my chest and on my short sets\nThe Leslie Nielsen of the weed and the words\nThis is Action Bronsolinni, 33 and the 3rd, kid\nNaked gun, the serial is scratched off\nArmed like Rocket in his prime, blast off\n\n[Hook: Nina Sky]\nOn and on, push it through, we won\nNever stop till the day we there\nOn and on, push it through, we won\nNever stop till the day we there\n\n[Verse: 2]\nPush your seat back. The Ricky Henderson of rap\nJets hat, underneath a little blubber lie the 6 pack\nSummer time I cop the musket with the kick back\nThen sit back, stand up, eyes low, hit that\nThis happens continuously throughout the night\nNow my eyes are like diamonds, that\u2019s looking blue-ish in the light\nLike a prism, shooting out hope, honor, and optimism\nNever stop it till we're coastal on the aqua mission\nReach my hand in the water and grab a tuna\nSilhouette you see reflection of light, right off the Mezzaluna\nThat\u2019s a half moon, wavy like my man\u2019s fade\nThe European carry-all. Color: tan, suede\nHandmade, hand blades, carve up your features, I\u2019m a creature\nSection 39 - I\u2019m in the bleachers\nFiends get washed up like turtles on the beaches\nIt\u2019s mating season make the verbal for your speakers\n\n[Hook: Nina Sky]\nOn and on, push it through, we won\nNever stop till the day we there\nOn and on, push it through, we won\nNever stop till the day we there\n\n[Verse: 3]\nIl prosciutto\nLegend, Phil Rizzuto\nMarijuana like the pussy, I keep it crudo\nThat\u2019s raw, now I declare war\nYou in the women\u2019s league\nI show you how a man score\nLook at my beard and my body like a grizzly\nI\u2019m shoulder pressing 3 plates\nObama - EBT. I'm a G. Supermarket sweepstakes\nStill drinking vintage out the bottle with the cheese plate\nThe Derek Harper with the low Caesar, flow fever\nMore than likely digging in your ho's beaver\nDrug smoke to my neck just like a turkey\nDough dirty, make your brother do a curtsy. no mercy, Van Buren cop Hershey\nSquare Tyson and I\u2019m in the mountains eating rare bison\nClam chowder, you ain't fucking with this man-power\nStraight from Queens, where we're known to make your plans sour\n\n[Hook: Nina Sky]\nOn and on, push it through, we won\nNever stop till the day we there\nOn and on, push it through, we won\nNever stop till the day we there", "title": "Cocoa Butter", "album": "Starving on Reality", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c1ede5df22693a914ce708ed308bbad9.316x316x1.jpg", "year": "2011-10-25"}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
