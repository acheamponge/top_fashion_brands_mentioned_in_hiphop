My name is Diego Armando Maradona. One day you're gonna hear it\"\nThis guy he believed himself, he became one of the best players ever. He came from bare feet, no shoes, no clothes, under the rain, just because he has the passion and he knows himself, he can be somebody\n\n[Verse]\nI put all in the substance\nI do it all for the substance\nCan't put a price on the substance\nI'll lose my life for the substance\nDeep in the lines for the substance\nLiving through time with the substance\nI do it all for the substance\nI put my all in the substance"}]}
