They can never tell\nAy roll up in a second-hand Nissan\nMothafuckas on the boulevard with a fleece on\nIn da cut, deli sign, Pink neon\nGutting out a dutch, I don\u2019t even need a reason\nAy imma celebrate\nHad a good year need to calibrate\nFor you slow hoes imma paraphrase\nI'm a heavyweight, bitch I devastate them\n\n[Outro]\nBitch I devastate them\nBitch I devastate\nBitch I devastate them", "year": "2018-07-08"}]}
