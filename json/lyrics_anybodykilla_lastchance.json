(If I just had one chance)\n\nIf I had one last chance, last chance, last chance, (that would be all that I need)\nIf I had one last chance, just to tell you, goodbye\nIf I had one last chance, last chance, last chance, (that would be all that I need)\nIf I had one last chance... Why'd you have to go!?\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\nIf I had one last chance, I would not keep you long\nThe bond that we had is strong enough to carry on\nInside the songs we sing, the memory of you will bring\nUs closer to everything that's keeping us all a team\nIf I had one last chance just say goodbye\nI'd tell you that I'd miss you until the day I die\nIf I could see your face in front of me once again\nThe room would brighten up and the world would see me grin\n\n[Chorus x6]", "year": "2010-10-19"}]}
