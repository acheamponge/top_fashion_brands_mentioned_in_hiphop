Enlightened?\nNo because I did not sense the overwhelming bliss that one should feel\nI felt that... it was something like despair but greater\nAnd it had sorrow so intense I could not take it\nI could not go on, I failed\nSomething was saying return to the addict\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe international, unstoppable, immortal rhyme scholar\nEmcees nowadays they run around spittin' shit just to make a dollar\nNever made much sense to me, guess it's not in my heart\nOnce your soul is for sale this is no longer art\nI push around a cart full of common sense in the dark\nYou don't need skill to make it big, ask Bubba Sparxxx\nThe trouble starts, between lack of skill and a trap door\nI'm kickin' rappers off the Dilated People's platform\nMy omnicity is obvious not to the average eye\nMy shattered skies, where my retired dreams will lie\nWalk up to the foundation of life, I'm kickin' down the pillars\nTo stop our people from raisin' tomorrow's new born killers\nTwo long winters, and a maze of summer times\nSee more tragedy in front of me, I kick another rhyme\nLeavin' my brain bleedin' throughout the four seasons\nReceivin' the proceedings of my cerebrum then I'm retreatin' and this evenin'\nWill be the last sunset you witness\nRippin' this track apart like cartilage and strength fitness\nMy shit list, seem like it's grown to a mile long\nAs I pile on stress to test my nerves and icons\nI'm like a python who lays patient in the night\nI await and observe my prey way before I strike", "title": "Observation", "year": null, "album": "The Chaotic Knowledge Sessions", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fd019310ffb83c2b956026dc53a60a2b.919x919x1.jpg"}]}
