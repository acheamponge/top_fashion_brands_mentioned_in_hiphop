Cold Crush get it cracking\nHeat it up till the bones blacken\nMy microphone double action, I grab it, switch to automatic\nThe savage spitting it rapid, I ricochet 7.62 Jacket\nFull Metal Gold Plaque classics\n\n[Chorus x2: Canibus]\nI take it back, back to the Golden Era of Rap\nWhen it was exactly that\nNot specifically jams in the park\nBut when emcees used to talk with advanced thought"}]}
