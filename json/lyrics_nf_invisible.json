Wow. You ain't never held me; how\u2014\nDo you expect a kid that you never raised to do right\u2014\nTo break the walls down and make you a part of my life?\nBut hold up, here comes a call from the hospital\nThey told me I should come and see you if it's possible\nI got my shoes to go, I threw my pride on the floor\nSaw a real smile on you when I walked in the door\nThe doc told me you ain't got more than a day\nI just got you and this cancer gon' take you away\nYou say you love me, you can see me, everything's okay\nFor some reason, I no longer feel the urge to say\n\n[Chorus]\nI swear, I must be invisible\n'Cause you never see me anymore\nAnd I swear, I must look miserable\n'Cause you never hold me anymore\n\n[Outro]\nI swear, I must be invisible\n'Cause you never see me anymore\nAnd I swear, I must look miserable\n'Cause you never hold me anymore"}], "artist": "NF"}
