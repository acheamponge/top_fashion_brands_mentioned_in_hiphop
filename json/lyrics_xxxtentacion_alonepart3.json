(Question Mark)", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nI can't seem to find someone's shoulder\nWho will I rely on when it's over?\nTook a chance with you, it made me colder\nBetter on my own when it's all over\n\n[Verse]\nSo when I'm weak, who do I call?\nMy God, it hurts, I can't be calm\nWhat do I do? Where do I run?\nI'm tired of hate, I'm tired of love\nI dug my nails into my arms\nShe turned and laughed at all my scars\nWhat is my worth?\nWhat is my worth?\n\n[Outro]\nGave my love a piece of me\nShe put my heart beneath her feet\nShe turned and left I question, \"What's my worth?\"\nGave my love a piece of me\nShe put my heart beneath her feet\nShe turned and left I question, \"What's my worth?\"\nMy worth, my worth"}], "artist": "XXXTENTACION"}
