(Repeat one more time)\n\n(Verse 1)\nI'm gonna get that heart pumping in that hard chest, sit back the charges your impact is far fetched, yeah I don\u2019t believe a thing that I've been seeing , it's not that difficult to be a decent human being now is it. Now go get a tune up you need new batteries, drained your energy with that complete douchbaggery , who's mad at me, you're saying I'm too bitter, Ya'll acting like Fergie is your little fucking sister. Pitchfork wants to try and diss me, they say that I'm too low-brow , my concepts are freakish, but when Gucci Mane writes about getting tipsy they write and say that he\u2019s an unadulterated genius. I think Jesus is alright dude, I just think when shove him down your throat it\u2019s kinda rude, they're glued to the television watching Glen Beck, another Fox News insect, Ewww\n\n(Chorus)\nGet your feet up off the ground now, everybody move, I\u2019ll show you how to spend the pocket change you didn't use, You're never gonna lose when you listen to the ideals of Mac Lethal and his DJ Skuu. (Repeat one more time)\n\n(Verse 2)\nTurn up the treadmill, push it to the next hill, get a glass of ice water, on the couch , just chill, stop popping X pills, OC's are cheap thrills, give your friend your keys, pay your tab, don\u2019t get a refill. I used to smoke weed in my teens and early twenties, but it started turning me into a paranoid dummy, so I quit, and now I realize that anyone that tries to make you take a hit is an insecure piece of shit", "year": null, "album": "Blood In the Water", "title": "Pocket Change (Freestyle)"}], "artist": "Mac Lethal"}
