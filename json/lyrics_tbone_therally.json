We believe in \u201clive and let live\u201d We believe that what we\u2019re doing is right, and right will always win against wrong\n\nWe been doing this thang so long, singing tha same old song, we couldn\u2019t do nothing but get strong. Ah, Don\u2019t look at me like crazy, Think about it, even Tech and Sway be trying to wake you up from they radio station, A sleeping nation and generation. Wake up and smell the coffee\n\nI\u2019m calling out to all the disenfranchised, Blacks, Whites, Asians and Latinos, Join me in this fight against corruption in entertainment, Politics, religious rituals and Music\n\nI say stop all the violence, stop all the cursing, stop all the killing, and lets become one in this conscious state of hip-hop"}], "artist": "T-Bone"}
