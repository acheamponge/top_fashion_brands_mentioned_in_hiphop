Boy I need you\nI adore you, and I' for you\n'Cause I love you, yes I love you\n\nNone above you and I mean it\nThat's forever, my forever\nI treasure us together\nWhat can measure? What can measure?\n\nWill you raise your frown?\nYou don't have to worry\nI won't let you down\nBaby calm yourself down\n\nWill you raise your frown?\nYou don't have to worry\n'Cause I'm not happy, when your mad at me\nDon't take your love away\n\nWill you raise your frown?\nYou don't have to worry\nI won't let you down\nBaby calm yourself down\n\nWill you raise your frown?\nYou don't have to worry"}], "artist": "Nicole Wray"}
