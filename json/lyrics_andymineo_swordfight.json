Don\u2019t ever think of the Gospel as that\u2019s the way you get saved. And then, you get strong by leaving it and doing something else. We are strengthened by God, through the Gospel, every day \u2018til the day we drop\n\n[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]\nMy mind\u2019s steady thinkin\u2019\nDwellin\u2019 upon the Christ while the time tickin\u2019\nAs I\u2019m inchin towards the wood pine finish\nBut dyin isn\u2019t the end of it all\nMight seem a contradiction\nOnly to those who missing the aptitude for sublime vision\nCombine the boom bap with the rhyme precision\nBefore we proceed to speak about the truth, define fiction\nOutside the Divine Infinite Being we lack the distinction to accurately navigate morality\u2019s system\nIf you\u2019re thinkin that I\u2019m trippin when I\u2019m continually spittin\nAbout totally deprived sinners, we most go in it\nThe record ain't skippin but let me bring it back\nEvery man\u2019s heart\u2019s desparately wicked, I\u2019m wicked\nYou don\u2019t believe me? Take a second to kick it\nEvaluate your heart, lay it against the Scriptures\nEvery man sins, don\u2019t gotta make a case for the stance\nMy conscience is my primary witness called to the stand, let\u2019s go\n\n[Outro]\nCrushed bones and blood drippin off his face\nFramed on wood, now that's a picture of grace"}]}
