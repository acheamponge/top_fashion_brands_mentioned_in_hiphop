I mean, you need to hear this\nLove is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror\nLove is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe\nCall me crazy, we can both be insane\nA fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain\nI mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb\nAnd I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve\nI want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it\nUh-huh, that's your heartbeat\nIt either caught me or it called me, uh-huh\nRead slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines\nSincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S\n\n[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]\nYou can get it, you can get it\nYou can get it, you can get it\nAnd I know just, know just, know just\nKnow just, know just what you want\nPoetic justice, put it in a song, alright\nYou can get it, you can get it\nYou can get it, you can get it\nAnd I know just, know just, know just\nKnow just, know just what you want\nPoetic justice, put it in a song, alright"}], "artist": "Terrace Martin"}
