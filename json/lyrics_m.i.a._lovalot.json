Yeah but yeah but why?\nIf I be the F, who the F be the I\nIf you met me then you'd get me\nBut if you get me will you get a fee\nShit's meant to be free, where's Bob Marley?\nCause I won't turn my cheek like I'm Gandhi\n\n[Hook]\nI fight the ones that fight me\nI really love a lot, I really love a lot\nI really love a lot, I really love a lot\nBut I fight the ones that fight me\nBut I fight the ones that fight me\nI fight the ones that fight me\nBut I fight\n(Tell me fi 'quint, me nuh 'quint my eye\nNookie clean, nookie tight, and that's no lie)\nBut I fight\n(Tell me fi 'quint, me nuh 'quint my eye\nNookie clean, nookie tight, and that's no lie)\nBut I fight\nBut I fight the ones that fight me", "year": "2010-07-07", "album": "/\\/\\ /\\ Y /\\", "title": "Lovalot"}], "artist": "M.I.A."}
