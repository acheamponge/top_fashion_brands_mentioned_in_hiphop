I'll tell you why\n\nYou can not see them because you fear what is after death\nYou can not see it because after death there is nothing, you do not see it, it does not exist\n\nDo you fear the unknown?\nAre you afraid of strangers?\n\nYou are terrified of the things that can happen if you do it\nIt terrifies you not to know what will happen after this\n\nYou are afraid, do you want to do it? you'll be stuck in a loop\nYou will be trapped in a maze, running away from something you can not see\nFleeing your worst fears, can not you see them?
