I made a mistake... yes I did)\n\nHuh..ya know living this type a life\nMakes you grow up faster than you'd expect to sometimes...\nFuck around and be in your late twenties...\nFeelin like a old man and shit...\nYeah for real son... let em know\n\nIt's hard to breath and hard to run when your lung's blackened\nCoughing up blood like what the fuck happened\nRaising my risk of cancer's the answer homie\nBut after drinking something there's nothing like puffing a bogie\nNow I can blame the same product placement in movies\nOr the commercials, or Scarface in a jacuzzi\nBut now I'm living it\nDamn I should a never took that first cigarette\n\n(I made a mistake)\n\nI fucked up, like your girl was riding on top of me\nI should of took her to trial and never copped a plea\nBut this ain't a Christian nation motherfucka please\nAmerica never taught me to turn the other cheek\nCause I'm from Harlem, the north of Manhattan\nWe knock niggas out and make em bounce like Ricky Hatton\nBut wildin on the corner got me turned back from the Canadian border\n\n(I made a mistake)\n\nI knew she was a virgin, when I first met her\nRockin stockings and poppin out of the catholic school sweater\nMom told her she could do better than a criminal\nSeventeen year-old psychotic, trying to be lyrical\nI never meant to break her heart or fuck up her life\nBut I was careless, instead of treating her right\nI seen her again at some club strippin and wondered\nIf I could have made her life different\n\n(I made a mistake... yes I did... )\n\n[Tech talking over the beat:\nDamn shortie, you got me on some singin the blues shit...\nBut you gotta stop looking backwards and remember to look ahead...\nThis is for all my dudes on patrol in the desert right now... for real]\n\n(I made a mistake)\n\nYeah..yeah... I joined the army looking for money to go to college\nBut they ain't pay me a quarter of what they fucking promised\nExtended my tour, treating me like a sucker\nThat's the reason officers get fragged motherfucker\nDon't give me speeches on how you respect and you love me\nBut no body armor in a lightly armored humvee?!\nMy family's lonely and you want me to reenlist for 30 grand homie?\n\n(I made a mistake)\n\nWhen I was young I got signed to a record label\nThe deal looked so good when it was on the table\nIt paid for my cable, cribs, cars and jewelry\nThe studios, the women there's nothing they wouldn't do for me\nExcept stop screwing me for publishing and royalties\nHow the fuck are you my dawg, when there's no loyalty?\nWord to the street\nI should've gone independent like Immortal Technique\n\n(I made a mistake)\n\nSome people learn from mistakes and don't repeat them\nOthers try to block the memories and just delete them\nBut I keep em as a reminder they not killing me\nAnd I thank God for teaching me humility\nSon, remember when you fight to be free\nTo see things how they are and not how you like em to be\nCause even when the world is falling on top of me\nPessimism is an emotion, not a philosophy\nKnowing what's wrong doesn't imply that you right\nAnd its another, when you suffer to apply it in life\nBut I'm no rookie\nAnd I'm never gonna make the same mistake twice pussy", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cbb36cff0867b087bc47fcf98b7cd803.300x300x1.jpg", "album": "The 3rd World", "year": "2008-06-24"}]}
