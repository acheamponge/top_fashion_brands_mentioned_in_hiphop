I need a hook.\"\nAnd you should see the looks that I get when I'm walking now\nYou should see the respect I get when I'm talking, wow\nIt's like the whole world spun around\nThrows out to undergound, I supposed everybody knows\n\n[Verse 2: Big Left]\nYeah, the surgeon's general, sergeant at arms\nBlack ops insurgant dropping hydrogen bombs\nRecognicance salut, report a confirmed kill\nRecord a thirty millimeter grenade launcher mortar\nYou weak motherfuckers need to change your material\nSerial kill M.C.'s diseased venereal\nImperial Lord, fucking Big Left's a god\nCapo regime, original head nod\nThe all-American king of late night, Letterman\nMedicine for all of you head-poppin' (?)\nRazor bleed in your cheek, machine gun to the cheek\nJungle warfare, using the streets\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Ill Bill]\n\nMy worst intentions like a terrorist with nuclear weapons\nIt's Ill Billion dollar Bill and you're a useless investment\nBehind every great fortune is a shooter's confession\nIf only the long-nose dough continued to bless them, wet them\nMy holy water stolen Soviet automatics\nFrom Odessa from street corners to borroughs\nIt's the extra special\nTo these bitches my dick is existencial\nPorno director, let bitches know if they have potentional\nLa Coka Nostra, I walk around with the chrome toaster\nSo coked that my nose is totally fucking frozen, drug music\nLike the coke rock my uncle would smoke\nGot junkies doing the robot for bundles of dope\n\n[Verse 4: Everlast]\nI hear they don't want to call it Hell's Kitchen no more\nI swear hip hop got me looking at the front door\nI used to love her, now I want to smother\nWhen I see all the bastard styles that she's mothered\nFuck the Dalai Lama, it's the drama starter\nI'll blow the spot like an Al Aksa martyr\nBetter lock up your guns, hide away your daughter\nKeep the Irish boy away from the fire water\nCause the fire water numbs the Irish man's pain\nAnd it's the Samurai Druid from the Highland Plains\nLike William Wallace and Michael Collins\nBeat you down, scream on you like I'm Henry Rollins\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bbe0f9bf5fb82894496d9abc9ad26f10.800x800x1.jpg", "album": "Black Metal", "year": "2007-07-24"}]}
