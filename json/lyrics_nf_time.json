'Cause both of us know\nI'm the definition of \"wreck\" if you look into my soul\nComes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place\nMade a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase\nWhen I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away\nBut no matter the case, I'ma do whatever it takes even if\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\nEven if we both break down tonight\nAnd you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry\nI know everything will be alright\nI'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing\nI just need\u2026\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nTime (Oh)\nI, I need time (Oh, oh)\nI just need time (Oh)\nI, I need time (Oh)\nTime (Oh), time (Oh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, way before I bought you the ring\nWe were fighting back and forth like you were wearin' the thing\nTwo passionate people not afraid to say what they think\nLead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree\nYou know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat\nLookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything\nAlways depressed, tryna find a better version of me\nSearching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet\nStubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it\nGot a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em\nGoing to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'\nWhen I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments\nAnd I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest\nMaking it difficult for me to open up and connect\nLot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress\nThat's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if\u2014\n\n[Chorus]\nEven if we both break down tonight\nAnd you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry\nI know everything will be alright\nI'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing\nI just need...\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nTime (Oh)\nI, I need time (Oh, oh)\nI just need time (Oh)\nI, I need time (Oh)\nTime (Oh), time (Oh)\nI just need time (Oh)\nI, I need time (Oh, oh)\nI just need time (Oh)\nI, I need time (Oh)\nTime (Oh), time (Oh)"}], "artist": "NF"}
