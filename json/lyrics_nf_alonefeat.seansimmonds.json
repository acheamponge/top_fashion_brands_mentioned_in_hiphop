You'll watch everything burn, yeah\nAnd this ain't no game\nLiving without Him is just so insane\nPeople, they livin' for money and fame\nThings never change 'cause we living the same\nI don't wanna be alone; hate the cold\nI'm so broken, I'm so froze\nBut no longer\n'Cause I got my Jesus, and he makes me stronger\n\n[Outro: Sean Simmonds]\nYeah, woo!\nI can not face this alone (I need You, Lord, I need You, Lord)\nI can't get by on my own (Like the fly what meets the rain, I need You)\nI can not face this alone (Alone, I need You)\nI can't get by on my own (Lord, I'm here, Lord, I'm here)\nBeggin' You, beggin' You, please\nI'm down on my knees\nI need You, I need You\nAyy, oh, I need You, I need You\nLord, I can't make it without You, make it without You, no\nNo, Lord, I can't make it without You, make it without You alone"}], "artist": "NF"}
