Lauderdale to that MIA\nCold drinks with Grand Marnier\nTo the break of dawn, Kahlua milk\nWhite Russian when the sun hits\nWhite Russians with tongue tricks\nI like the feeling of tongue rings\nShe like the way my whole tongue flip\nShe grind hard for tuition\nShe grind hard 'til her teeth chip\nI make her hide it with gold grills\nI make her suck it with gold grills\nIn the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep\u2026\n\n[Outro]\nThis ain't nothing to relate to\nThis ain't nothing to relate to\nThis ain't nothing to relate to\nThis ain't nothing to relate to\nEven if you tried, you tried, you tried\nYou tried, you tried, you tried\nYou tried, you tried, you tried\nYou tried, you tried, you tried\nThis ain't nothing to relate to\nThis ain't nothing to relate to\nThis ain't nothing to relate to\nThis ain't nothing to relate to\nEven if you tried, you tried, you tried\nYou tried, you tried, you tried\nYou tried, you tried, you tried\nYou tried, you tried, you tried", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e83e6e42fac64e89bad7a360591740e5.600x600x1.jpg", "album": "Kiss Land (Deluxe)", "title": "Kiss Land"}]}
