A million dollar yacht\nCome on we ain\u2019t needing a lot, just a blue ribbon and shot\nBro its city wide, this Philly vibe\nWe sick and tired of lily lies\nTried to see the best but why y\u2019all do it to us every time?\nNext in line, wrecking jobs, blame it on the Mexicans\nHomie we know the robots way more of a threat to rise\nGet your mind right\nFor what? Minimum wage\nWhen it\u2019s 40 hours retail till Comcast paid\nSo I don\u2019t rhyme fast on my tracks, you hear what I say\nSell a dime to a pay ya mom back, get locked in a cage\nIt\u2019s ridiculous the system consistently sticks its dick in us\nKicking no resistance and hitting us till we\u2019ve given up\nY\u2019all kidding if you thinking I ain\u2019t bending down to pick us up\nThe only way they listen is pick a beat and rip it up\nThen best believe each evening I'll be writing down new literature\nTill little kids is giggling say kill it ash you litty bruh\nReally tho, we feel it, they ain't never getting rid of ya\nThis spitting ain't chlamydia just setting up to titty fuck, what", "year": "2018-02-14"}]}
