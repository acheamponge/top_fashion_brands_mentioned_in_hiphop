And now I'm in a real shock\nBecause a fiend that used to work for me hooked up with the cops\nI gotta think of a plan\nDon't want to be washed like Tide\nPay off the D.A. and now he's on my side\nSo on the first day of court I sit there like a mac and watch the D.A. fuck up the facts\nAt the end of the trial the judge sentenced me to 4, huh\nBut I'm only doing 2 tho\nJust some time to get my game straight\nAnd figure out where I'm gon' be relocating\nDon't trip cause I will be out in a few\nSo look me up in a ghetto near you\nDoing straight illegal business", "year": null, "album": "Illegal Business?", "title": "Illegal Business"}], "artist": "Mac Mall"}
