And why do I feel like I'm over this life\nI'm not hateful, I'm grateful, my girlfriend is tasteful, livin it up\nI might even blow, like a leak in a truck, with a torch and a clutch\nAnd explosion that leaves a whole coughin off dust, and the people\nInside me saying, they wanna see me go tragically\nAnd it's evil, cause I'm only twenty something, working for some crumbs and some bread\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nI'm still awake, and it's quarter to six\nI'm trying to write and I ain't thought of no shit\nI live with guilt like I slaughtered the sick\nI live with shame, like my daughter a bitch\nI don't make living but I still persist, I could sell out but I still resist\nSo don't tell me about no pain and shit\nI was born and raised in poverty bitch\nAnd I smile all the while and don't complain\nI'm something like Gil Scott heroine\nDo you know what it feels like to lose a friend, again and again and again, again\nThe bitterness in the killer the poet, the river of blood within the mess flowin\nI'm the bitterness in the killer the poet, the river of the blood will keep on flowin\nPeople inside me say, the wanna see me go on tragically\nAnd it's evil, it's evil, cause I'm only twenty something working for a crumb or some bread or nothin\n\n[Hook: until end]"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
