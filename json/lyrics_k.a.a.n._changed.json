Got something in my throat, lemme drink some water. Alright\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm a big dog, first round draft pick dog\nYou a lil dog, certified real bitch boy\nTaking loss, I can tell you how that fucking feel nah\nIf you see a nigga with it, know I got it on my own\n\n[Chorus]\nGot 'em on they P's and Q's when a nigga walk in\nAsking what a nigga drive, that's a brand new Benz\nWindows clearer than a bitch, I don't need no fucking tints\nIf I can't do it myself, then it don't make sense\nI'm a cold blooded nigga with a lot of common sense\nOutta sight, outta mind, I decline, fuck is this?\nOutta sight, outta mind, I decline, fuck is this?\nOutta sight, outta mind, I decline, fuck is this?\n\n[Verse 2]\nHit decline 'fore I hit accept\nGet a cheque and run it back, cut intercept\nWait your turn 'fore you speak, nah don't interject\nWhat the fuck you reaching for?\nI ain't finished yet\nI'ma need like 20 more years and a pension, depending on if I wanna leave\nI'ma need every motherfuckin' thing I came for, nigga you best believe\nI wanna live like Tony Soprano\nThat might be too much to handle\nGet a sizeable slice for myself\nAdd another couple notches to my belt\n\n[Bridge]\nK.A.A.N speaking: Man, nah leave it like this, I don't wanna rap over this part. Yeah, nah leave this space wide open. Yeah, just like this, don't delete none of this shit. I'm serious. Just leave it\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm a big dog, first round draft pick dog\nYou a lil dog, certified real bitch boy\nTaking loss, I can tell you how that fucking feel nah\nIf you see a nigga with it, know I got it on my own\n\n[Chorus]\nGot 'em on they P's and Q's when a nigga walk in\nAsking what a nigga drive, that's a brand new Benz\nWindows clearer than a bitch, I don't need no fucking tints\nIf I can't do it myself, then it don't make sense\nI'm a cold blooded nigga with a lot of common sense\nOutta sight, outta mind, I decline, fuck is this!?\nOutta sight, outta mind, I decline, fuck is this!?\nOutta sight, outta mind, I decline, fuck is this!?"}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
