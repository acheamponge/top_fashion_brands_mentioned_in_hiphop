For me it's a, it's a fight cause most people are just satisfied with \"it's good.\" Most people are satisfied by just a ten or something. It's not to just stop at ten, you know, ten is ground zero. Perfection is ground zero. We need to take things to a genius level. I can only create so much with this GQ shoot. But I'mma try the best I can. I'mma get tailored pants, put tones together so I will be creative in my own space. You know, it's fine if people like me. It's fine if they dislike me. I'd rather take a chance and being hated. To bring that type of creation to the world"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
