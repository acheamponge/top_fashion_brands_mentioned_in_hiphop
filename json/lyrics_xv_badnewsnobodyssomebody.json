How could the blogs say I'm not nice?\nThe only dude from Wichita that's been on Nahright\n'09 so time to show and prove\nMy flow better \u2014 My show improved\nThe Kid With The Green Back Pack is on the move\nAnd if this sound don't do it I don't know what to do\nCause I'm dealing with real shit in my real life\nCause when you left it all, how do you feel right?\nThe quiet type so I don't say much\nSo every girl I talked to I lost in them holiday months\nValentine's coming up, Patrick's Day around the corner\nSo they all fall in love cause I don't got time for 'em\nThen I lost my phone with a few on my connects\nNever expected that would bring me closer to my ex\nThey say I'm just a W away\nFrom putting the W in the game\nAnd that statement make me wanna think different\nCause I'm helping the niggas that was saying I was lame\nI'm about my dollars but I will never change\nIf you obscure and I don't like you, I won't like you with the fame\nI told Seven I'mma try to be the same\nAnd never turn into these new niggas in the game\nI don't wear chains or Bapes or tattoos\nAnd to say I ain't nice you gotta be cashews\nSo when Everybody's Nobody is that dude\nTell them cats who ain't listen that you got some bad news"}], "artist": "XV"}
