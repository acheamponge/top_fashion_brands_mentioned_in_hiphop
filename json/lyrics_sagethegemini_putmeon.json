I See you doing your thing, lil bruh\nYou came a long, long, long long way nigga\nAs long as you stick nigga, Yeah nigga 15 nigga, 16 nigga\nYou ain't lit up bruh\nKeep your foot on the gas, bruh\nAnd some hatin' ass, be hatin', bruh\nJust do you bruh\nYou are a tank nigga\nJust keep on doin it bruh\nI'll be home to see you sign the stone, nigga formal nigga\nLegend, nigga", "album": "Remember Me (Deluxe Booklet Edition)"}], "artist": "Sage The Gemini"}
