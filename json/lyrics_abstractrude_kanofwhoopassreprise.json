{"artist": "Abstract Rude", "songs": [{"lyrics": "[Intro]\nProject Blowed\nRhymesayers\nLiving Legends\nIndependent music\n\n[Verse 1: Blueprint]\nYeah, the Midwest's finest, amid the best rhymers\nPeasants in my presence, address me as your highness\nNever been the one to debate who the flyest\nOr who shoot the most, or who get the highest\nMy level of rap remain intact for a decade\nTwo classics dropped, my art rank among the best made\nPrint, I swing sound just like a switchblade\nAim it at your face, give that ass a quick fade\n\n[Verse 2: Psalm One]\nYes I'm from the C.I., got my Illinois up\nYes I'm in a crew, but really I'm in a boys club\nReal talk, I better be stacking my blessings\nCause I got a really good deal, and deals bring lessons\nA regular dame met a nice dude, spit rounds for the brother\nHe said \"I like you, come join my mighty crew\"\nAnd even though they rarely play her\nI'm a player, the queen of Rhymesayers\n\n[Verse 3: Musab]\nI'm still singing the late night blues\nRoaming the West Coast, tryna make these moves\nStarted out with 18 dudes\nHeadshots the crew, late the name ring through\nI'm down with the A-Team too\nMe and Abstract Rude in a Cadillac Coupe\nOn the road tryna grab that loot\nRed black green in some black strap boots\n\n[Verse 4: Abstract Rude]\nVanglorious co-founder of the Blowed notorious\nNext I was the X-Clan of the Battle Axe Warriors\nWest threw down that bloody axe and started rhyme saying\nNow I'm slaying these chicken liver niggas in the frying pan\nI saute em 'till I can taste em, I cause mayhem\nI flambe em, I lambaste em\nThe translation, they can't face em, I pancake em\nI lost patience, they got wasted\n\n[Verse 5: LMNO]\nThe frisbee turned into a boomerang\nFrom the L.B.C. maneuver, the slang\nLMNO's the name, Visionaries the crew\nSince the Tribe was Unique, been rocking with Ab Rude\nBless up, that dude's one of the best, easy\nYou can hear and see for yourself, witness, believe me\nTill the next go around you can find me in the sound\nWalls of separation only good for tearing down\n\n[Verse 6: Neb Luv]\nNeb Luv, L.B.C., Jah Skills, Warren G\nDef Jam, N.Y.C., Unit 5 reality\nBack then kept the kush on the deck\nHit the Good Life a few times just to get respect\nPolly with the Mass Men, we knocked out seeking\nAnd set it off with the heist that's when the crew was peaking\nWheels up, yeah, we off on tour\nHit Europe 3 times, hood stars for sure\n\n[Verse 7: Otherwize]\nAll of us were monsters first before the Blowed sponsored us\nKiller Cali King, far as concrete, I'm a conqueror\nCrenshaw's Obama, yeah, choke hold a local artist\nThen I turn they cypher into my oval office\nRappers better off with Jodeci boots\nOr singing topless, or bringing homage\nFuck yo couch, Oscar the Grouch, feed me garbage\nI'm Otherwize on Florence with influence\nBlak Forest founding fathers\n\n[Verse 8: Kail]\nCan only promise a sucker pain, I'm Clubber Lang\nOr I'm Sutter Cane how every quote drive a slut insane\nCause life's a bitch but me and these niggas runnin' train\nSo if you're on the track, step back or select another lane\nDuck a fade or tuck your chain before they find you\nBy the Cecil stuck on Main with stomach pains\nIt's boulevard billions bitch, you know the fucking name\nService 4-3, easy money gang, nothing changed\n\n[Verse 9: VerBS]\nSee the Blowed, Swim Team, Hellfyre, you read that\nStarted way before when they was rockin' a red cap\nBack at Hamilton had the clouds where my head's at\nMidnight Records where the soldier was breathed at\nGot a lot of homies and I'm on many teams\nSeen so many circles and I seen so many scenes\nKick ya ass with pizzazz and the bars man they so extreme\nGotta thank having this style to my upbringing\n\n[Verse 10: Open Mike Eagle]\nWe the last sons of the Blowed, no orphanage\n8 Neos and each has a Morphius\nSoloists cliqued like neocon globalists\nHand to hand, hustle or campaign promo pics\nSwim Team, indie the wold fashioned way\nFrom Rae's \"Faster Blade\" to A-Team's \"Maskaraid\"\nInspired by outliers\nSo R.I.P. to G-Black and peace to the outsiders\n\n[Verse 11: Alpha MC]\nI used to work at Fred Segal\nNow I'm just killing the beats from Ken Segal\nCame in the rap game at sixteen\nYoung dread, clean with freezing the 16's\nWent to the Blowed to test the rhymes\nGot served a lot but I progressed with time\nExplored different scenes, changed y perspective\nThen it put me on a whole separate grind\n\n[Verse 12: Droop Capone]\nThe holy poet keeps it vicious and nutritious out in Pyramid City\nA buff buffet, I got infinite bars with me\nJah love all day, my Imperial Guard's with me\nI'm satellite high, I got Sirius star with me\nAK-day mix and Queenn Anne Park equipped me\nNow it's Blowed and B-L, y'all officially gone fishing\nDr. Oop's world class, don't sleep on me family, or fuck it\nWait 'till I pass and holler 'Grammy' at the Grammy's\nEither way\n\n[Verse 13: Luckyiam]\nIt's Luck, I'm chilling\nLiving Legends, Youtube a few million\nI'm a Journeyman, built it from the floor to the ceiling\nWe should probably write a book how to kill it\nNaw, youngstas don't want that\nSome rock show's Vox be on track\nThat's whack, doot, put that on my tattoos\nBad dude we done been around the world too\n\n[Verse 14: Sunspot Jonz]\nSunspot Jonz, you better watch the real throne\nMystik Journeymen from the Living Legends\nOccupation: Killer --- assassination flow\nWest Coast in here releasing your soul\nFuck the radio praising dumb assholes\nAnd down to battle, get ya at your damn show\nPromoters and vultures, you're now an organ donor\nTo this 4-track king coming out of California\n\n[Verse 15: Eligh]\nAs the Earth turns around the sun and I begin my final push\nYou will begin to see the one without talking to burning bush\nThe one being the wonderful ways the planet shifts into the next phase\nResume demonstrate my embodiment of monumental speech instruction\nFluctuation of tongue create magic\nHavoc and peace and the same time so spastic\nYet so always in control and chemistry soothing\nAlways Legendary, I'm always in the mix\n\n[Verse 16: The Grouch]\nThere's an MC flowing deep and wide and I\nCan't stop rising with the tide tonight\nStopped at a slow light, survived the drive\nMomma these lions gonna ride or die\nYep, all I need is a paint coat\nTo rejuvenate, marinate, no scapegoat\nCodename: Grouch --- never be torn again\nOh yes, God bless the Scorpion", "title": "Kan of Whoop Ass
