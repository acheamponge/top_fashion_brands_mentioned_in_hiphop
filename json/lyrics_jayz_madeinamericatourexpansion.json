{"songs": [{"lyrics": "I'm putting together a music festival that blurs those lines of genre. All walks of life and all people can come and it's in the city. It's not in some far off place that you can't get to. No disrespect to any other festivals. No shots. But in the middle of the city, look how beautiful this park is. It's accessible to everyone. It's inclusion. It's not exclusive. It's not something that's far away... We started two years ago in Philadelphia and had huge success and I'm sure we'll have even more success in Los Angeles, we are very proud to be here, very excited.", "title": "Made in America Tour Expansion", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf0f68ee56f29c8542ad805c6419682b.676x676x1.jpg", "year": null, "album": null}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
