We wanna live it up\nAnd what the people want? Please deliver us\nAnd what the people need? Hey\nI got that, yeah\n\nI call these rappers baby seals, 'cause they club you to death\nI could call em' Navy SEALs, 'cause they government feds\nWhat become of the vets? They drugged up, they f**ked up, they in debt\nThere ain't no love and no respect, it's like a gang, it's like a club or a set\nHip hop's the new WWF\nWhat do you rap or do you wrestle? Niggas love to forget\nWe got til it's gone, you think you on, you still hustlin' backwards\nYour topical norm a tropical storm, it's a f**kin' disaster\nBack to the topic we on, it all started at Rawkus\nThey couldn't find the words to describe me so they resort to the shortcuts\nIs he a backpacker? Is he a mad rapper?\nAn entertainer or the author of the last chapter\nWe living in these times of love and cholera\nSynonymous with the apocalypse, look up the clouds is ominous\nWe got maybe ten years left say meteorologists, shit\nWe still waitin' for the Congress to acknowledge this\n\nWhat the people want? Please deliver us\nWe wanna live it up, please deliver us\nTh-th-this is the, th-th-this is the, this is the hostile gospel\nI'm reaching through the fire \u2013 please deliver us\nI'm preaching to the choir \u2013 please deliver us\nJust keep it real with us, you scared to spill your blood\nYour words rung hollow, we need someone to follow\n\nYou ain't promised tomorrow, so get your paper up\nYou can't always just borrow and asks for favors, bruh\nStand on your own two, never covet thy neighbor's stuff\nKarma's a bitch so watch your mouth and what you sayin', bruh\nI start a conversation based on general observation\nHip hop is not a nation, take it to population\nNiggas got a lot to say when locked inside the belly of Satan\nAwaitin' trial, debatin' how the hell I got placed in this system\nAm I a victim or just a product of indoctrination?\nThey exploit it and use me like a movie with product placement\nYou hear the congregation \u2013 this is the hostile gospel\nThe truth is hard to swallow, it'll leave you scarred tomorrow\n\"Keep it honest\" - our motto, these niggas keep it bottled\nI'm the writer who reach the fighters like speeches by Cus D'Amato\nDJs stickin' to vinyl like \"f**k Serato\"\nSuppliers who ride around the block in the custom models\nBallin' like the struck the lotto, you know who the cleanest is\nA nigga keep it rich with the stitch and Greedy Geniuses\nI'm not a hipster, but I flip it like a sneaker pimp\nExpose the game, treat it like a bitch\nSmack fire out these hoes, cause they snitch\n\nAnd tap wires while I plead the fifth, you can't trust a soul in the biz\nSo be careful who you eatin' with and sleepin with' and also who you chiefin' with\nYou never know, they might've added in secret ingredients\n\nWhat the people want? Please deliver us\nWe wanna live it up, please deliver us\nTh-th-this is the, th-th-this is the, this is the hostile gospel\nI'm reaching through the fire \u2013 please deliver us\nI'm preaching to the choir \u2013 please deliver us\nJust keep it real with us, you scared to spill your blood\nYour words rung hollow, we need someone to follow\n\nFreedom's a road that's seldom traveled, watch hell unravel\nRight before the eyes of the soldier who fell in battle\nThe single mother who raised her daughter to bear the sacred water\nAnd not take the hand of every man who make an offer\nTo black kids wishin' they white kids when they close they eyelids\nLike \"I bet they neighborhood ain't like this\"\nWhite kids wishin' they black kids, and wanna talk like rappers\nIt's all backwards, it's identity crisis\nThe industry inside us is vipers with fangs trying to bite us\nDrug suppliers is the health care providers\nWe cakin' makin' narcotics outta household products\nWe ain't workin' out til we exorcise the demons that's inside us\nPlus they seem to just provide us with enough rope to hang ourselves\nEnough dope to slang ourselves, enough toast to bang ourselves\nIt's officially nigga season, these niggas is bleedin'\nThat's why I'm spittin' freedom, we had enough of trigger squeezin'\n\nPeople wanna live it up, please deliver us\nWe wanna live it up, please deliver us\nTh-th-this is the, th-th-this is the, this is the hostile gospel\nI'm reaching through the fire \u2013 please deliver us\nI'm preaching to the choir \u2013 please deliver us\nJust keep it real with us, you scared to spill your blood\nYour words rung hollow, we need someone to follow\n\nIn these trying days and times\nAll I need is to be free\nI can't do it on my own\nLord can you deliver me?\nThere are trials still to come\nIt's salvation that I need\nSo I'm reaching to the sky\nLord can you deliver me?\nDeliver us\nDeliver us, yeah\nDeliver us, ooh\nOh, deliver us\nDeliver us\nDeliver us\nDeliver us, yeah yeah yeah"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
