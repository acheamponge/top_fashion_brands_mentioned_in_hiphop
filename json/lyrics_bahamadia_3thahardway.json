Big East be comin' through\nGhetto magic plus the bullies back it what\nMe now Buddah Blessed for I and I\nProvide da greatest naturale pure as life that exit from the gentatile\nStyles international like direct connects from internet\nVerbal text blossom like Chia Pets\nPerfect with the mic devices Bahamadee be the nicest\nBringin' this rap thing to the light like Osiris\nFor the Nine pound etc\nPeace to Gang Starr and my nigga K-Sarrah\n\n[Hook]\n\"We gonna rock this motherfucker like Three The Hard Way\"\n\n[Verse 2: K-Swift]\nAyo, I'm doing this for the crews claimin' that they're better\nI'm tickled, ya must be like Sanford on the ripple little by little\nI kick verses of the middle of my brain\nThe Riddler couldn't fuck wit Kannon Riddles\nI remain the undisputed, you should've known if you knew it\nMontell couldn't tell you how we do it\nIf you got the chance to even do the battle dance with the Kannon Band\nShit be slammin' more than Larry Nance\nAnd plus it's in me to give you more like Demi\nI do it easy, leave the hard-a-way to penny\nAs I display skills for what it's worth\nSent to this Earth to put the curse of wack MCs upon my turf\nThis is the end like Armageddon, you're settin' a bad example\nNiggas still using samples times ample\nYo Swift never said she was the baddest but I kept it real\nYou niggas frontin', talkin' 'bout you packin' steel\nYou be sportin' a foot all up in rectum\nBy them Central kids sittin' all up in the bully section\nWreckin'\n\n[Hook]\n\"We gonna rock this motherfucker like Three The Hard Way\"\n\"We gonna rock this motherfucker like Three The Hard Way\"\n\"We gonna rock this motherfucker like Three The Hard Way\"\n\n[Verse 3: Mecca Starr]\nDo you remember those you chose to forget back when ya ears was wet?\nAnd now ya preachin' me releasin' mini-tec\nI need a mic check because the static comes sporadic\nEmcees be hooked like addicts while casualties stay tragic\nThere ain't no glamour in that story, all guts no glory\nEntrenced in jealousy just like the suckers who abhor me\nThey tell but they don't know the core, so raw is now my reference\nLike Mumia there is no evidence to say I am more than I am\nUndbending, never ending similar to million men\nMe say \"just us\" you say \"me bust bust\"\nMental stagnation like the cancer patients eatin' cow fuss\nAs the minds rust\nFrom dawn to dusk I rest in Mecca\nThe words sound power as in energy see Heka\nTo die because ya black simply be no cause at all\nSurreality just like the lengends of the fall\nInitial looks of the shook hearted kids who shouldn't started\nLyrics leave like spirits and the waters Moses parted\nDo or Die's ya slogan but niggas slip with Trojans\nMajor mental corrosion like Murray's meat unfrozen\nI am the Chosen, Earth, Sun, Moon and stars\nHard for me to find a top contender just to spar\nSome peep the exterior and think inferior\nNext ya know they callin' for a Sound Bwoy Burial\nD&D Studio be wicked, catch wreck for infinity\nOne love peace to Bahamadi'\n\n[Verse 4: Bahamadia]\nLike Salt-N-Pepa I take it to the next plateau\nNiggas scream they what this Brown Sugar like D'Angelo\nI make it better fo' fantanics fienin' for the butter, boo\nLike 25 to lifers do from lack of gettin' power; you\nOh, I put my little thing in action, smooth like satin\nOr Special Ed when he was taxin'\nHeads relax and play the back when I spill\nI regulate a flow like chicks on birth control pills\nIll anitics, keep it movin' on\nBouncin' like nylon from 'Illadel to Lebanon (no doubt)\nIt's 3 Tha Hard Way\n\n[Hook]\n\"Three The Hard Way\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c3f333fe50df0474b5bc5c334f14f219.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "1996-04-02", "title": "3 Tha Hard Way", "album": "Kollage"}]}
