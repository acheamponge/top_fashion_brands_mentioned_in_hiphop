Go bother the niggas that is down wit yo' crew\n]From me to you, this Gangsta Boo, and I'm just tellin' the truth\nYou hurt me bad, feelin' strange, wit revenge on my mind\nCall my baby from the 8 and say \"it's been a long time\"\nHow are ya doin'? (Doin' great)\nI got problems on mind\nThis nigga told me that he love me, but I guess he's a liar\nSomebody, bye bitch nigga, I'mma get yo' ass back\nYou played up on a real bitch, now it's time fo' yo' nap\n\nRepeat 1\nRepeat 1\n\n[T. Rock]\nThis is givin' me asistance in committin' adultery in the late night\nMakin' love 'til ya had me where I couldn't concentrate right\nHypnotizin' my thought process wit love,  ? & venom\nPrepared to kill for you, I fold, make sure pistol that pin 'em\nThough you be wit it, this affair is too good to be true\nIt must be blessed\nBesides, yo' man is too posessive & over-protective\nYou want him deceased, I'll be da trigga man on the piece\nAfter it's over, you & I can have an intimate feast\nLet me know the time & location plus how to do it\nYou told me 12 at yo' house, sliced & least dilluted\nSo I'm creepin' to the doorstep of your 30 million mansion\nIt's time fo' havoc, ???,  he'll be evicted on the fuckin' minute\nYou been takin' shovin' & orders\nHe bust & you're a torch\nSliced him to death, threw his carcus over the river water\nNow it's Paco & Miss Lady, modern day Clyde & Bonnie\nLivin' off your husbands real money, for greediness ???\n\nRepeat 1\nRepeat 1\n\n[Gangsta Boo]\nI tried to be good, I didn't want to set him up for this\nBut mama sold jewelry, what you sold you bitch\nI'm cookin', makin' him feel good after it's all planned\nI'm havin' second thoughts but now I got me a new man\n(His last meal)\nLike his ass locked up hell tight\nI sexed him down once he ate his food, this was like right\nAfter the clock struck 9, 12 on midnight, he finished\nCuz my baby Paco wanna blow his brains on the ceiling\nHope his folks don't be mad\nFuck it! I just might flee\nBecause he left a lot of money in the S-A-F-E\nToo good to be true\nGangsta Boo love somebody\nBut you nobody until yo' ass kill somebody\nI'm thinkin' quick, my hands are wet, maybe it's from my sweat\n11:45 is here, I guess the stash it 'tected\nSo blood baths can begin cuz I'm in it to win\nNot to be hurt in the end\nI'm a deadly friend"}]}
