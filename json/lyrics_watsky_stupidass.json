I stay by San Vicente and La Brea where the rent's cheap\nSo you can't tempt me, with a Beamer, Benz or Bentley\nThat's complete with penis envy, and even keyless entry\nCause see, I'm making ends meet, so care to be friendly?\nAnd make ends meet? In my backseat in an awkward frenzy\nOnce in a parking lot while practicing anatomy\nI was knocking elbows till the music zapped the battery\nAnd dammit it was bad but I'm not mad I brought my A game\nEven if we sat there naked \u2018til the man from Triple A came\nAnd it was way lame, but I've got on good authority\nShe boldly told the sordid story to her whole sorority\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I could go back then (Back then)\nIf I could go back when (Back when)\nAnd step into the past (Way back)\nI'd do it all again (Again)\nIf I could go back then (Back then)\nIf I could go back when (Back when)\nI was a stupidass (Dumbass)\nI'd do it all again (Again)\n\n[Verse 3]\nSome days I wake up and I wonder \"what would Buddha do?\"\nAnd then I jump into my fruity little Subaru\nSome dudes'll front, \"How do you do, Mama?\"\nBecause some women see the mula, and say 'ooh lala'\nBut I say 'woo-sah'\nI don't smooch on muchachas who need mucha to mooch off\nI'm cool for like a futon out in Utah\nA yurt up in the Yukon\nWhen hurtin' i'll go back to herding wild yaks in Bhutan\nOr cop a coupe with coupons\nBut when you get a F.U.P.A. like a dugong\nI'll treat you supa dupa we can't do wrong\nCause beauty is a dude who puts the moves on, then moves on\nWe're all moving as true pawns\nAnd get chewed in the food chain\nWe're all nude in the new dawn\nBrain screwed on\nWith a plain birthday suit on\nSo let's graduate human, summa kumbayah, huge honors\nSo you goners should do the do and do wander the blue yonder\nCause trying to fool the future takes too long\n\n[Bridge]\nI don't know quite where I'm going, but I'm on my way\nI won't look over my shoulder, back at yesterday\nI know that I'm getting older, a little bit grey\nBut I won't turn my face to look\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I could go back then (Back then)\nIf I could go back when (Back when)\nAnd step into the past (Way back)\nI'd do it all again (Again)\nIf I could go back then (Back then)\nIf I could go back when (Back when)\nI was a stupidass (Dumbass)\nI'd do it all again (Again)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/15b416d55e0958076696e8b871573bd9.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "Nothing Like the First Time", "title": "Stupidass"}]}
