We're fine\nI think it\u2019s working, the potion is infiltrating our minds\nThe beat sets off into motion and then our bodies entwine\nWe lose control to commotion and then fall backwards in time\n\u201cI\u2019m having visions, we tripping,\u201d whispers the voice of the heathen\nThe night it thickens - black Wiccans\nTick-tock, our heart skips a beat and\nYou take a second to breathe in and then our energies deepen\nAnd then we vibing, we creeping into the darkness, we\u2019re reaping\n\n[Bridge]\nI love it when we do it like that, that\n(Into the darkness, we\u2019re reaping)\nYeah, when you shake it like that, that\n(Into the darkness, we\u2019re reaping)\n\n[Hook]\nI love it when we do it like that, that\nDrop it on the floor and bring it right back\nSpin around the world and twist it like that\nShake that ass and make the fat stack\nI love it when you dutty wine, wine\nGet on top and grind, grind\nDo your thing just take your time\nDo your thing just take your- your cent\n\n[Outro]\n(Cent) 5 cent 10 cent dollar\n(Cent) 5 cent 10 cent dollar\n(Cent) 5 cent 10 cent dollar\nGo on, gone  off\nMake me holler\n\n[Repeat Verse]\n\nInto the darkness, we\u2019re reaping\nInto the darkness, we\u2019re reaping\n\n[Repeat Outro]"}]}
