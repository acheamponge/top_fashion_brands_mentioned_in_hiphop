(x2)\n\nCertified, just to say the least\nDo or die, bona fide\nOpposite the thief\n[?] and they work in the street\nHead on the table, with a little underneath\nBig Willy, now pretty Ricky\nRoll around with Doll and Nicky\nNot picky, that\u2019s just how the game taught em\nBut don\u2019t say his name, \u2018cause everybody call him\n\nBoss! Huh! (x2)\n\nHer, she came up the old school way\nStarted out in the cut (In the cut)\nMovin past tricks, the easiest way\nA smile and a big old butt\nWas another [?] bubble, see\nBecause they all seemed magnetized\nAnd one woman\u2019s touch is so subtle\nBut it\u2019s all just a sacrifice\nFor her to be the\n\nBoss! Huh! (x2)\n\nNow this one here\u2019s a cold piece\nThis mama\u2019s little hustling man\nHad all the threads and even bought gold teeth\nAnd he wanted to be so grand\nMan this is what you call a dreamer\nTryna make a fantasy come true\nBut lo and behold, it wasn\u2019t in his soul\nNo matter what he tried (No matter what he tried)\nHe spread his name across the game and even paid for a little respect\nJust tryna buy what money cannot buy\nThey still ain\u2019t learnt that yet\nHe\u2019ll never be\n\nBoss!
