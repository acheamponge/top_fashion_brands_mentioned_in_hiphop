Because we don't have dreams these days. How the hell can you have a dream, for what? So, so everybody's jiving. Well lets jive on that level\nIf I love you, I can't lie to you\nCourse you can lie to me; and you will. If you love me and you goin' off with Maddie someplace, you're lying to me. 'Cause what the hell do I care about the truth. I care if you're there, like Billie Holiday say \"hush now, don't explain.\"\nAlright, I accept that. Alright, I accept that\nOf course, of course you'll lie to me, 'cause I don't even wanna, of what, what does the truth matter? And why you gon' be truthful with me when you lie to everybody else. You lied when you smiled at that cracker down the job, right? Lie to me, smile. Treat me the same way you would treat him\nI can't treat you the way I treat him\nYou must, you must, because I've caught the, I've caught the frowns and the anger. He's happy with you. Of course he doesn't know you're unhappy. You grin at him all day long. You come home and I catch hell, because I love you. I get least of you. I get, I get the very minimum. And I'm sayin', you know, fake it with me\n\nJust that age for heartbreak\nJust that age for heartbreak\nJust that age for heartbreak\nJust that age for heartbreak"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
