It's fucking bullshit\nReporters trying to win a fucking emmy\n\nMakeshift patriot\nThe flag shop is out of stock\nI hang myself at half mast\n(3x)\n\nIt's the makeshift\nThe patriot\nThe flag shop is out of stock\nI hang myself for your live telecast\n\nComing live from my own funeral\nBeautiful weather offered a nice shine\nWhich is suitable for a full view of a forever altered skyline\nIt's times like these I freestyle biased opinions every other sentence\nMy journalist ethic slips when I pass them off as objectives\nDon't give me that ethical shit\nI've got exclusive, explicit images to present to impressionable american kids\nAnd it's time to show this world how big our edifice is\nThat's exactly how they attacked\nWhen a typically dark-skinned disney villain\nUse civillians against civillians and charge the trojan horse into our buildings\nUsing commercial aviation as instruments of destruction\nPregnant women couldn't protect their children;\nWheelchairs were stairway obstructions\nI had to back-pedal from the shower of glass and metal\nWondering if after it settles\nWe'll find who provided power to radical rebels\nThe melting pot seems to be calling the kettle black when it boils over\nBut only on our own soil\nSo the little boy holds a toy soldier\nAnd waits for the suit and tie to come home\nWe won't wait till he's older, though\nBefore we destroy hopes for a colder war to end\nI'll get a close-up of his head\n\nMakeshift patriot\nThe flag shop is out of stock\nI hang myself at half mast\n(3x)\n\nIt's the makeshift\nThe patriot\nThe flag shop is out of stock\nI hang myself while the stock markets crash\n\nThe city is covered in inches of muck\nI see some more pictures of victims are up\nGrieving mothers are thinking their children are stuck\nLeaping lovers are making descisions to jump while holding hands\nTo escape the brutal heat;\nSometimes in groups of three\nThe fallout was far beyond the toxic clouds where people look like debris\nBut all they say when all was said\nBeyond the talking heads\nWas the bloody dust with legs\nLooking like the walking dead calling for meds\nAll the hospitals overwhelmed\nVolunteers need to go the hell home\nMoments of silence for firefighters were interrupted by cell phones\nWho's going to make that call, to increase an unknown death toll?\nIts the one we rally behind\nHe's got a megaphone, promising to make heads roll\nWe'd cheer him on, but asbestos is affecting our breath control\nThe less we know, the more they fabricate\nThe easier it is to sell souls\n\n(Man talking)\nThere is a new price on freedom, so buy into it while supplies last\nChanges need to be made;\nNo more curbside baggage\nSeven pm curfew\nRacial profiling will continue with less bitching\nWe've unified over who to kill, so until I find more relevant scripture to quote\nRemember, our kind is bigger, stronger, smarter, and much wealthier\nSo wave those flags with pride, especially the white part\n\nWe're selling addictive, twenty-four hour candlelight vigils on TV\nFreedom will be defended at the cost of civil liberties\nThe viewers are glued to television screens, stuck\n'cause lots of things seem too sick\nI use opportunities to pluck heartstrings for theme music\nI'll show you which culture to pump your fist at\nWhich foot is right to kiss\nWe don't really know who the culprit is yet\nBut he looks like this\nWe know who the heroes are\nThey're not the xenophobes who act hard\nWe taught that dog to squat\nHow dare he do that shit in our own back yard\nThey happen to scar our financial state\nAnd char our landscape\nCan you count how many times so far I ran back the same damn tape?\nWhile the cameraman creates news and shoves it down our throats\nOn the west bank, with the ten second clip put on constant loop to provoke US angst\nSo get your tanks and load your guns and hold your sons in a family huddle\n'cause even if we win this tug of war and even the score\nHumanity struggles\nThere's a need of blood for what's been uncovered under the rubble;\nSome of them dug for answers in the mess\nBut the rest were looking for trouble\n\nMakeshift patriot\nThe flag shop is out of stock\nI hang myself at half mast\n(3x)\n\nIt's the makeshift\nThe patriot\nThe flag shop is out of stock\nI hang myself\nDon't waive your rights with your flags\n\n(Two people talking)\nSeriously, if I want to find out anything, I'm not going to read Time Magazine\nI'm not going to read Newsweek, I'm not going to read any of these magazines\nI mean, because they've just got too much to lose by printing the truth\nYou know that\n\nWhat kinds of truths are they omitting?\n\nWell, anything\nEven on a worldwide basis\nThey'd just go off the stands in a day if they printed really the truth\n\nWhat is really the truth?\n\nWell, really the truth is just a plain picture", "album": null}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
