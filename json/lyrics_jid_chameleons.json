know y'all thought it would be a minute before I got back at you\nPara Tu's a classic, and I knew that\nBut y'all got me confused with the new cats\nAnd the third member of that group with the other two cool cats\nAnd that's cool, 'cause I knew that\nBut who thought I was coming with them cool raps\nYou should be boom-bapped in two slaps\nI just light the flame, I'm J.I.D, I'm a new match\nWild and untamed, and I do the same to your boo, snatch\nI'm in it like I'm Smith, Emmitt\nLil' Venice need money\nI'm Trumping out the apprentice\nTell the judge, \"Fuck a life sentence\"\nIf I die, my cats [?] should have a mic in it\nDoing my drugs like I'm Hendrix\nI'm Jimi, grabbing my Jimmy\nWho am I offending\nFuck a prosecutor, judge, come yell the defendant\nWhole court fucked up so I ain't fuckin' with it\nSo fuck it, I'm spilling like what's good pimpin'\nHeard niggas throwing shots, I'll flick it\nThat's a big bill for a midget\nBut to a big deal, that shit smaller than a chicklet\nBack to the digits, I ain't got enough time to sit and wait\nI got too much on my plate, too much to say\nSo that Para Tu 2's on the way\nMy partner came with the pair of new-news in the J\nMaybe six or like seven, I don't know, it was an eighth\nAnd some Hen with the chaser, but that was for the ladies\nNow what the fuck I'm saying, I'm a fuckin' lightweight\nTakin' shots like, \"Wait, wait, wait\"\nI'm good now, then I take a 40 to the face\nYou singin' 40s to next like [?] dollars\nHim pop on them rappers like Matt Hoffman\nNo problem, I done shot him, got a shotta, next they like\nGuadalajara, Guatemala, Idaho, I don't know\nJust somewhere to get me away if the feds on my chase\n'Cause I sprayed it\nI pray it never happen, But if occasion turn to fate\nI'm punching niggas in the face, straight up\nSo follow the fuckin' leader, I'm kickin' my fuckin' feet up\nLookin' for competition outside of E-G, Mereba\nAnd you see who on the feature\nThen you featured in the bleachers\nAnd I'm still fuckin' teachin'\nAnd I'm still waitin' on that shit from Money Makin' Nique\nHe told you niggas you shouldn't sleep, I agree so\nEvery fuckin' rapper or record, I'ma eat, no feast\nYou niggas can join me so that's word to the Lion King\nI'm on to some giant tings\nI'm slaying Goliath, David, Goliath, them giant tings\nConsultin' with Mayans, them niggas high in they lion things\nThis J.I.D, baby, and the \"I\" is for \"I\" in team\nSpillage Village, killin'\n\n[Interlude: Sy Ari da Kid]\nDoc, this Sy Ari\nThis why they call me the best, B\nYeah\n\n[Verse 2: Sy Ari da Kid]\nWelcome to genocide\nAnd then aside, it's J.I.D and Sy\nDon't live a lie, just live alive\nIt's riverside, fool\nMemorize then put the pen aside\nThe remedy to your enemy\nI'm a friendly guy, who\nThese niggas is not your brother\nThey'll leave a nigga scarred like Mufasa brother\nYou got to love her\nNigga, that's from the block unguttered\nWatch your mother, she purchasing a box of rubbers\nI'm taking after her favorites\nI'll leave my number on a old pic\nThen erase it after she save it\nI'm chasin' after the latest at my earliest convenience\nAbe(?) vs. Cole(?), surely it's anemic\nGot a girlie up in Phoenix\nGarglin' my sons\nCouple hunnid like some Instagrams\nShe modelin' for fun\nPut the hollows in the gun\nShoot for the stars, biatch\nShe ain't even know it, Amber gave me the Reeboks, yeah\n[?], you was tripping, you assisted in them hoes\nCool it now, new edition (Woo)\nYeah, I'm sexist, talkin' so rude to bitches\nTellin' hoes, \"No, you can't watch the game with me, do the dishes\"\nWho the richest, well, let the broke niggas tell it\nYoung nigga moves make the old niggas jealous\nYou won't get the message if your nose didn't smell it\nSniff, sniff, sniff, yeah, don't, Cinderalla, don't choke\nNiggas better go [?] for whatever\nThose olks didn't measure, oh no, this shit never was me\nWho knew my favorite letter was G\nWho knew I'd take 'em back to the city like Metta World Peace\nLet's cease, Sy Ari, yerr, ho, no bum sauce\n\n[Part II]\n\n[Interlude: Harry Belafonte]\nPeople count on people who can only count to one\nGenuine imitation life\n\n[Verse: Doctur Dot]\nStupid revolution every [?] music\nKeep my finger on the trigger, keep the temper for my niggas\nHoppin' out of the mosquito like the coldest winter\nInterior dashiki on the flows and fixers\nY'all niggas must've missed it\nSee, you gon' have to get our 1-2-6-9\nAll of them senses, check into remissions\nDodgin' niggas like it's washing liquid floatin' in the park\nPeaceful as a treaty with the sun and a thousand other stars\nGot hand on the bum, other hand on the heart\nLeaves [?] as we layin' in the night\nYour pussy [?] up, she discussing human cycles\nSteppin' at the same [?]\nLeaves in my hair now, she's in my hair now\nRidin' like two trains destined for the stare down\nTook me ten minutes just to get here\nTake my time walkin' down the stairs now"}], "artist": "JID"}
