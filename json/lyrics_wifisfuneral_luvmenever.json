Little nigga, boy I hope you're faithful\"\nDon't make me ever have to slide this thought brought back to the old me\nCause baby I don't really wanna be the old me\nAnd baby I don't really wanna die slowly\nCause if that mean that I can't hold you closely\nThen I guess it's worth bleeding for the moment\nDeadly battles, death I'm facing\nI need some patience, as my heart is racing\nYa'll, I swear, I'm thankful\nChasing down this pain, down wild and I'm running\n\n[Bridge]\nHoping that I don't need your money cause I make my own ends, yea\nMrs. Independent won't depend up on a man, yeah\nListen boy, I got this by myself so get with it or be an end, yeah\n\n[Hook]\nIf you say you love me then this action should be genuine\nAnd if you hold me down then hold me down until we heaven sent\nIf you say you love me then this action should be genuine\nAnd if you hold me down then hold me down until we heaven sent\nAnd if you hold me down then hold me down until we heaven sent\n\n[Bridge]\nSo hold me down until we heaven sent\nAnd if you claim to love me, hold me down until we heaven sent\nYeah, hold me down until we heaven sent\nYeah, said hold me down until we heaven sent\n\n[Verse 2]\nAye, love me now or love me never\nDon't get tension, cold as ice\nYou kill me deadly, but yo on the real just listen\nYour hearts getting warmer but your thighs getting colder\nYour thighs getting warmer but your hearts getting colder\nOkay, and whatever which order\nI hope that you don't take offense\nOver edge, on my enemies borders\nYou gotta take my side for the moment\nYou gotta hold me down when I'm lonely\nYou gotta show me I gotta stay focused\nPlane went and crashed and the pilot couldn't control it\nGuess I gotta learn to just live for the moment\nHold it, bad ass bitch by yourself gon' own it\nThrown in the back, big racks up on it\nYou done turn Kat Stacks all into homies\n\n[Bridge]\nHoping that I don't need your money cause I make my own ends, yea\nMrs. Independent won't depend up on a man, yeah\nListen, boy I got this by myself so get with it or be an end, yeah\n\n[Hook]\nIf you say you love me then this action should be genuine\nAnd if you hold me down then hold me down until we heaven sent\nIf you say you love me then this action should be genuine\nAnd if you hold me down then hold me down until we heaven sent\nAnd if you hold me down then hold me down until we heaven sent", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cac6a7c0dead4e1e75cd05c8b05fa65b.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "When Hell Falls", "title": "Luv Me Never"}]}
