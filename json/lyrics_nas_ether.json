What?!)\nFuck Jay Z!\n(You been on my dick, nigga\nYou love my style, nigga)\nFuck Jay Z!\n\n[Chorus]\n(I) Fuck with your soul like ether\n(Will) Teach you \u2013 the king \u2013 you know you\n(Not) God's Son across the belly\n(Lose) I prove you lost already\n\n[Verse 1]\nBrace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'\nIt's like an AIDS test, what's the results? Not positive\nWho's the best: Pac, Nas and B.I.G.? Ain't no best\nEast, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy\nI embrace y'all with napalm\nBlows up, no guts left, chest/face gone\nHow could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage\nBurner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne!\nI got this locked since 9-1, I am the truest\nName a rapper that I ain't influenced\nGave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas\nWith Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music\n\n[Chorus]\n(I) Fuck with your soul like ether\n(Will) Teach you \u2013 the king \u2013 you know you\n(Not) God's Son across the belly\n(Lose) I prove you lost already\n\n[Interlude 1]\nAyo, pass me the weed!\nPut my ashes out on these niggas, man\nAyo, you faggots, y'all kneel\nAnd kiss the motherfuckin' ring!\n\n[Chorus]\n(I) Fuck with your soul like ether\n(Will) Teach you \u2013 the king \u2013 you know you\n(Not) God's Son across the belly\n(Lose) I prove you lost already\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten\nLuck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten\nY'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave\nTalk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face\nY'all some well-wishers, friendly-acting, envy-hiding snakes\nWith your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?\nWhen these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep\nThat this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef\nStarted cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo\nTo explode it on a camel and his soldiers\nI can handle this for dolo, and his manuscript just sound stupid\nWhen KRS already made an album called Blueprint (dick!)\nFirst Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say\nThat you better than B.I.G\nDick-suckin' lips, why don't you let the late great veteran live?\n\n[Interlude 2]\nI\u2026 will\u2026 not\u2026 lose\nGod's son across the belly\nI prove you lost already\nThe king is back, where my crown at?\nIll Will, rest in peace!\nLet's do it, niggas!\n\n[Chorus]\n(I) Fuck with your soul like ether\n(Will) Teach you \u2013 the king \u2013 you know you\n(Not) God's Son across the belly\n(Lose) I prove you lost already\n\n[Verse 3]\nY'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches\nWhat's sad is I love you, \u2018cause you're my brother\nYou traded your soul for riches\nMy child, I've watched you grow up to be famous\nAnd now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it\nYou seem to be only concerned with dissin' women\nWere you abused as a child?\nScared to smile? They called you ugly?\nWell, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me\nOr make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly\nIn '88 you was gettin' chased through your building\nCallin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers\nAll I did was give you a style for you to run with\nSmilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God\nWearin' Jaz' chains, no TEC's, no cash, no cars\nNo jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case\nJust Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase\nYou a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan\nI still whip yo' ass, you 36 in a karate class?\nYou Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?\nAsk me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?\nNah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though\nThat ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow\nIs he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?\nOh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy\nRocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter\nAnd that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?\nPut it together: I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas\nAnd now y'all try to take my spot, fellas\nFeel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas\nIn a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas\nFoxy got you hot \u2018cause you kept your face in her puss\nWhat you think, you gettin' girls now \u2018cause of your looks?\nNe-gro, please! You no-mustache-havin'\nWith whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans you whack\nAnd your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame\nYou ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane\nTo Irv, to B.I.G. \u2013 and Eminem murdered you on your own shit\nYou a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention\nQueens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons! Ha!\nR-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick\nJ.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick\nYour whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick\nShawn Carter to Jay-Z \u2013 damn, you on Jaz dick!\nSo little shorty's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick\nHow much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips?\nWanted to be on every last one of my classics\nYou pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss!"}], "artist": "Nas"}
