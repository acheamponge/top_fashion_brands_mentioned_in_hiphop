Nah\nI\u2019m lovin\u2019 the fan love, I struggle to stand up\nMy sunnies on, on every drug, you motherfuckers can touch\nGrowin\u2019 up, no repeat, every meal, we reheat\nMum did her best but never seen what we see\nDirty coppers hate that I ain\u2019t been in a cell\nLivin\u2019 life like a Saturday, I\u2019ve been through the hell\nIf you knew me back then, then it\u2019s all from the heart\nIf you only know me know, then we off to a start\nCigar with a wine glass, come on baby, find us\nLet us fuckin\u2019 celebrate, trip out like my mind does\n\n[Pre-Hook: Anthony
