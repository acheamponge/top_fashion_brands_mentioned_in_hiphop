We was tight, we was best friends\nConcealed things. Sheep's clothing you was dressed in\nHeld out your hands, blood stains while I bled out\nDefying til the end but you won't never get the red out\nI always had your back, you always went behind mine\nI always had a minute, you could never find time\nI'd take a bullet for ya, you could put that in a quote\nYou'd pull the trigger, call it suicide, and sign the note\n\n[Hook: Crucifix]\nWastin' time\nPretending that I'm never gonna trust again\nSaw your lies\nCost my heart and blood in my ears\nI'm Hating life, every single second I'm a true pysch\nI'm Hating here...\nCause every breath that you breathe is betrayal\n\n[Verse 2: Boondox]\nI never shoulda let you get that close to me\nAnd I never shoulda opened up those doors for free\nYou put the pussy on me like a pair of handcuffs\nAnd then beat me close fisted, bare knuckles, no gloves\nYou knew my weakness, and my weaknesses was you\nWe fucked till I forget about the sneaky shit you do\nLike goin' through my phone, emails\nAll the accusations\nEvery other day, another false set of allegations\nThe constant lies that I knew that you was tellin'\nThe constant cries, I was buying, you were sellin'\nThe false wording like I'd be with you forever\nThe day I stopped ignoring it, put two and two together\nAnd I seen you for the demon, not the angel you portrayed\nI shoulda choked you out and put you in a unmarked Grave\nJust deep enough to hide your fuckin' lies and betrayal\nLike the rest of all the snakes left to rot. Burn in hell\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Crucifix]\nLike a bullet on a dark night\nWhat's love without a fight\nShe a devil and her heart so cold\nAnd she never gonna let it go [Let it go]\nShe got a mind full of sick thoughts\nLike I could be the man when she pissed off\nEvil things to make the killer skin crawl\nBut it's betrayal that became the devil's dying fall\nA dirty broad with the flaw, just a lustful pain\nTo see her suffer like the other lovers, that's a game\nShe cut like a blade to the vein, with the same, with the pain\nTook the blade to the fame\nJust to get a motherfucker to put a stain on his name\nBut it can never be erased from a shame to brains\nSo pick you path, pick your pill, pick your poison man\nPick your passion, pick your casket cause it's all the same\nThe devils daughter, she quenched like water\nGot you walkin' to a beer, like a lamb to the slaughter\n\n[Hook]\n\nEvery single breath you breath's like lies inside my head", "image": "https://images.genius.com/181444660a65d0000670a98f7f5af756.400x400x1.jpg"}]}
