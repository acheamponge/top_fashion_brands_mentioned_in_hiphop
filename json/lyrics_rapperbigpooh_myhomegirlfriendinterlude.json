So I take a picture\nAnd I send it to, like two of my homeboys and my homegirls\nAnd I'm like, 'Yo, what the hell happened to me last night?'\nI was like, 'Yo, did y'all let me get into a fight or something?'\nSo next thing I know, I get a call from my homegirl\nAnd she's just DYIN LAUGHING and she was like\n'Yo, you don't remember what happened last night?\"\nSo, next thing I know, in the group chat, like I get these pictures\nOf where our homegirlfriend was like, tryin to like, kiss all up on my face\nLike, she was like kiss all up on my neck\nLike straight tryin to take advantage of me and I'm just lookin so helpless\nAnd I was like 'Yo!' I was like 'Y'all gon' let this girl like take advantage of me!\nY'all supposed to be my friends!' And they was just laughing so damn hard\nNext thing I know I get a video of like ol' girl in the club\nLike tryin to dance all up on me, like tryin to pop her stuff all in my face\nI was like 'Yo!' I'm like 'That's fucked up!' I was like 'I'm drunk!\nAnd y'all just let this girl sit here and try to take advantage of me!'\nYo, by far that is the CRAZIEST birthday expereince I've ever had!\""}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
