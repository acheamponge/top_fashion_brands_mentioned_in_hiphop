The odds are a gazillion to one\nOvercame adversity and taught the world to sing along\nThen he stayed in bed for three years\nNow the feeling is gone from a beautiful song that's a permanent part of my head\nWhen they prop you on stage put a smile on your face and pretend you're a beach boy again\nInebriated, Landy made your decisions for you\nExploited your illness, write a song for a bucket of food\nWhen I needed inspiration you were always there for me\nNow I have to change the station\nOvercame adversity and taught the world to sing along in a three part harmony"}]}
