Waitin at your house with a twelve gauge pump\nThrow me on stage, I make the place jump\nRockin over breaks until my day come\nReppin the East coast dawg (Pacewon!)\nI got my eyes on the pie and I'm takin a cut\nI don't play no games, my tools stay in the trunk\nSo if a nucca break fool I'll be sprayin him up\nWho be talkin that \"Rah Rah\" shit? (Pacewon!)\nAiyyo I rip fools quick like I flip through whips\nRoll down your block in a big new 6\nBraggin bout the place where the chicks do tricks\nLet 'em know, who da shit in Da Bricks? (Pacewon!) Like\n\n[Hook]\nYo, gimme your G, gimme your funds, yo\nGotta be me, I gotta be Won, yo\nGimme some weed, gimme a blunt, yo\nGotta be me, gotta be Won\n\nI like ghetto.. music.. ghetto.. music..\nGhetto.. music.. ghetto.. music..\n\n[Pacewon]\nYo I catch a body on real, I kill 'em on wax\nKing of all rap, make you bring it on back\nNever thought I'd be makin sing-along tracks\nI thought I'd be runnin 'round here slingin y'all crack!\nDealin y'all smack or stealin y'all act\nPeelin y'all naps like Vietnam cats\nG'in off gats and peein on hats\nCause none of y'all can't see me in combat\n(I'm the) Pacewon-er, duck and take cover\nLyrics I kick so milk you taste butter\nAnd if you jerks don't bounce like fake rubber\nI'ma react and whip out the face cutter\nCatch a buck-fifty, ear to the chin\nHair to the grin, come and fuck wit me\nI'm ready to begin, waitin on your portrait or tec\nLike yo, where the fuck you niggas been?\n\n[Hook]\n\nGhetto.. music.. ghetto.. music..\nGhetto.. music.. ghetto.. music..\n\n{*scratching followed by instrumental to fade*}", "year": null}]}
