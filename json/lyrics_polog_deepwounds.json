Major, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been scarred by your love, left my heart bleedin\u2019\nMy soul posted in the shadows with some dark demons\nI'm on the E-way in a fast foreign car speedin'\n.223 spit out quick when that chopper ringin\u2019\nWe ain't never duckin' beef, bitch, we not vegan\nMy lil' niggas 'bout that action, they be Glock squeezin''\nRed beams on his head, now his top leakin'\nI heard that boy got man down and now the opps grievin\u2019\n\n[Verse 1]\nI miss Mike Durb, I won\u2019t forget the things you used to say\nMy friends got killed on the same block where we used to play\nI know that death come unexpected, you can't choose a day\nI swear I pop so many pills, shit got me losin\u2019 weight\nOne minute, life was so hard, shit had me losin' faith\nI know my haters checkin' on me, I been doin' great\nI couldn\u2019t get wrapped up in that drama, had to move away\nEverything could change, depend on what you do today\nYou gotta live with each decision that you choose to make\nI used to hustle to survive, I found a newer way\nRemember high speeds in the hot car, tryna lose the jakes\nYou got your life in your hands until you lose a case\nSo much potential in the lives these niggas threw away\nDaydreamin' 'bout my freedom, every night I used to pray\nI got that check and stayed loyal, make sure my shooters straight\nHeard he went unidentified, them hollows chewed his face\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been scarred by your love, left my heart bleedin'\nMy soul posted in the shadows with some dark demons\nI'm on the E-way in a fast foreign car speedin'\n.223 spit out quick when that chopper ringin'\nWe ain't never duckin' beef, bitch, we not vegan\nMy lil' niggas 'bout that action, they be Glock squeezin''\nRed beams on his head, now his top leakin'\nI heard that boy got man down and now the opps grievin'\n\n[Verse 2]\nLil Duck hop out in traffic, let them things bust\nLil Joe be buggin', he'll make you give your chain up\nThis shit too deep, no, I can never give my gang up\nShit'll never be the same, them trenches changed us\nMy niggas gone, I miss them days when we came up\nIf I could be with you, give all the money and the fame up\nThat pain was so unbearable, I almost gave up\nFirst, we was broke, but now I'm swervin' in that Range truck\nWe was wildin' in them streets, a savage what they named us\nWhen it's violence on our side of town, they blame us\nSmith & Wesson torch a nigga, he get flamed up\nThem .40 shells crack his head, fuck your brain up\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been scarred by your love, left my heart bleedin'\nMy soul posted in the shadows with some dark demons\nI'm on the E-way in a fast foreign car speedin'\n.223 spit out quick when that chopper ringin'\nWe ain't never duckin' beef, bitch, we not vegan\nMy lil' niggas 'bout that action, they be Glock squeezin''\nRed beams on his head, now his top leakin'\nI heard that boy got man down and now the opps grievin'", "year": "2019-05-17"}]}
