last night\nI was on there surfing out of my mind\nI crashed again last night\nI was on there surfing out of my mind\nI crashed again last night\n\n[Verse 1]\nWalking down the street and the billboards seemed to stare\nAnd the posters seemed so dated with what they tell ya to wear\nAnd the buildings on the banquet, your dresses don't sell here\nWhen I'm on the phone, there's no reception here\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou don't understand me, you don't know my game\nI say \"What's the malfunction?\", you say \"Internet connection!\"\n\n[Chorus]\nDown like my internet connection (down)\nDown like my internet connection\u2014down\nI'm down like my internet connection\nI'm down (down), down like my internet connection\n\n[Buildup]\nI'm down, down, down, down,

trying to hold me down\nThe system shut it down, they tried to take what I found\nI'm holding-ho around town, trying to hold me down\nI'm standing at the station, in need of education\nIt's the medicated nation, we can't be more patient\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm down like my internet connection (down)\nDown like my internet connection\u2014down\nI'm down like my internet connection\nI'm down (down),
