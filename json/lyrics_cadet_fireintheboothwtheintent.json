Boneless banker\nShe was on my lucky eggs but she ain't sanker\nThis ting 'ere got kick like a panther\nRunaway slap on your back like I thank ya\nWon't know who wanna rings ima prankster\nHis team busts n I am I'm a wanker\nWe all know you're a gemini, don't play that shit\nAnd ___ he is, and if his width is ___\nI'll give that hoverscope and she'll ___\nLook\nEnough of the punches, enough of the wordplay\nEnough of the bars and flow, listen to a lyrical earthquake\nMan wann' talk about p's and wann' talk about me\nSay we ain't on shit, on a Thursday niggas think they're better than me\nBut every niggas on my team, they ain't better than me\nAnd the worst they blow nigga, I can do that's a birthday\n\n\n*NOT FINISHED*"}]}
