You?\nWord yo\nI'm sippin' something, I gotta sip before I rap\nI gotta ooo ooo ooo\nBing bing bing bing bing\nBing bing bing bing bing\nExactly\nBing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing\nIt's rap", "title": "Randy The Musical", "album": "Rare Chandeliers ", "image": "https://images.genius.com/20bdbefccfb30aac00800f75ffc6462d.507x507x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
