Cash signs on my eyes guess I smoked too much\nCash signs on my eyes but fuck it roll another blunt. I'm cashed\nBitch I'm cashed\nLife's too fast so let me slow it down\nThe only motherfucker that ever got out of Howell\nThe only fucking reason that you ever think of leaving town\nBut just look at you now, just look at you now\nDiamonds turn to dirt, back where they came\nSafe to say that I'll do the same when it's my fucking day\nUntil there I'mma roll this haze, keep these raps and do my thang\nEvery day is a movie-scene when you fucking live like me\nGot that frostbite got that heat, bathe in a bathtub full of lean\nDiamonds overflow my chain young Charmander with that flame, snare goes \"bap\" and the bass go \"bang\", spark it with my fucking team\nLittle of rap just a little of me T H @ K I D", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7d93b6e8fc5e0c50003866a806450b85.700x700x1.jpg"}]}
