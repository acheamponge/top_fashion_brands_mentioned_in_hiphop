And felt the feeling of the quenching of the thirst God gave\nDo you remember when your members all were rendered back to sender and the feeling of His sealing satisfied like a Snicker\nThere's relief from the grief of the thief through belief\nSo excited about His peace you recited it to your peeps so delighted to hit the streets plus excited to win His sheep\nHowever we passively sever the action we zealously seek (why?)\nFear begins to increase because you notice your peeps would rather celebrate the world than ever embrace His peace\nThey seem to find it in sweets, toting holsters of heat, finding comfort like the Isley Brothers in between the sheets\nTo them the gospel message is foolish and unfulfilling so you base the Great Commission on whether or not they feeling you\nThe gospel's offensive except to repentive, so man up for the manna from Heaven and represent Him\n\nWe press our claim we make it plain\nHey it's on now\nPhanatik's insane with this thang\nHey it's on now\nElected and chosen to rep\nMain it's on now\nIt's on now, it's on now\nIt's on now, it's on now\n\nVerse 2 (Phanatik):\nI can remember when heaven made the connection and stepped into my section and blessed me with the blessing\nOf a calling and election, He made the call and collection I was all in awe of Him plus I was all in for reppin, But\nI can remember when my feet started slipping and I almost lost my grip cause I was grappling with dipping\nInto the forbidden to fulfill desires that were hidden not facing temptation with the blatent statement it is written, Now, isn't it blasphemous to live life like we have to get this lavish lifestyle while acting like creaturely happiness is just as important as watching our Maker sporting a smile while He staring at us while we're spinning on our access\nThis isn't Hell but I'm sure this isn't heaven, it's sort of short of a little bit of both cause both of them are present in the sense that both are possible, watch it the only obstacle stopping you from going to one or the other is the God you know\n\nWe press our claim we make it plain\nHey it's on now\nPhanatik's insane with this thang\nHey it's on now\nElected and chosen to rep\nMain it's on now\nIt's on now, it's on now\nIt's on now, it's on now\n\nSee acts of sin taxes men, finds a corner and backs you in, and embarrassment harass men til you silent like passive men\nDon't let fear grip you, know the Spirit is with you and be encouraged cause there are saints that have seen what you've been through\nWe got Phanatik and T-dot on the beat, ride with our feet shod with the gospel of peace, we won't keep quiet\nIf the Lord keeps us from cherishing sin or fearing men to the point that we're embarrassed of Him\nSo what's the deezy? We either scared or snared b and one of them has got us caught up and we scared to share\nBut they won't beat us into silence and no keeping us quiet, see we love Him too much just to be kept muzzled and bridled\nMy tounge/, (yours too) is powerful like shotgun power when it gets left out it gets set on blaze\nThat's how come/I will bridle it and won't leave it idle and let it off unless it's setting off praise\n\nWe press our claim we make it plain\nHey it's on now\nPhanatik's insane with this thang\nHey it's on now\nElected and chosen to rep\nMain it's on now\nIt's on now, it's on now\nIt's on now, it's on now"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
