Well, I can play that game\nYou\u2019re not exempt from the growing chain\nNiggas forget who\u2019s afraid to change\nYet a trapped lord, I will remain\n\n[Verse 2]\nHood Pope, I\u2019ma teach these confused folks how to maneuver\nThrough folks and attention, get you choked, you know\nSlim model girls sniffing the coke\nFiend on the block sniffin\u2019 the dope\nI wanna help, I don\u2019t know, tell me the, antidote\nHow you hood and a pope\nConscious thinking, ghetto though\nI\u2019ll teach you how to build a grow tree\nLife like a bike and pedal slow\n\n[Interlude]\nNow you\u2019re the voice of the guys on the corners\nAnd the kids who have no direction, guide them\nThrough the trials and the tribulations\nTeach them the world can be accumulated with patience\n\n[Outro]\nIf I die before I wake\nAt least I lived life my way\nHope that you remember me\nCame up fast, bittersweet\nPlease prepare me mentally\n\u2018Fore you take my soul and empty me", "year": "2016-04-22"}]}
