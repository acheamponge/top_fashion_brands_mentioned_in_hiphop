Then you can relate to this\nOr just blaze of this, maybe roll one up, then take a hit\nToast to the good life then take a sip\nVacay everyday, yeah take a trip\nIt's easy to see I was made for this\nFrom the womb all the way to the grave I spit\nJust to show y'all niggas what greatness is\nYeah, I'm talkin' very lucid, like makin' movies\nTo picture my life boy, you need a higher resolution\nI used to cut class in the day, then run away at night\nBut now I'm ruler of the upper class and I don't even write\n\n[Hook]\nWell it was just a dream, just a moment ago\nI was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall\nI was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night\nThey say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall\nDon't let me fall, don't let me fall\nThey say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall\nDon't let me fall", "title": "Don\u2019t Let Me Fall", "album": "B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7baa76b9a2feb5c035e7dd7da4a2b2b1.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
