DaBaby]\nLemme pop my shit\nI came from shit, three of us and my mom, she couldn't pay rent\nTwo jobs, all alone, she couldn't quit\nWe was home alone when we was jits\nThat was before I was grown, before I was on\nI ain't had no shoes, I ain't had no clothes\nLemme wear your shoes, lemme fuck your bitch\nI ain't had no car, I ain't had no whip\nWonder why a nigga cover his ears when y'all talk\n'Cause it ain't nobody could tell me shit\nI spent 30K on my daughter birthday, everybody had fun\nNigga, everybody lit\nWhen a nigga go home, I don't answer my phone\nEverybody want to leech,

Lord, I've been talkin' on my knees\nI been thinkin' 'bout my pops, I been thinkin' about my opps\nThinkin' how can I stop me a nigga when he breathin'\nWhen a nigga play with me, I ain't lookin' for my phone\nI ain't finna drive away, I ain't lookin' for my keys\nThe fuck these niggas know about me?\n\n[Chorus: DaBaby, YK Osiris & Chance The Rapper]\nThis shit right here sound like some gospel\nI

Rapper]\nPut yourself in my shoes, like I abandoned the race\nAnd you ran in my place\nShoes too big, but they use hair strands as a lace, and they break\nWhen it's hot outside, you don't want fans in your face (Ah)\nBut you might want a fan in your face\nWhen yo' man got a heat and the hand in the waist (Band)\nGotta keep a cool head, niggas got PTSD these days (Yeah)\nSome folks ain't live to see these days (Yeah)\nI be in the lab like Dex, coolin', takin' these Dee Dee breaks (Long)\nThe PD way, I could write a book like TD Jakes (Yeah, yeah)\nWalkin' 'round my city in some house shoes\nKnow that they always wanted someone they could honk and shout to (Yeah, yeah)\nJust gotta remember, got a family in the house, too (Yeah, yeah)\nDon't get caught up with the one that still function without you (Yeah, yeah)\n\n[Chorus: DaBaby & YK Osiris]\nThis shit right here sound like some gospel\nI lost my daddy the same week that they lost Nipsey (Nipsey, yeah)\nAin't got no love left in my
