Wayne ?\nCardi try to B you, you ain't tryna be lame\nAll that auto tune, we already got a T-Pain\nNigga nah!\nWe see through your rap lies\nGot on diplomatic ties\nAnd you ruined that vibe\nWith your stupid ass rhymes\nShit sell weaker than that last record you dropped with the 6ix9ine feature\nCrazy you can't fit my sneakers\nAnd your troll game weak\nYou ain't 6ix9ine either\nEven [?] gods see it\nYou wanna be in his shoes\n'Cuz as long as he still rap you'll always be number two\nI'm just speaking the truth\nI ain't beefing with you\nI'm tired of all this cap you wanna feed to the youth\nThis is proof\nI black on whoever askin' for action\nJust stick to singin' and act like this never happened\nZEUS!"}], "artist": "J.R.
