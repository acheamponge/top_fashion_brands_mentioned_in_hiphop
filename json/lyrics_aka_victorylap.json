Kini Big Deal\nSee the tyres rotate like a windmill\nAnd I will never loose focus, cry me a river swag trip a ocean\nMotherfucker came a long way, ones and twos on IV League all day\nYet summer is still a long way, marathon I run this shit at my own pace\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nHow many rappers in the world right now\nHate it that none of them do it like I\nNever get enough, never get enough, never too much\nV.
