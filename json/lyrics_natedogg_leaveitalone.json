And it seemed like a life-time\nBut I think it's the right time for me and you to leave it alone\n\n[Chorus: Unknown Female Singer]\n(Why don't we just, try to discuss, what happened to us, or leave it alone?)\n\n[Hook: Nate Dogg + Female Singer]\nLove don't love nobody\nLove don't come for free\nAnd if you love somebody\n(Why don't we just, try to discuss, what happened to us, or leave it alone?)"}], "artist": "Nate Dogg"}
