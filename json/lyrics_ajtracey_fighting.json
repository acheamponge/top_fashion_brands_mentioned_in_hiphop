{"songs": [{"title": "Fighting", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI went three steps backward, but then I came through four\nMan's never brought jakes to my mum's door\nMan's tryna put Ps in my mum's purse\nMan's tryna mash Ps off of one verse\nI was doing McD's with the footwork\nNever been an athlete, man ah just burst\nThen I never had Ps, I was all cursed\nBrothers in the cat B feeling all hurt\nNow I spit bars at raves and man pull it\nEverything they wanted to do, now I do it\nEverything you say in your bars, I went through it\nI was tryna kick the shots like Ruud Gullit\nI was tryna kick the shots like Van Basten\nI'm doing Outlook, soon I'll do Glaston\nGrime heads running around cause I gassed 'em\nBruddas want a lyrical war and I'll blast 'em\nNo golfer boy, I want an Aston\nWho are these actor guys? I wanna clash them\nAll the pengers on road, I'm gonna catch them\nAll the haters calling my name, I'm gonna bax 'em\nNo golfer boy, I want an Aston\nWho are these actor guys? I wanna clash them\nAll the pengers on road, I'm gonna catch them\nAll the haters calling my name, I'm gonna bax 'em\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nMan hear my bars and they runway\nYou want a verse? Then you better bring 1K\nI do grime, cuz, I don't do funkay\nRun through the clubs and spend about a monkey\nGyal hear my bars and they're gassed\nIf you want a feature, bring me them racks\nI was in West putting work on the map\nNow I'm tryna build a life, put in work on the tracks\n\n[Hook 1]\nThey wanna knock man down but I'm still right here and I'm fighting\nA full belly, and I keep coming back strong like a viking\nI done spent time in the mountains, man's been hiking\nThey just wanna see a man fall but I'm still here fighting\nThey wanna knock man down but I'm right here fighting\nThey wanna knock man down but I'm right here fighting\nThey wanna knock man down but I'm right here fighting\nThey wanna knock man down but I'm right here fighting\n\n[Verse 2]\nBut still I fight on\nMan's been riding, something like a ride-on\nI'm not any side dish you could ride on\nThink that you're really on job? You could try, don\nYeah, Maniac, that's my don\nLow grass round me, watch for the python\nI'll never let a bygone be a bygone\nYou bruddas need a PC you can type on\nI need GBP by the mountain\nMarble floors, palm trees and a fountain\nYou ain't gonna scare no one cuh you're shouting\nEveryone that sleep on man, keep doubting\nI'm gonna do this, man's gonna prove it\nI never touched it if I can't move it\nCommon sense don cuh these bruddas don't use it\nIf I hear another missed drop, I'mma lose it\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nMan hear my bars and they runway\nYou want a verse? Then you better bring 1K\nI do grime, cuz, I don't do funkay\nRun through the clubs and spend about a monkey\nGyal hear my bars and they're gassed\nIf you want a feature, bring me them racks\nI was in West putting work on the map\nNow I'm tryna build a life, put in work on the tracks\n\n[Hook]\nThey wanna knock man down but I'm still right here and I'm fighting\nA full belly, and I keep coming back strong like a viking\nI done spent time in the mountains, man's been hiking\nThey just wanna see a man fall but I'm still here fighting\nThey wanna knock man down but I'm right here fighting\nThey wanna knock man down but I'm right here fighting\nThey wanna knock-knock, they wanna knock man down but I'm right here fighting\nThey wanna knock man, they wanna knock man down but I'm right here fighting\n\n[Outro]\nThey wanna knock man down but I'm still right here and I'm fighting\nA full belly, and I keep coming back strong like a viking\nI done spent time in the mountains, man's been hiking\nThey just wanna see a man fall but I'm still here fighting\nThey wanna knock man down but I'm still right here and I'm fighting\nA full belly, and I keep coming back strong like a viking\nI done spent time in the mountains, man's been hiking\nThey just wanna see a man fall but I'm still here fighting", "year": "2016-08-26", "album": "Brotherhood: Music from the Motion Picture", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d736f74201882498e7c796e0edf94808.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "AJ Tracey"}
