Floating?\nI'm serious, my heart is curious\n'Cause I'm confused when we're together\nFeels like I am choking with all these emotions\nYou maybe the one for me, I think it's pretty plain to see\nWhen he said more money, more fucking blessings\nShe said more money, more reckless friends\nAnd she said more money, more sex and extra extra credit, extra braces, diamond necklaces\nAnd I know you love me but I will never let my crush crush me\nAnd I know I love you but poppa said don't let your crush crush you\n\n[Hook: Rowlene]\nAnd that's why I contain that they say I am crazy\nI am blazing through all these phases\nI contain that they say I am crazy\nI am blazing through all these phases\n\n[Outro: Rowlene]\nI contain it, I am crazy\nI am blazing through all these phases\nI contain it , I am crazy\nI am blazing through all these phases\nI contain it, through all these phases"}], "artist": "Nasty C"}
