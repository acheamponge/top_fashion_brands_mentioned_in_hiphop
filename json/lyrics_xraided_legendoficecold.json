from the ghetto's and slums\nGhetto's and slums\nGhetto's and slums\nStory for my niggas from the ghetto's and slums\nAnd every neighborhood full of urban rebels and bums\n\nThis is a story for my niggas from the ghetto's and slums\nGhetto's and slums\nGhetto's and slums\nThis is a story for my niggas from the ghetto's and slums\nAnd every neighborhood full of urban rebels and bums\n\n[Verse 1]\nHey, This is a story for my niggas from the ghetto's and slums\nEvery neighborhood full of urban rebels and bums\nIt's so hot, You would swear it's where the devil is from\nIt's rock n roll but the only heavy metal is guns\nRoses often placed on coffins for the dead at receptions\nSomebody filled his head with more Led than Zepplin\nKept his weapon in his holster, When he was supposed to shoot it\nGuess the truth is he wasn't half Loc'd as reputed\nYou might refute it\nImma tell you the whole story, Compute it\nImma paint a picture in your mind\nTake your time, Review it, I can't dispute it\nThis nigga was a dangerous thug, He was a 'Rip\nBut he would bang on his own gang and the Bloods\nHe was deranged in the brain\nSick and insane and it showed\nA tickin time bomb conditioned and trained to explode\nLike somebody injected nitro in his veins and they froze\nSo naturally, Ice Cold was the name that he chose\nHe was big swole nigga, His arms was 20 inches\nA scar on his left cheek from 150 stitches, Razor residue\nHad a feud with a dude on Meadowview Road and 29th\nWho drew a knife and then he sliced\nThe night in question, It wasn't less than 9 o'clock on the dot\nIce Cold was ridin around with a 9 Glock and a plot, Dirt broke\nBut you know how we do it in Sac\nWe put in work, Loc\nIn the streets pursuin a jack\nHe saw a black 'Lac truck\nAs it stopped at the intersection on Franklin and Florin Road\nHe headed in it's direction\nFollowed it down Franklin until it made a right on Mack\nAnd when that turned into Meadowview Road\nIt was time to make it crack\nDriver was on the phone, So he didn't notice it comin\nWhen Ice Cold got out the car holdin chrome, He started gunnin\nTarget was the driver's head\nThe first slug shattered the window\nThe second left the driver dead as the slug battered his temple\nBlood splattered the window\nIce Cold didn't give a fuck\nHe just slowly moved closer\nTook a look in the truck\nPassenger was a child, About 11, Maybe, Not even\nHad a hole in his chest\nHe was wheezin but still breathin\nNot even the nigga Ice Cold was willin to kill a kid\nSo he said, \"Good luck lil' man, You might live\"\nHe stripped the money and jewelry from the victim and cut\nTrue to his name, Not the slightest twinge of guilt in his gut\nThe kid was still in the truck, Too terrified to move\nLooked to his left\nAnd saw that his big brother lied in a pool of his own blood\nIn desperation, Picked the phone up\nNot realizing the left side of his brother's face was blown up\nHe dialed 911, Said\n\"Send me an ambulance, My brother is hurt\"\n\"And if you don't hurry, He won't stand a chance\"\nOperator pleaded, \"Talk to me, Please, Just keep fightin\"\nThen the kid started cryin and said\n\"Help me, I think I'm dyin\"\n\n[Hook]\nPicture this, 5 surgeons tryin to keep you alive\nYou done lost too much blood\nYou're too weak to survive\nThey keep fightin, Ordering pints for transfusions\nGot your arteries exposed with clamps attached to 'em\nBlack screen, Green dots, Your pulse is fading\nYou're getting closer to Satan\nYour mama hopin and prayin that you can make it\nBut the doctor started shakin his head\n\"Nothing more that we can do\"\nAnd then he stated, \"He's dead\"\n\n[Verse 2]\n5 years past, Ice Cold is still bangin\nRepresentin Garden Blocc\nShowin no signs of changin\nNever got arrested for shootin the kid and his brother\nUnsolved mystery, The truth was never discovered\nThe kid recovered from his injuries, Eventually\nAfter years of being physically and mentally in misery\nHis memory was vivid\nHe could close his eyes and visualize\nThe minute he realized his brother was dead\nHe couldn't get it out his head, Just couldn't understand\nAnd in homage to the killer, Took the name \"Lil' Man\"\nListen, The nigga Ice Cold was stickin to the thug thang\nGettin G'z, Flippin them Ki's in the drug game\nA nigga from the Blood gang named Damu who had big crack\nGot followed home one night\nDuct taped and kidnapped\nButt raped and bitch slapped by a nigga in a mask\nWho had a Mizzac and asked, \"Where the muthfuckin bricks at?\"\nWouldn't give up the coke, Damu was a rida\nSo Ice Cold started pullin out his toe nails with a pliers\nIt was gruesome, He grabbed his baby\nAnd threatened to shoot him if he didn't give up the birds\nSo Damu produced them\nIce Cold emerged from the lick with 10 chickens\nAnd 150 Thousand cash that he found stashed in the kitchen\nHe went on a mission with intent of strictly stackin his paper\nIce Cold never looked back after that caper\nBut life was slow for Lil' Man\nHis cash was gettin short\nThe only thing on his mind was graspin and gettin more\nHavin flashes of smashin and robbin a liquor store\nBlastin the clerk like O-Dog and dashin to hit the door\nStandin on a bridge askin, \"What am I livin for?\"\nHavin thoughts of jumpin off and smashin the river floor\nOften askin Jesus, \"What you hatin a nigga for?\"\nPlease tell me, Why have you forsaken a nigga, Lord?\nWhispers from Satan\n\"Fuck prayin and fuck patience\"\n\"You want it? You take it\"\n\"Fuck waitin and fuck playin\"\nAt the point of breakin\nLil' Man decided that he had it up to here with being broke\nGot his strap and hit traffic\nHe stopped at a red light on Mack Rd. and Stockton Blvd\nBy the Motel 6, The parkin lot was full of cars\nA blue Lexus coupe, He couldn't help but spot it\nAs it headed toward the exit\nHe grabbed his Tek and cocked it\nFollowed at a distance, Palms all sweaty\nHands shakin on the stearin wheel, But he felt ready\nNo turnin back now, On Florin Rd. and Power Inn\nIt's the turnin point of the story\nHomie, Now it begins\nLil' Man opened up his car door and rose\nGun in hand, Ran to the side of the Lexus and froze\nThe driver was dark skinned, Familiar scar on his cheek\nThey made eye contact, Hearts started to speed\nIce Cold floored the gas pedal, Lil' Man started gunnin\nIce Cold lost control, Lil' Man started runnin\nCrashed into a phone pole, Air bags deflated\nLil' Man opened the door\nGrabbed his throat and stated\n\"Yeah, Bitch-ass nigga, I know you remember me\"\n\"Look into my eyes, Let me refreshin your memory\"\n\"You the one who shot me in the chest and murdered my brother\"\n\"You should of killed me, Nigga, You stupid muthafucka\"\nHe beat him with the butt of the gun\nAnd at the height of the pain\nHe put the barrel to his head and shot him right in the brain\nMan murdered Ice Cold, Took his life in the rain\nWhat goes around comes around\nThat's just life in the game\n\n[Hook]\nPicture this, 5 surgeons tryin to keep you alive\nYou done lost too much blood\nYou're too weak to survive\nThey keep fightin, Ordering pints for transfusions\nGot your arteries exposed with clamps attached to 'em\nBlack screen, Green dots, Your pulse is fading\nYou're getting closer to Satan\nYour mama hopin and prayin that you can make it\nBut the doctor started shakin his head\n\"Nothing more that we can do\"\nAnd then he sated, \"He's dead\""}], "artist": "X-Raided"}
