I need you desperately\nNot just for the moment, to make history\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nSo now I\u2019m flirting with death\nHustling like a G, while victory wasn\u2019t watching\nTook chances repeatedly\nAs a teenage boy, before acne\nBefore I got proactive, I couldn\u2019t face she\nI just threw on my hoodie and headed to the streets\nI swear I met success, we lived together shortly\nA success is like lust, she's good for the touch\nShe's good for the moment, but she\u2019s never enough\nEverybody\u2019s had her, she\u2019s nothing like V\nA success is all I got, unfortunately\nBut I\u2019m burning down the block, hopin' in and out of V's\nBut something tells me that there\u2019s much more to see\nBefore I get killed, cause I can\u2019t get robbed\nSo before me, success and death m\u00e9nage\nI gotta get lost, I gotta find V\nWe gotta be together to make history\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nNow victory is mine, she tastes so sweet\nShe\u2019s my trophy wife, she's coming with me\nWe'll have a baby who stutters repeatedly\nWe'll name him history, he'll repeat after me\nHe\u2019s my legacy, son of my hard work\nFuture of my past, he\u2019ll explain who I be\nRank me amongst the greats, either 1, 2 or 3\nIf I ain\u2019t number one then I failed you victory\nAin\u2019t in it for the fame, that dies within weeks\nAin\u2019t in it for the money, can\u2019t take it when you leave\nI wanna be remembered long after you grieve\nLong after I\u2019m gone, long after I breathe\nI leave all I am, in the hands of history\nThat's my last will testimony\nThis is much more than a song, it\u2019s a baby shower\nI\u2019ve been waiting for this hour, history, you're ours", "title": "History", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0ab8f985f047cd61a94db4436b692609.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": null, "album": "More than a Game: Music Inspired by the Film "}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
