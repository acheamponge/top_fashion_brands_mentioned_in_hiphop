How ya been? Roll Tide! Amen!\nThe Heart of Dixie\u2019s in this bitch, yeah I\u2019m Dixie rich\nBut if I don\u2019t have y\u2019all, I ain\u2019t got shit\nGadsden, B-Ham, to the Gump\nAnd all the small towns\nThrow it up, it\u2019s that Alabama sound\nMuch love and I never let you down\n\n\u2018Cause I might as well be dropped\nBack in Gadsden and cuttin\u2019 grass\nOr handcuffed on the side of the road, on my fuckin\u2019 ass\nBefore I become complacent on any level that I\u2019m at\nMomma will quit drinking and Obama will smoke some crack\nLost, yeah I may have, my mind\nBut it takes a lunatic to pursue this shit\nAy that\u2019s fine, because I paid the cost\nReally more like a fine, but instead of paying for tickets now\nThey pay for tickets in line, to see me drain exhaust\nThe pain from the mic, from the strain it cost\nTwo-step in my shoes with a shameless walk\n300 soldiers I brought, Wolf-Pack follow my lane and put chalk\nAround suckers dying for change and talk\nThe New South\u2019s got a new house\nWith a frame and a stump\nRoots and limbs, the truth\u2019s in him\nYeah I\u2019m a grain of salt\nPreachers yelling out, prophets around Wayne\nI refrain, I\u2019m a couch, I\u2019m a chair, I\u2019m a seat\nA relief pitcher, or beer in the mouth\nI\u2019m a sofa to hold ya, just ride the beat homey, it\u2019s over\nWhatever rapper would ever say he\u2019s a sober?\nI must be smoking bath salt, \u2018cuz I\u2019m out of my mind!\nI should have built roads for a livin', cuz I never run out of lines\nThe Heart of Dixie", "title": "Howdy"}]}
