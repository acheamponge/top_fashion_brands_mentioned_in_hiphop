Called to be a prophet at a young age, it caused fear in his heart to speak what the Lord gave him to say. But God told him, \"you're not a boy, you're a prophet.\"...So pretty much fear not, know what I mean? So whatever he had to say for that day...the feeling that he had then, I have right now\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd it burns real deep (eeh)\nSaid it burns real deep\nJeremiah said it\u2019s just like fire, yea\nSaid it burns real deep\n\n[Bridge]\nGirl I love you\nYes, I still love you\n(Yes I do)\nAlways love you\n(Always love you)\nForever love you\n(Forever love you)\n\nPart 2: \"World Needs More Love\"\n\nSince God is love\nThe whole world needs more love"}], "artist": "BJ the Chicago Kid"}
