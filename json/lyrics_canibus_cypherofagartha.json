Nice with his hands\nNice with a newspaper rolled up tight, assault rifle or a knife\n24 inch machete, 24 hours to live\nCome get me, my THUG Theory deadly\nLyrical Law is tribunal communal court\nOne juror with six faces, they all talk\nAt the same time til' the people's minds are distraught\nJavelin swords you know what they for, split your jaw\nEverybody's surprised that you made it this far\nTens of thousands of songs the catalog just goes on\nIt's Lyrical Law, say no more! erse"}]}
