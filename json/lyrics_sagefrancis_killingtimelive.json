Blow off the dust mites I just might bust mics\nPut up fights throw fisticuffs and thrust strikes\nWith enough might to hold it off in the meantime\nCuz Time ain't nice I'm climbing for life so I don't mind the price\nI have to pay day after day to make the laughter stay\nAnd teardrops fade away\nUnderstand the plan, scheme, scam, and plot\nRemove your lips from the bottle and your hammer from the Glock\nI'm tryin to make the clock draw blood while I be spilling mine\nPutting a chill in my spine ready and willing I'm\nKilling Time I'm killing killing time\nTrying to make the clock draw blood while I be spilling mine\nI'm Killing Time", "album": null}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
