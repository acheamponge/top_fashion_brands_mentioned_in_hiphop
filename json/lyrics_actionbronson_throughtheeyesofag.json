Forget this shit...but a hit of crack will do for now\n\n[Verse 1: Action Bronson]\nYeah...through the eyes of a G\nThrough the eyes of a G, see me in the all white Eclipse\nA husband pay me 10 stacks to fuck his bitch\nHand up her ass like a Muppet baby, it's crazy\nWhile she do a buck-eighty in a mustard Mercedes\nI move the mustard from Russia to Haiti\nForty-fives will kiss your neck like the touch from a lady\nFuck with my lunch and then the pump leaves you under the daisies\nYou know your bitch is just another cocksucker with rabies\nI'm signing autographs in Spanish, I live with Michael Jackson's anguish\nHop in the Vanquish and vanish off the manor in a strange manner\nAim the hammer at your dame's bladder, like it ain't matter\nI smoke 'til I got down syndrome\nTan gators, brown linen\nMulti-color money, seven different kinds of cheeses\nMy silhouette resembles Jesus in all seasons\nTake a ginger shot, doing concentration curls with the cinderblocks\nDoing squats, hope the ox don't drop out\nDon't make me have to slap the fire out your pop's mouth\n\nIt's me...uh\nThrough the eyes of a G\n\n[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]\nYo\nThrough the eyes of a G\nA-B, utilize what you and I use to see\nTo move forward\nCause I get bored with niggas talking 'bout\nWho they used to be, what they used to do\nMy homie headed to court, not for a 2-on-2\nIronically, I'll have you know we do it for the sport\nOr at least to keep a little gold in this uniform\nI'm abnormal like a unicorn that you could get on\nCows jump over moons when my nouns and verbs move\nEtiquette of a veteran, still getting checks\nYou get a F for your efforts, we never trade techs\nI tried to keep the peace but now I gotta keep the piece\nI speak in synchronistic frequency with triggers squeezing\nAnd one day I'll drop to my knee and repent to Jesus\n'Til then I'm humping my lust demons for no reason\nSoul-o ho, from Del Amo to SoHo, ho\n\nYo, yo, check, \"you do not know me, no, no, no\nYou do not know me but I know you-\"\nI had to, I had to do it", "title": "Through The Eyes of a G", "album": "Blue Chips 2", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3tkvpk6nyazea6ub0nsnj8s01.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2013-11-01"}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
