The effects of slavery have had a far reaching\nEffect on black people in America\nThe scars run deep\nNot just the physical, but the emotional and psychological scars as well\nAnd they still hurt today\nIt's been said before, that we can't know\nWhere we are going, without knowing where we have been\nFollow along, as Akrobatik takes us on a journey\nBack to how things started for us here\nAnd links topics to what we're dealing with, to this day\n\n[Akrobatik]\nIt took me six years to build up enough courage to run\nAnd only six hours to be facing the barrel of a gun\nNot knowing if it's the last time I'd ever see my sons\nAnd that's punishment enough, still the pain has just begun\n\nLife flashes, whether from the whip lashes\nHe's threatening to burn me in my own ashes\nBrown skin is now purple, it comes full circle\nWhen the pain that I'll endure is the pain I have to work through\n\nFor now my body lies listless\nWishing that my wife wasn't forced to witness\nWishes she wasn't forced to be master's mistress\nWishes she wasn't forced to be under this disstress\n\nHow did we ever get into this mess\nWe came from kings, now we're wearing rags\nEating unmentionable things, the stings\nFrom the welds on my back make me wanna attack\nAnd be a martyr for blacks, but then the whip cracks\nAnd brings me back to reality, madness brutality\nThat leads to fatalities\n\nAnd if he knew I was reading books and getting smarter\nIt would only make him whip me harder\nSometimes I thank God I never had a daughter\nBut even if I did it might definately connect\nThrough the pain, our soul's kindred\n\n[Hook - Brenna Gethers]\nHmm-mm-mm, we are kindred\nThrough our name\n\n[Chuck D]\nHurricane Katrina and her aftermath\nHave long since been forgotten by many of those unaffected by her wrath\nFelt in 2005\nOnce again our people have been displaced by the thousands\nAnd were left to fend for themselves\nWhile those more fortunate were able to escape\nLet's take a look at what may have been going on\nThrough the mind of victims of America's most infamous natural disaster\n\n[Akrobatik]\nI'm on my rooftop, sick and thirsty, asking God for mercy\nPlease spare my wife, she's only thirty\nSchoolbuses float atop murky waters, could they have\nUsed them to at least evacuate our sons and daughters?\n\nWe sleep because we have no choice, dehydrated\nAnd we can't scream for because we have no voice\nCrying for what the helicopters never dropped us\nThe stench of bodies in piles is evident for miles\n\nBroke with little home, laid off with little income\nGhetto life is no joke, I'm broke and then some\nMy son is on his stomach, body riddled with heavy shakes\nI guess we now know what happens when the levee breaks\n\nFor now my body lies listless\nWhishing that my wife wasn't forced to witness\nWhishes she wasn't forced to be without me for Christmas\nWhishes she wan't forced to be under this disstress\n\nHow did we ever get into this mess\nWe came from kings, now I feel I truly know why the caged bird sings\nHe sings to keep his mind of the pain of things\nBut the way that we were left to remain, it stings\n\nStings like the welds on the back of my kin\nNow replaced by the toxic water attacking my skin\nI bet CNN is broadcasting this slaughter\nAs gasprices rise like the water\n\nI thank God I never had a daughter\nBut even if I did it might definately connect\nThrough the pain, our soul's kindred\n\n[Hook - Brenna Gethers]\nHmm-mm-mm, we are kindred\nThrough our name", "title": "Kindred", "album": "Absolute Value"}], "artist": "Akrobatik"}
