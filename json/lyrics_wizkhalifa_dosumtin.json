Cuz' i keep it fly, fresh when I'm creepin' by\nGot a mean team, but for me, I'm a peaceful guy\nBut don't get out of line, cuz' for them dollar signs\nThe full clip, will make a nigga's thoughts sit out his mind\n\nChorus - (Wiz Khalifa)\nIf it's on and poppin', go ahead and move somethin'\nAnd if a hater trip, go ahead and do somethin'\nIf it's on your chest, go ahead and prove somethin'\nIf not, stop frontin', you niggas ain't hurtin' nothin', no (X2)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/22079eaff0395f48f7e1891ca05897a0.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Prince of the City: Welcome to Pistolvania", "title": "Do Sumtin"}]}
