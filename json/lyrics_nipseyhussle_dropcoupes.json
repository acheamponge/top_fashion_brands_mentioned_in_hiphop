But niggas not trill at all\nNiggas is playin' with me, like sushi ain\u2019t really raw\nLike guns don\u2019t really kill, and bullets ain\u2019t really hot\nLike I ain't a fuckin' fool, 2000-and-20 Pac\nHe said hit 'em up, X said shut 'em down\nI been going hard, ain\u2019t no stopping now\n\n[Chorus]\nPull up in drop coupes\nHopped in them V12\u2019s\nWent from them mixtapes, shut down retail\nSwitchin' my line nigga, she hittin' my Twitter, fool\nNiggas is sprung on pussy\nMe, I\u2019m just payin' dues\n\n[Verse 3]\nI can\u2019t see the ceiling, y'all can\u2019t see the reason\nI keep killin' niggas, but I can\u2019t leave em breathin'\nBro said do it to 'em, I\u2019m gon' do it to 'em\nSee these brick walls? I keep on going through 'em\nThey can't stop it, nigga, this my profit, nigga\nIt\u2019s my real sweat, y'all ain\u2019t killed shit\nBut if you a real nigga, had to do real shit\nCome from a real struggle, hustle and deal shit\nPromise you feel this, know that you fearless\nAll of my real Bloods, all of my real Crips\nDoing her thang for you, shout out that real bitch\nHop on them planes, nigga, taking them field trips\n\n[Chorus]\nPull up in drop coupes\nHopped in them V12\u2019s\nWent from them mixtapes, shut down retail\nSwitchin' my line nigga, she hittin' my Twitter, fool\nNiggas is sprung on pussy\nMe, I\u2019m just payin' dues\n\n[Bridge]\nAin\u2019t no excuse for my failures\nMy success, no apologies\nAll that I own\nAbsolute honesty\nKeep it 100\nBut that\u2019s what they all say\n\n[Chorus]\nPull up in drop coupes\nHopped in them V12\u2019s\nWent from them mixtapes, shutdown retail\nSwitchin' my line nigga, she hittin' my Twitter, fool\nNiggas is sprung on pussy\nMe, I\u2019m just payin' dues"}], "artist": "Nipsey Hussle"}
