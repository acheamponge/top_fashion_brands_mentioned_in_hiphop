You know that. Shit just flew by. What am I really even doing? God, I know we rarely talk, but every day I wake up I feel like, I feel like I blew it with my family, with her. These kids around me don't have no one to look up to. Should have been me. This job ain't me, man. This ain't what I'm supposed to be doing in my life, man"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
