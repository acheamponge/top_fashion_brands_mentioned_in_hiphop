It's prolly 'cause I'm hot now\nBitch, you better leave me alone\nFirst, I cut you off, then I cut you down\nShit go off, when I come around\nI don't never come around\nBitch, I'm gettin' hunnits now\nI don't wanna stop now, I don't wanna stop now\nBut, I gotta leave it alone\nIs it 'cause I'm hot now? It's prolly 'cause I'm hot now\nBitch, you better leave me alone\nFirst, I cut you off, then I cut you down\nShit go off, when I come around\nShit go off, when I come around\nShit go off, when I come around\nShit go off, when I come around"}], "artist": "Lil Peep"}
