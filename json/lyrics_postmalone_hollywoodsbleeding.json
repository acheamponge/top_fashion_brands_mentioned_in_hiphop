I wonder\nI go out, and all they eyes on me\nI show out, do you like what you see?\nAnd now they closin' in on me\nLet 'em sharpen all they teeth\nThis is more than I can handle\nBlood in my Lambo'\nWish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope\nI light a candle, some Palo Santo\nFor all these demons, wish I could just go on\n\n[Chorus]\nI just keep on hopin' that you call me\nYou say you wanna see me, but you can't right now\nYou never took the time to get to know me\nWas scared of losin' somethin' that we never found\nWe're running out of reasons, but we can't let go\nYeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home", "year": "2019-09-06"}]}
