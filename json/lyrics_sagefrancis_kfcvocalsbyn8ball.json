My name's Nate, can I take your order?\nJust a large soda that's a dollar and a quarter\nCustomers come and go like seasons of the year\nFat paycheck at the end of the week's the reason why I'm here\n\nMix powder with water and it turns into gravy\nPour that all over your motherfucking food, we do the chicken right  baby\nServing more wedges than a rebel alliance\nFleet of X-Wings, honey barbecue rings\nCustomer complaint pierce my ear like a ring\n\nWe got all the secret spices and herbs, working for the Colonel\nPopcorn chicken, similar to popcorn, but it got no kernels\nHere's your cup and a straw\nNo skill lacking, ever customer service slacking\n\nKid you know I'm packing, coleslaw\nIf there's time to lean, then it's time to clean\nTeam KFC makes the barbecue beans\nThe boost spray and wipe down the window and doors\n\nDo my job keep from the firing squad\nM-O-P the floors\nSweep up the bathrooms clean the poop off the seat\nIn the bathroom shoot a few hoops with the leftover meat\nClock out for the night, it's the end of the day\nGrab a parfait as my employee meal and I'm on my way\n\n[Hook]\nButter for your biscuit, biscuit macaroni and cheese\nEverybody wants a little KFC\nCome down, buy a bucket, you'll get to meet me\nEverybody wants a little KFC\nFor only six bucks you can eat at the buffet\nEverybody wants a little KFC\nTender roast extra crispy original\nEverybody wants a little KFC\n\n[Repeat sample]", "album": null}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
