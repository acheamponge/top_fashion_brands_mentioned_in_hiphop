What Gil-Scott was hearing\nWhy all our heroes and heroines end up on heroin?\nCrack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland\nWe invested in that; it\u2019s like we got Merrill lynched\nAnd we been hanging from the same tree ever since\nSometimes I feel the music is the only medicine\nSo we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it\nThe fiends cop it; nowadays, they can\u2019t tell if\u2026\nThat\u2019s that good shit? We ain\u2019t sure, man\nPut the CD on your tongue; yeah, that\u2019s pure, man\n\n[Chorus]\nThat\u2019s that crack music\nThat real Black music\nLa la la la la la la la\nLa la la la la la\n\n[Verse 2]\nFrom the place where the fathers gone\nThe mothers is hardly home\nAnd the maric\u00f3ns lock us up in the Audy Home\nHow the Mexicans say? \u201cWe just trying to party, homes\u201d\nWho gave Saddam anthrax?\nGeorge Bush got the answers\nBack in the hood, it's a different type of chemical\nArm & Hammer baking soda; raised they whole quota\nRight when our soldiers ran for the stove 'cause\n'Cause\u2026 dreams of being Hova\nWent from being a broke man to being a dopeman\nTo being the President; look, there's hope man\nThis that inspiration for the Moes and the folks man\nShorty come and see his momma straight overdosing\nAnd this is the soundtrack\nThis the type of music that you make when you 'round that\nCrack music!"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
