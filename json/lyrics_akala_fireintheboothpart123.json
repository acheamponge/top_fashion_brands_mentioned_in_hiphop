Indian people\nWho owns our shit?\nSo we shake our arse and dance\nAs if racism just upped and vanished\nBut has it? No its right on course\nYou\u2019re beaten so bad, you\u2019re trained to ignore\nLet me not just make sweeping statements\nGimme a second, I\u2019ll explain it\nFor small amounts of drug possession there\u2019s more black people in jail in America than there is for rape and armed robbery and murder all put together\nYou can say they\u2019re just locking up thugs\nImagine if they locked up every middle class kid that had ever held drugs\nOh that\u2019s right, that\u2019d be your kids!\nBigger than that what is going on with this\nPrison in America\u2019s a private business\nThey get paid 50k per year per inmate by the State, just wait\u2026\nAlso legally are allowed to use their prison inmates as slaves\nCheap slave labour, big corporations\nThey come out of jail, can\u2019t get a job\nSo when we celebrate going to jail\nWe are LITERALLY CELEBRATING ENSLAVEMENT\nAdd to that, that the hood that you\u2019re livin\u2019\nEngineered social condition that breeds crime by design\nWhere do you think you get your nine?\nYou can say that they\u2019re just black\nBut I like to deal with facts\nIn the 1920s you would\u2019ve found in America\nBlack towns\nProspering centres of economics and education to make you proud\nBut some people couldn\u2019t bear that the former slaves would not just lie down\nSo the KKK and other hate groups burnt those towns to the ground\nKillin hundreds\nIf it ain\u2019t understood\nYou think you were always livin\u2019 in the hood?\nShit it\u2019s only been sixty years\nSince they hung blacks and burned em\u2019\nAnd that was so cool\nDay reel passes, picnic baskets\nEven gave kids the day off school\nTo go see a lynchin\u2019\nHave a picnic\nIt\u2019s fun to watch the little monkeys die\nThen people act a little dysfunctional\nYou wanna pretend that you don\u2019t know why\nIf your colour means you can be killed\nAnd you\u2019re powerless to get justice about it\nIs it difficult to figure out how you would then end up feelin\u2019 about it?\nAnd that ain\u2019t excuses\nJust dealing with the roots of abuses that make a reality\nWhere a generation of young men speak of ourselves as dirt casually\nThat\u2019s America\nThis Britain\nSome things are similar\nSome different\nIn this country the first enslaved were the working class\nWhat\u2019s changed?\nWorse jobs, worse conditions\nWorse taxes, look where you\u2019re livin\u2019\nYou go to the pub, Friday night\nYou will fight with a guy\nDon\u2019t know what for\nBut won\u2019t fight with a guy, suit and a tie\nWho sends your kids to die in a war\nThey don\u2019t send the kids of the richer politicians\nIt\u2019s your kids, the poor British\nThat they send to go die in a foreign land\nFor these wars you don\u2019t understand\nYeah they say that you\u2019re British\nAnd that lovely patriotism they feed ya\nBut in reality you have more in common with immigrants\nThan with your leaders\nI know, both side of my family\nBlack and white are fed ghetto mentality\nReality in this system\nPoor people are dirt regardless of shade\nBut with that said\nLet\u2019s not pretend that everything is the same\nWhen our grandparents came here to Britain\nIf you had a criminal record you couldn\u2019t get in\nYet that ain\u2019t protect them from all the stupid, stupid abuses they would be livin\u2019\nKicked in the teeth\nStabbed in the street\nMany times fired bombed our houses\nPut faeces through our letter box\nAnd of course the cops did so much about it(!)\nDaily, up to the 80s\nPeople spittin\u2019 into my pram cos\u2019 I was a coon baby\nBut of course that has had no effect on why today we are crazy\nAnd none of this was for any good reason\nThey were just dark and breathing\nTo ease the guilt now for all of this treatment\nConstant stereotypes are needed\nSo if I celebrate how big that my dick is\nBricks that I\u2019m flippin\u2019\nClips that I\u2019m stickin\u2019\nChicks that I\u2019m hittin\u2019\nI\u2019m playing my position\nBut if I teach a kid to be a mathematician\nMessin\u2019 with the schism\nHow they gonna fill a prison when materialism is nothing but a religion?\nWhat do you think we got now in Britain?\nJust like America, private prisons\nPrisons for profit!\nThat mean when your kids go jail people make money off it\nSo keep environments that breed crime\nBuild more jails at the same time\nMarket badness to the kids in the rhymes\nAs long as rich kids ain\u2019t dying its fine!\nGet em\u2019 to the point where some are so lost\nThey actually believe that if they don\u2019t celebrate killin\u2019 themselves off\nThat it\u2019s because they\u2019re soft\nWas Malcolm soft?\nWas Marley soft?\nTell me was Marcus Garvey soft?\nWell? Was Mohammed Ali soft?\nNah, Nah I think not!\nBut they want us to think that the road is cool\nBeing on road is all we can do\nWe don\u2019t control the wholesale productions\nWho benefits from us movin\u2019 the food?\nOr thinking there\u2019s no way out of road life\nBut Malcolm X used to hustle out on the roadside\nWhen Marcus Garvey organised more than 6 million people\nWith no Facebook or Twitter\nWhy is this something you cannot equal?\nShiiiiit!\nOne of my homeboys did a ten straight in the box in yard\nNow what\u2019s he doing?\nPassin\u2019 his doctorate\nDon\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s too hard!\nWho trained you to believe that you\u2019re inferior?\nSungbo Eredo in Nigeria are the remains of an ancient moat\nDug 1000 years ago\n20 metres wide, 70 down\nRound the remains of an ancient town\nThat\u2019s 400 square miles around\n400 square miles around\nPlease, please don\u2019t believe me\nIt was a documentary on BBC!\nBut we ain\u2019t studyin\u2019 history\nToo busy watching MTV\nAnd MTV said wear platinum\nNow everybody wanna go and wear platinum\nAnd MTV said pop magnums\nNow everybody wanna go and pop magnums\nIf MTV said drink prune juice\nYou would start hearing that in tunes soon\n\u2018Hey!

shit my head\u2019s still nappy\nThink for myself, still some mad at me\nBut on the mic ain\u2019t not one bad as me\nAll of this here\u2019s good for the rhymes\nPut us in the same place at the same time\nAnd it\u2019s clear to everybody that I\u2019m out of my mind\nSome of these guys are runnin\u2019 out of their rhymes\nClear to everybody that has got ears\nI\u2019m the guy that they just might fear\nThey wanna get near but they can\u2019t have a peer\nAh dear I\u2019m hard liquor you\u2019re just like beer\nFront on the kid for another five years\nCome to my shows and some cry tears\nIt mean that much to em\u2019, it\u2019s a movement!\nI don\u2019t speak for myself but a unit\nBlack, white, man, woman, anyone that respects truth we put in\nDudes are like no dinner with just puddin\u2019\nYeah you\u2019re sweet but no substance puddin\u2019\nYou could never ever be with a level on\nOur songs get out played out there in Lebanon\nWe speak for the people properly\nNot for the old fat guys in offices\nAnd the girls love him, it ain\u2019t fair\nHe can\u2019t even be bothered to comb his hair\nAnyway that\u2019s enough kissin\u2019 my own arse\nBack to the more important task of being so shower\nI got half the hood screaming \u201cKNOWLEDGE IS POWER\u201d\nAnd I ain\u2019t saying that will change rap\nBut I do know this for a fact\nRight now there\u2019s a yout\u2019 on your block\nWith his hands on his balls, face screwed up\nSwear he don\u2019t care, don\u2019t give a fuck\nThat he won\u2019t let nobody caught his block\nBut the words go in\nOpen up your chakra\nBecause once that\u2019s happened there\u2019s no going back\nOnce you start to see what is really happening\nWho the enemy you should be attackin\u2019 is\nSo READ, READ, READ!\nStuck on the block, READ, READ!\nSittin\u2019 in the box, READ, READ!\nDon\u2019t let them say what you can achieve\nCos when people are enslaved\nOne of the first things they do is stop them reading\nCos\u2019 it is well understood that intelligent people will take their freedom\nCos\u2019 if we knew our power we would understand that we can\u2019t be held down\nIf we knew our power, we would not elevate not one of these clowns\nIf we knew our power, we wouldn\u2019t get arrogant when we get two pennies\nIf we knew our power, we would see what everybody sees, that we\u2019re rich already!\nBut never mind MCs go run for your mummy\nI\u2019m hungry, I run for my tummy\nThat\u2019s enough, back to worshiping money\nI\u2019m off, back to the study!\n\n[Intro]\nYo, Akala\nKnowledge is power\nVolume 1, Mixtape 28th of may Listen\nAkala music.com\nTiny bit more vocal please actually\nListen, Knowledge is power always\nListen\n\n[Part 2]\nOi, Mate my personal life's great\nSome of you would love me more, If I rubbed that in you're face\nOkay, well\nLet us run down the resume and have a little chat about how Akala's living today\nBig whip, nice yard, Been all over the globe\nLook how many continents I have done, Shows\nCouple little company's, Neat little office\nEverything going swell, Little bit of profit\nBuilt a business educating kids from the blocks\nSo far as I'm concerned you gotta be a mug to not rate him\nOwn my masters, Still my own master\nNovels and scripts on the way\nRap is just a part of, The genius in his head\nAnd he knows it, Dickhead, Since I used to kick ball for West ham\nWith my bighead\nBack in school days wearing hand-me downs from my sister\nAnd gal' was still onto man, Now thats some ras charisma\nAs just a nippa, I took my first pull of Rizla\nAnd who you think gave me that? yeah my bigger sista\nSo when we speak of struggle cousin it's yours\nYou know the same old madness, working class poor\nYeah, So, may of won a couple awards\nBut I guarantee my family's just as messed up as yours\nAll the abuse and the alcoholism and drug addiction\nUncles going to prison\nThis is working class livin' in Britain, It ain't great\nYou gotta be kiddin'\nSo please don't ever get confused by me spittin'\nCos', yes I said the ghetto's in our head\nBut no I didn't mean that if you live next to a food yard that thats in your dreams\nI meant believing in the madness they spout about us\nIs far more dangerous than putting us in council houses\nSo yeah I criticize but from a place of love, never, ever\nBecause I think that I've become above\nEvery young broth, you wanna judge as a tug'\nIt's me minus a little guidance and love\nSo I think that your the mug\nAnd why be smug when it's an actual fact\nWe all commit crime, Simply by paying tax\nCos' we don't go and tickle the people in Iraq\nAnd ask them so politely for all their minerals we extract\nWe blew children's heads off, Set fire to backs\nWere a gangsta nation get down or you get clapped, so\nWhen you see the yout' running around on the road with heaters\nDon't be surprised, they're just copying their leaders\nLong as the wars stay in places that are brown and poor\nWe can all pretend to be Abhorred But we applaud\nIf you go up to Knightsbridge and get violent\nThe police man who duppies you will probably get knighted\nIf I don't wanna fight you cuz'\nIt ain't cos' I'm frightened\nIt's just rather fight with those who really think they're titans, shit\nI ain't scared of bleeding\nI ain't scared of breathing another breath in this world where everything is so uneven\nWhere millions murdered in the Congo and it's barely news\nBut if a footballers wife should buy a pair of shoes\nI'm supposed to give a fuck apparently, I do not\nThe worlds a reflection of you're block\nAnd if you think a world that profit from their death, and be totally cool\nAnd think you're better cos' you live here, your a bloody fool\nLook around the genocidal abuse\nI swear humanity ain't nothing but a virus with shoes\nThen I pick my nephew up from school, and I look at the youths\nAnd see the love that they show each other and I'm just so confused\nBecause they ain't learnt yet what is their race or religion\nSo we're put unconditioned but we learn to play our position\nIn the system\nLook what that does to our recognition of self\nWe grow suspicion of our own intuition, listen\nAkala's sick but he raps about racism to much\nCould you imagine I gave a flying f\nCos' it's amazing, how many wanna claim they love this music\nWith no respect for the actual struggle that produced it\nDid Hip-Hop not start in segregated hoods, are them hoods not still segregated?\nSo it's really good\nAnd the first nation not still on reservations where the age of 46\nIs the average life expectation\nAnd fellas, I wonder where the Favelas, could be suddenly knocked down\nAnd replaced with something better\nIf you got sense you see fights are joined in race class and\nGender are sides of the same coin\nSo, if you really down for justice whoever the people who suffered, whoever you are\nI consider you my sisters, brothers\nBut call it what it is like Carlin or Bill Hicks\nNot these patronizing left-wing little twits who ask me dumb shit\nOn the superior tip\nAnd wanna act like cos I read I saw less violence as a kid\nDon't make me an exception\nFor your mental protection\nFrom acceptin' the madness in the system we are left in\nThat was the clearest thing to come of august events\nAll the closet bigots started speaking their minds again\nSo when a Jamaican or Asians misbehavin' of course it's because of their skin\nBlonde hair kills a million people, thats just him\nAnd it's entertaining some people are so thick\nBut I prefer that to all of the fake grins\nCos' it's the only problem people claim they wanna solve but don't actually wanna talk about\nHow it evolved, You are told, this country really really yours sir?\nWhat they did to brown people they did to their own poor first\nAnd originally in the states, working class whites were also enslaved\nStill no one talks about it today\nEver since the master came with the system of privileged\nMade the working whites the overseers mulatto the house\nCos' put the darkest blacks in the field, that mind is with us still\nBillion dollar industry's, skin cream and bleaching pills\nAnd lets be honest most people of my complexion to this very day still think they're\nBetter than the darker section\nYou say it's changed then only educate me about Wilberforce not about the Africans in Haiti\nWho beat the army's of the British, Spanish and napoleon, From the moment it was stolen\nFrom em, There was no controllin' em\nWhen I was in school, she said no you never fought for freedom\nNo, we freed you and you were on your knees pleading\nAnd once more did you know that we kind of saved you from the barbarism of Africa\nYou should be grateful\nAnd enough of our own people can't be bothered to read\nThat they actually believe that we were swinging from trees\nThey don't know the kingdom of Congo had embassy's in Italy\n500 years ago, Literally\nAin't heard of Saint Maurice or Septimius Severus\nThey ain't studying the past cos' they think it's irrelevant\nAnd attempts of pretending ancient Egyptians weren't African\nNuttin' more than pseudo intellectual lies\nThey obviously ain't read what Aristotle and Herodotus said\nAbout people they saw for their own eyes and\nEgypt's been invaded since the fall of the pharaoh's\nNot once, Not twice, But many many times\nAnd nobody wants to explain why so many statues are missin' noses\nEven when those statues made of granite\nIt ain't one people alone, mis-taught about themselves\nWe live on Celtic land, But don't learn about the Celts\nThe same, Irish people you characterize as stupid\nDuring the dark ages some of the most educated living in Europe\nAnd did you learn the numbers you count with every day\nWere invented by Indian people, I bet you didn't\nOr how many million Indians fought for Britain in both world wars\nStill you got the cheek to call them immigrants\nWe don't learn about the Moors of course, for some that knowledge dangerous\nIs it a problem the impact they had on the Renaissance?\nWhen people take power over another group\nWe minimize their achievements so we can make it feel true\nSo if you think Columbus was first to sail ocean blue\nYou probably believe Elvis invented Rock & Roll too\nAnd oh, for the record no doubt I believe in peace\nBut not for one second will I turn the other cheek\nThey slap you, slap them back and take teeth\nThe only way a bully ever learn is getting beat\nFight, fire with fire nah fire with water\nSee the life you enforce is stronger than the destroyer\nThat's why these MC's can't speak to me\nNO, All men are not made equally\nMy brains made of iron fiber, conductin' the livest wire\nMy average grades higher than Oxford and Cambridge require\nI don't want credit, because I got a message\nI want credit cos' I'm the best MC\nDead it\nWhen I came out way back in 04\nSister had just won every award\nMost man would have done the bait thing\nPut big sis on the chorus chords\nThat would of been a-list sure\nQuickly I would of been famous more\nBut look how I came in this ting' raw\nBang of the streets and more\nIf I MC'd and I heard me rap i'd be like what the\nI ain't never gonna' be that good so\nI better not push my luck\nIt will embarrass me\nOnly insanity, Would make you challenge me\nBetter hope if we bump heads, that day that I fee like charity\nIf not it's a beating and ain't no use in searching for meaning\nCuz all it means is that you are crap and I am a genius\nWait I'm Panama I'll push the parameter\nCan you imagine a Pharaoh more sicker than average\nI'll kill them with character\nBenjamin Banneker\nLook at the marriage of stamina\nDamage ya\nBoy from Britannica\nGot love from the whole in the calendar, so cold that I roll in a Challenger\nWhile you men roll with the amateurs\nI'm too much harder\nYou can just call him Father Akala\nBut I don't talk shit like a pastor\nMany know that I'm smarter than Arthur\nBloody disaster\nFire astarter\nProbably prodigy\nMake you a martyr\nFor these crap MC's that mumble\nThen see me in the flesh and crumble\nWhoever told you that I was humble\nNo I'm not, Don't lie\nI'm so sure with my writing ability\nThat I feel like I'm finding divinity\nSit down and every rhyme a soliloquy\nMy agility, timing is Military\nWhat scene? get a Guillotine for the Mini-me\nIt seems ya'll fiend for the the mimicry\nYour team couldn't dream of this synygy\nThat I be when I scheme on a wicked beat\nThere he goes again with the big words, bare syllables\nGet your dictionaries out\nThat's what I'm about\nClowns wanna shout\nThrash him, smash him in the mouth\nBloody professor\nMan of the letter\nI've read and I've read and I'm sure that I'm better\nNever regretting the endeavor to dead an oppressor\nI think that they're lepers that think that their pleasures are better endeavors\nDon't know about precious but\nSee me? born in a rage\nMaroon blood, coursing my veins\nAs you can see I was born for the stage\nBut, I'll never be their cultural maid\nSome say that we're political\nCos' what they're doing isn't\nDon't they preach a political doctrine called materialism\nBut, for all the Italian clothes that you wear\nOr German cars that you drive\nOr french Champagne that we buy\nWe'll still be monkeys in their eyes\nSo why you are beggin' it\nWho knows, Italians fight to wear Jamaican clothes?\nItalians call their own women hoes?\nFor everyone's entertainment bro?\nBut hey, what do I know\nI'm just the one with the coldest flows\nAll over the globe baddin' down shows\nBut still don't oil my chest and pose\nPose a threat to the power structure\nNot because we're anything special\nBut because were the people together\nAnd that's the only way things changin'. EVER\n\n[Hook] x2\nAbsolute power corrupts absolutely\nBut absolute powerlessness does the same\nIt's not the poverty\nIt's the inequality we live in everyday that will turn us insane\nWe live in everyday\nYo, Listen\n\nIn a scheme of livin' my life wasn't hard\nBut as far as Britain goes sh't i practically starved\nSleepin' in a track suit, gas meter runnin' out\nElectric cut of as well, candles lighting up the house\nLookin' in my mother's eyes I see how she feels\nThe strain and the pain of just paying bills\nIt ain't real and that's how i grow like so many more\nAnd i was part of who i am\nI am very sure\nYou wanna' know the rage i feel in my stomach\nKnowing my mom and dad split up when i was still in her stomach\nAnd not everything that happened i will put in 16's\nBut i will tell you enough so you know what i mean\nMy boy's mother got cancer the same time as mine\nBut his mother died and mine survived\nIt was crazy back then\nWhen i was like 10 already had the mental strength\nMore than many grown men\nIt was a couple of years after my step dad left\nDid he really know all the crazy mess he left\nBecause mum done recovered from the lumps in her neck\nBut being poor and alone couldn't cope with the stress\nHer and my big sis for\nSo much so, that I hadn\u2019t left school\nWhen she left home\nI was 13 by now still a little kid, innocent\nNext couple year though would turn 'to a militant\nThat is the result of no food in the fridge\nAnd every other day you gettin' searched by the pig's\nPlus these patronizing teacher doe' my grade sick\nTrying to emasculate me yeah turn me into a f'cking ana\nDon't mean no woman please let me be clear\nI mean been a spineless man because what do they fear\nMore than the working class brown male with a brain\nAnd when our energy is harness everything changed\nLook at 'Pac, look a Marley, look at Hendrix, look at Garvey\nThis is the potential that is wasted on a daily basis\nA racist classist world that we live in\nStill we comin' from nothing and we educating millions\nI see why it scares you its like how dare you\nOvercoming the obstacle that we have been careful to\nPlace in your way, every step of the way\nIn this so called democracy were kids get sprayed\nBlack and the Asians, Turks and the Chavs\nCrowded in council flats, living like ants\nAnd who's more confused than so called white trash\nTalking this madness about they want there country back\nIt never was yours, you should read more\nWhat they did brown people they did to the own poor\nBut people's memory short so much that i'm seeing\nBlack and Asian kids cast eastern-European\nNo pot to piss in, makes competition\nI fail to see how this is a effective system\nWhen cats and dogs in America and Britain\nEat better food than most of humanity\nAnd we spend our technology only on killing\nHow is this more than sophisticated savagery\nIt was once said the world is a stage\nEach persons is just a actor with a part to play\nLike the middle class kids and the kids of the rich\nThat have everything but yet still pissed and on coke and ketamine strong hat on\nI ain't generalizing look at the evidence\nSo go to Glastonbury any year\nYou will see but unlike carnival it won't be crowing with police\nThis is London the kids on the very next street\nHad a very different life experience from me\nAnd in my experience the can't help but be smug\nAfter lifetime of what they think is just good luck\nBut still more anxious and more thankless\nUnearned privileges ways like an anchor\nIt's why they copy what we do, tyna' be what they not\nThey will grow up though and get better jobs\nAnd maintain the system that they claim they hated\nThey can't fight against it, they got a stake in this matrix\nHip-Hop is just a fad to them, you didn't know\nBut for us this is our living breathing soul\nAnd yeah they might back pack in South America\nOr even volunteer in a African Village\nBut all said and done, when push come to shove\nAnd shit hits the fan they're middle class and British and i ain't even dissing\nThat's just how it is most rich brown people just as full of sh't\nSo much more concerned with our cars and jewels\nThat most of the world poor luck just like you\nSo much more concerned being privileged few\nAnd who knows maybe me to\n\n[Hook]\n\nKnowledge is Power!!!!!\n\n[Part 3]\n\nWhoever's more human must have the right to do the abusing\nI imagine that means you then\nOr are you men just as clueless\nFoolish fools, thoughts of a tortured soul\nBought for a quarter of gold\nOne little sand nigga slaughter it whole\nWhy not? They don't have souls\nThey love their children less than we do so they are less than equal\nThey abuse women so we kill them cos they are bloody villains\nThat's right, we are the feminists\nFor the women of the world, kill terrorists\nLiberate them from their burqas\nThey feel more free with their children murdered\nI know that it sounds absurd but lemme explain it a little bit further\nWe're so superior our missiles whistle until they tickle\nLittle itty bitty grandchildren and make them giggle\nBut their laughter sounds like screaming I told you that they were demons\n\nThey pretend to be dead to make us feel sad\nPut bullets in their head to make us look bad\nBut we're never anything other than glad\nWhen those that look funny end up in a body bag\nBut if a hair is harmed on Sally or Brad or\nEven a dog we cry like mad\nA dog is a man's best friend, not a girl\nWomen are abused all over the world and children are raped\nEvery place, every religion or creed or race\nEven fathers with daughters, uncles with nieces sweep it under the carpet\nRape is a weapon used by power, and we don't wanna look like bastards\nSo manufacture hero complex, a reaction to nuttin' more complex\nTo organise mass rape of the state, don't wanna hear about mass graves\nCos I hate to relate to a shade that's darker than you\nOne that prays under a different roof\nHas less dollars or pounds, crowns or gowns or crowns\nFill 'em up with rounds\nIf they mess with the way that things are constructed\nObstructing lines of production\nYou can buy anything, liposuction, seduction, just buy it from us, men\n\nBuy lies, can't buy truth\nNo-one's selling it there is no use\nThere is no customer base for the product\nWe'd rather buy some celebrity trollop\nCos our life is about getting one-up\nOn everybody else that we pass on a come up\nWe don't care what force bring the sun up\nBut lie in the sun every day gettin' bun up\nLie to the point that it's part of the culture\nTell the truth it's only the result of\nA double lie\nCancelling itself, their pride cancer in itself\nCos virus is normality living in a world that is built on vanity\nMore salaries, more calories, more thieving, more charities\nPicture a Moor on a horse with a chariot speaking some kind of African Arabic\nTeaching mathematics with Spaniard when maths had not got to Britannia\nCan you picture mind scripture\nThats designed for the mind to enrich you\nAre you blind can't you find the riddim pratt?\nCause your timing alignment is on crack\nIt's hard to be as far off the rhythm as you are, it's like art\nHard to have so little charisma, I swear that you try to be shit\nTo make me look even better than\nEverybody knows that I am already\nI'm a pedigree that can't be touched like leprosy\nHave a rapper like The Beatles begging me to let it be\nAnd I don't need no referee\nI play the game on my own, it's my own sport\nAnd you can't take a king to his own court\nYou can't take a king to his own court\nYou ain't the throne sort\nYou're the type to rap for five minutes\nAnd complain your throat's sore\nWhile I'm so sure that my stone jaw\nIs the coldest on road since '04\nBut these silly little boys think their so raw\nMake a bigger bit a noise but we know you're\n\nYou ain't up the game, you ain't match fit\nYou ain't even got the brain for the tactics\nYou ain't even on the bench you're a ballboy\nOne lickle send out yout so just sit down\nI am the Big Mic man with the crown\nSuper cat de pon sting with the sound\nWho are these silly little\nWollies?\nThink they erupt with enough of the guts to be on it\nTheir the version of me that I didn't wanna be\nI'm the coldest I wrote since Admiral Zheng He\nI'm the fire in the booth, you a wet rag\nYou ain't the real ting like a step-dad\nI'm the best so rest where the rest have\nDon't big up your chest, let your breasts sag\nI'm the best dad look, I don't even beat my sons\nI let them shine\nEven when they got no talent to rhyme\nInsist on doing it all of the time\nAll of my spine is re-enforced with a kind\nOf carbon that hardens the thoughts in my mind\nOf course you will find that I torture a line\nI'm born with bars, no-one ever taught me to rhyme\nThe portion that's mine, don't touch it\nFurthermore, don't even discuss it\nI know that you heard\n\nBritain's biggest export is weapons of death\nThat ain't a theory or a guess\nTake another breath and your country is next\nUnless you remind 'em whenever you're rhyming\nYou're a beast on the mic with impeccable timing\nThey will think you're in the league that I'm in\nBut that is most absurd\n\nI Turn a Stanza to a cancer with banter\nFor those between the gangster and a panther\nI know you seen me these man dem with their tantrums\nLike kids when I'm off on a tandem\nCos they don't know what a tandem means\nSo rather than use a dictionary they talk shit and badmouth me\nWhen I'm only tryina elevate your mind, G\nBut I don't watch that the love is more than a grands worth\nYou should see when I roll through Handsworth\nElders see me, cross the road, talk to me and it usually goes\nWe love how you bus up da ting, spread knowledge\nBunfire pon them Babylon college\nWe salute you, you're the future\nAll the bigger man have time for them yout deh\nWhat I'm saying it that the respect's worth\nMore than the chain on your neck\nWhen it's not that it's somebody's mum\nSaying that she feed me to her son\nCos she wanna come get his mind out of the slums\nAkala is smarter than Arthur your dumb\nRegardless the bars are retiredly dumb\nWhat the raises and the raated a part of my lung\n\nTake out a whole clique that chat's do do\nPic up a mic, we can see who's who\nI'm fire in the booth, you dry wood\nYour flesh best taste quite good\nSo smart but he still move quite hood\nSee him on the road but don't think that I try should\nThat's a wise assessment, kind of like land is a wise investment\nEspecially land that's recently blessed with\nIn excess of one million deaths in\nAnd the castle you rest in, that's a next ting\nBuilt on the bones and the flesh of the wretched\nThrone that you pose in, only protected\nCos we regret that only deceptive\nThings that we like, and only reject it\nWhen it feels like it's truth were digesting\nSo\nGet in with a blessed king\nWhose crown is the rounds that he fought\nTherefore you ain't gotta deal with the fraud\nOf all these picanees of whom I'm bored\n\nMy worst, stronger than their best\nAura alone stronger than their flesh\nAll that they known can't compare to his guess\nUsually don't ever dare to spit next\nIt's clear the reason is fear\nEven the worst MC has ears\nBut we can't hear where the beat is\nThe time is his flow with the kick and the snare\nWhen they hear me they know life ain't fair\nGod bless some and some get air\nLike these conscious heads that cry\nThat I get big headed and I don't know why\nCos I, I have always been this guy\nEver since mum sent for the sky\nI decided that that was too low\nSo I'm astral travelling to another zone\nYou won't ever get on the dog and the bone\nCos I don't ever really wanna answer my phone\nZone that I'm in is high vibration\nSee the future with mind meditation\nYour peeps, poor libation\nFor all the peeps that get above their station\nI place them in the right placement\nThat is to say I erase them\n\nAin't no-one above nor adjacent\nStill these mugs they want to get feisty\nBut face it they don't really wanna face me\nI don't run so you can't ever chase me\nAnd I been through tings on the pavement\nBut don't beg road fame cos I never made it\nMy uncles, cousins and friends have done everything that yours have mate\nBut I don't tell their story I tell mine\nThat means I'm real and you're fake\nThat said, I don't mind a bit of fiction\nIf you did tell your story well\nBut your raps are dryer than a dead man's top lip\nAfter six years of living in hell\nYou meet a nice girl, you just might gel\nMight be wifey, you can't quite tell\nYou know why? Cos the only bitch in the world\nIs a man and his ego he hides in a shell\nMine is harder than my uncles foot back\nWho don't even need to wear shoes\n\nWho only eats pounded yam and stew\nWith hands like a can on a man, I refuse\nWho said mum never raised no fools, your mum raised you\nYou're a plonker, a plank, a donut, a tool\nYou make me think that mother nature's cruel\nThen I get back and remember\nLife is a gift even when it don't look like it is\nAnd everybody thinks that they're cold in a booth\nGot no friends to show them the truth\nPut the pen down, become a spectator\nGo get a day job, there is no shame in it\nWe need doctors and architects\nNot more crap rappers that are passed their best\nAnd if the cap fits you wear it\nIf it fits your friend too share it\nI know it ain't the role of a parent\nTo take my child's confidence and tear it\nBut it is my role as a father\nTo show my son about life and it's harder\n\nWhen you got a dad named Akala\nThose are big shoes to fill, be your own man\nHave you own plan, your own destiny\nJust don't ever mess with me\nPreferably bun these fools for their treachery\nDefinitely those that put us in jeopardy\nEspecially foes that wanna pose next to me\nNobody ain't testing me\nIt's the versatility that is killing them\nSo road but I teach kids William\nListen to my albums I actually write songs\nAnd of course the bars are brilliant\nWe can do politics, spirituality\nOr real life road reality\nOr do this ting here with straight up vanity\nEither way, nobody can't battle me\nMuch less shackle me, the maroon\nOne man army, an entire platoon\nThey're like \"won't he run out of breath soon?\"\n\"How does he do that? Is he human?\"\n\nLook man, it's the spirit of boukman\nBack in the flesh in a terrible crook man\nThe law won't like me, ain't it obvious\nI ain't a paedophile, now a colonist\nI'm the MC that you don't wanna bother with\nTo gauntlet is thrown down, who's crossing it\nHmm, that's what I thought\nYou can have your whole life to retort\nStill won't think up the things that I thought\nWhen I was age four\nStrach that before I was born\nIn the womb when I was yet to be formed\nBefore that in a past incarnation\nWhen I set fire to a thieves plantation\nMe and Sam Sharpe hid in the cane fields\nTwo weeks straight totally stayed still\n\nWith nothing but a blade of great steel\nJumped on our enemies what a great kill\nSelf defence is not violence it's common sense\nThe first rule of nature, self preservation\nTo let people kill and abuse you is just self hatred\nTurn the other cheek, why?\nNo-one ever got their freedom that way, lies\nWhen the oppressed say an eye for an eye\nThey talk this crap about the world goes blind\nJust don't attack us in the first place\nAnd everything will be just fine\nIn the mean time train hard\nRead nuff, stay sharp\nAnd don't diss the sisters, are you barmy?\nYou are putting down half your army\n\nAny evolution without the women in the middle is no revolution at all\nTrust me you could be back through them all\nWomen were there ready to pop tools\nBut we have become so cowardly that\nRather than fight back we attack\nThe only ones that ever had our back\nAnd that is a actual fact\nAnd I ain't saying that I ain't ever done that\nI'm just saying that it's time that we bun that\nSo don't put my name in the same sentence\nAs real revolutionaries, I'm offended\nReal revolutionaries spend their life engaged in revolutionary acts\nAnd as cold as I am on the mic\nThus far, I just rap\n\nThat said there is no comparison\nTo cold for the way that I carry on\nThese vultures feed off carrion\nCome along now, carry on, carry on\nRoll up roll up, two for a pound\nBun down MC's bun whole sound\nBun your whole clique I bun the whole town\nTake a stroll at the speed of sound\nWho said the speed of light was the fastest thing\nNever knew the speed of darkness\nA black hole absorbs all light that there is\nSo how could light ever get past it?\nI studied the masters and sages\nSecret teachings of all of the ages\nI don't know, I can't explain it\nThe knowledge ain't mine yet I radiate it\nIt's why they write sixteen lines\nAnd I write an essay that rhymes\nAnd I never went uni neither\nBut my mind works just fine\n\nIn fact no need to be modest\nMy mind's a fine instrument If I'm honest\nAnd I promise that I'll show you where the bodies at\nBurying MC's my lickle hobby that\nAnd MC's don't bite me\nThey ain't got the technique to even copy that\nI think I made my point\nIn a manner that is more than adequate\nLet's put all the boasting aside\nI do know that I'm just channeling\nThis thing, what is it?\nInspiration, the source of the spirit?\nNot a man in the sky\nBut a force that animates all things that are living\nDali's brush, Akala's lyrics all things\nAin't explained by the laws of physics\nCos you've been down on your life\nDon't mean you'll ever be on top of it\nCos for this force right here\nThere ain't one that is equal and opposite", "year": "2013-07-01", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/3222ca5815132f2ac56b73bacb186bf1.1000x672x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
