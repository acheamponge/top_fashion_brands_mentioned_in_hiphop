(AAAAH)\nYour gonna work that sandwich off now (I need marshmallows!)\nYeah lets fuckin go\n20 more miles, lets go you fat fuck\n(AH MARSHMALLOWS, GIVE IT TO ME)\nYou motherfucker, you, fuck you!\n\n[Verse 2]\nFrom philly cheesesteaks, lobsters on the barbeque\nI\u2019m getting twisted eating chicken with a prostitute\nAn hour later eat the burger with my drug dealer\nThen add the butter to the fudge to make the fudge realer\nEvery five minutes look in the fridges as if magic happened\nSneak a cookie, rip the bag, and fix the plastic wrapping\nI don\u2019t want know one to know that I took it\nCause I'm an over-eater (Ay yo ock, ay yo ock, fry the mayonnaise for me, man)\nLife is a smorgasbord to me and I\u2019ma over do it\nI wanna wear Italian clothing but it just don\u2019t cut it\nNot the type that show the package with the crystal studded\nThe shit they model in Milan that\u2019s looking crispy custom\n5 and 6 bitches, lickin\u2019 my dick twitches\nServe up a facial, Mister Belding, bitches dismiss \u2018em\nFor now I\u2019ll take what I can get till this shit switches\nWhatever fuck you stupid bitch\nPeace to the Drums of Heaven\nPeace to beef ribs\nExtended lunch time I eat enough for three kids\nGo on a diet, then fall off because I\u2019m weak kid\nSince I was young I\u2019m eatin\u2019 candy on the sneak tip\nMy day is based upon fine drugs, cholesterol\nThough at my height and weight im probably still the best at ball\nI\u2019m tatted up, I have no shame to show the chest at all\nI bet I have your lady humming on my testicles\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, Bronsolino\nBout to be fuckin, summer time in the winter\nShirtless", "title": "Ronnie Coleman", "album": "Dr. Lecter", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9b10376fe5cc5f697702488523dba2cd.580x521x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
