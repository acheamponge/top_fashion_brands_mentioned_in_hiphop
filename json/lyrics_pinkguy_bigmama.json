None, zip, nada\nRun from policia, ain't no drama\nFresh new Adidas for the newborn stamina\nFlow so purdy, I would turn around and fuck it\nAsian girl screams, that's a Bangkok Ruckus\nNot a crack-pipe, but I crack pipe, vocally\nPipe kids down with the black cane, locally\nGot a thick layer of bullshit that covers me\nSpying on your girl from a tree like Discovery Channel\nBust through your girl's vag' canal\nFuck her in the ass, less humps than a camel\nYo, riddle this fictitious little kiddle that rinse dishes\nBlow kisses to bad girls, they flinch itches\nMad sketchy like Craigslist, ain't shit\nY'all finish short, like a midget at the races\nWhen I'm on the beat, I'm something like a cypher\nPodium possess pig, keep it old-school, like a typewriter\nNight-rides a horse, well, I'm a knight rider\nSomething like a king bombing all these Al-Quaders (Bitch)\nNo, I'm just scanning the thin line\nBetween a piece of shit and a battle of ill minds\nI got dumb people that be testing my rhymes\nBut I can bend around the process and be steadily inclined\nSo when they ask, \"Who am I?\"\nMake a death slow and they feel the pain\nAnd when I'm not on my pill\nMy brain deteriorates and I go insane", "year": "2013-03-08"}]}
