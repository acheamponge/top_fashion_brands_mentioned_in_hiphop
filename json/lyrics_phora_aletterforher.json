I can see you glow\nYou just gotta give it some time for your wings to grow\nI love you, I just wanna see the best for you\nSo keep your head up & don't let nobody get to you\nMe & you been through so much you like my bestfriend\nI guess we don't get along cause we both nuts\nBut if anybody fuck wit you, & I happenn to run into em\nBest believe they'll get their fucking throat cut\nI ain't even the typa person to start shit\nBut I can feel your pain when you go through those hardships\nCause your pain is my pain\nEverytime I hear you doing bad, I seem to get these migraines\nI think we got the same mindframe & I swear on everything I love your blood running through my veins\n& I swear on everything I love your blood runnin through my veins\nI think I'll call you today & settle our differences\nLord knows I love my lil sis", "year": null}]}
