Why are they both in the same song?\nI don't know but I've been told\nHip hop music soothes the soul\n\nOn point 'cuz we keep it in the pole position\nWe've been trying to keep it cool like air conditioning\nGot a handful of cards but I'm sick of playing\nThese cats try hard but don't hear what I'm saying\n\nRun for cover, if you're on the wall then get off it\nGet this thing shaking like a mosh pit\nJesus, the first and last word of my thesis\nWe cruise like V6 shift\n\nHe's the rock of ages, peep this\nHe even cracked the code of the Matrix\nAnd I got my reasons\nYou can ask Harrison Ford what lies beneath us\n\nI am what I am when it all comes down\nYou know it's a warning when you hear that sound\nThey run for cover in the shelter now Y-O\n\nI am what I am when it all comes down\nYou know it's a warning when you hear that sound\nThey run for cover in the shelter now Y-O\n\nThere's not enough ways to say Jesus so I flipped it\nGot Thousand Foot Krutch on the track and remixed it\nNow it's the same Jesus now, just in case you missed it\nWell, the name Jesus stays on my mouth like some lipstick\n\nSo I flipped it man, I think the world's gone nuts\nSo I drop rhymes longer than lines at Starbucks\nNow Jesus is trendy kind of like Von Dutch\nBut that's more messed up than Donald Trump's haircuts\n\nNow hold up he got sold out like it was Ebay\nThen beat down and scratched up like a DJ\nThen they threw his body in the tomb for like three days\nBut then he came back kind of like instant replay\n\nBut it's Jesus the only one that I'm just speaking\nHe won't cost a thing like free nights and weekends\nCheck the tomb, you're gonna find a body missing\nAnd that's a reality show you won't find on television but\n\nI am what I am when it all comes down\nYou know it's a warning when you hear that sound\nThey run for cover in the shelter now Y-O\n\nI am what I am when it all comes down\nYou know it's a warning when you hear that sound\nThey run for cover in the shelter now Y-O\n\nBy now you know the deal with a crown of thorns\nHe died as the king on the hill\nAnd it's time you recognize exactly what is real\nMan I got Jesus, I don't need Doctor Phil\n\nBut for realla He just became the blood spiller\nHe's all I need the Prince of Peace and my healer\nShe carried the child when the Holy Spirit filled her\nThere's something about Mary but not the one with Ben Stiller\n\nIt's Jesus hopefully now you get it\nI got saved like the movie with Mandy Moore in it\nAnd it's, uh, Jesus is who I represent\nGeorge Bush is cool but I nominate Him for president\n\nI am what I am when it all comes down\nYou know it's a warning when you hear that sound\nThey run for cover in the shelter now Y-O\n\nI am what I am when it all comes down\nYou know it's a warning when you hear that sound\nThey run for cover in the shelter now Y-O"}]}
