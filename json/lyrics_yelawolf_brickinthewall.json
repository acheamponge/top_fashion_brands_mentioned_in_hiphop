(Hey!)\nI'm terrific actually; doing ok\nUsually irritated by what people say\nI'm doing better cause my radio don't play\n(Your radio don't play?)\nNope, guess it fell apart with\nHeartless music or useless artists\nDon't be a tool or a target\nHey be a fruit for the harvest\nThat's right: oranges, grapes not lemons\nBe smart, articulate your rhythm\nInstead of creating, they giving\nSounds that go to imitate theses children\nTrends become laughable at times\nFollow and become laughable in your lines (Idea!)\nY'all are so wrong\nStraighten up mister\n\n[Hook]\n(Leave them kids alone)\nAnd the beat goes on\nTalent switched off but the ego's on\n(All and all its just another brick in the wall)\nWell people dying to ball\nBut they ain't trying at all\nThey just lying to y'all\nAnd the truth is\n(All and all you're just another brick in the wall)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow many Chucks can a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood\nWell if you give Chuck a buck he'll buy wood pre-cut\nHard work, Chuck ain't used to it\nChuck's daddy got a caddy\nCause he used to work the alley\nChucking wood daily for the fiends\nBought a home with a yard\nChuck seems thawed\nNow he's living out daddy's dream\nSo many lames like Chuck fucking hip-hop up\nHip-hop's not dead, its just frozen and crushed\nWith diamonds and such\nWith labanous sluts\nBabbling bought what?\nI don't even know what\nI don't even hold much rap shit; I'm gone\nMore likely I move with rappers who ain't on\nI'm clapping for the songs they diss before long\nThey dig this shit, man, I just\n\n[Hook]\n(Leave them kids alone)\nAnd the beat goes on\nTalent switched off but the ego's on\n(All and all its just another brick in the wall)\nWell people dying to ball\nBut they ain't trying at all\nThey just lying to y'all\nAnd the truth is\n(All and all you're just another brick in the wall)\n\n[Interlude]\nIt's that time! Wake up!\nHoller at G!\nOh, he got 'em!\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm Catfish Billy and I feel so clean\nCause my music's fresh and so is my team\nI flow with this heat but I ain't blowing no steam\nI'm keeping this train moving\nHow I'm proving to be valuable to two or three\nAnd I'm proven to me\nHonestly I'm a breeze\nCause what I say on my piece\nIs a piece of my world\nThis is culture I'm giving to you\nListen!\nAnd these bitches on this new wave shit\nBut they wave white flags when the melee hits\nWhen they say hits, ain't no classics\nAin't no last dibs cause they done did that, pimp\nDetonate that roll\nAin't no milk in the bowl\nFeeling like you wanna laugh, ha, give it a go!\nYou're inviting little homies and you're 40-years-old?\nGo jump off a building, Superman that, ho\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Brick in the Wall"}]}
