Let my girl, girl go\nI try to be tough y'all\nSometimes she make me so mad\nHer eyes diamonds\nMake me forget she's so bad\nShe's my angel\nThis world she's not of\nSent from the upstairs\nTaught me that new kind of love (Love, love, love)\nI can't tell y'all\nWhat she means in my life\nWhat make it so crazy\nI met her through my wife\nShe got me locked down\nGot me locked, locked down\n\n(Chorus)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/76048d37e73e3e383749923c401de4f0.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Born to Reign", "title": "Willow is a Player"}]}
