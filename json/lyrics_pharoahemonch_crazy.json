Drop!)\nThirteen! You know the X is for anonymous\nFeels like I'm in the prime of my life but not Rodimus\n\n[Refrain]\n'Cause radio can suck my dick\nAnd Wall Street can lick my balls\n'Cause it's all about the 1%, let it burn\nLet it fall to the ground, just get up to get down and go crazy\n\n[Chorus]\nYea\nCrazy\nWe gon' what?!\nWe gon' rock it all night and all day and get crazy\nYea\nCrazy\n\n[Bridge]\nDeleted scenes of American dreams blurred\nI'm the American dream deferred\nAnd I do not have any fucks to give\nSo get them hands up, let's live\nYou are now rocking with the phenom phenomenal\nOriginal indigenous Geronimo\nSo hiyya hiyya heyy\nWe gon' rock it all night and all day\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wanna kidnap every rapper that's rapping over this trap shit\nSlap him in a contraption and smack him 'til he's collapsing\nSpecially these backward rappers from New York who be acting like they're immaculate with the raps but don't really be living the trapping life\nRemove his organs then utilize as a sacrifice\nNow ya favorite rapper's a mutilated hermaphrodite\nSaved him like a pastor then booted him to the afterlife\nExecuted, electrocuted him with a catheter\nAttach it to back of a battery then blasted via satellite\nAnd let the whole wide world witness\nThe gradual decapitation of a rapper with an exact-o knife\nThe massive massacre of actors that aren't acting right\n\n[Refrain]\n'Cause radio can suck my dick\nAnd Wall Street can lick my balls\n'Cause it's all about the 1%, let it burn\nLet it fall to the ground, just get up to get down and go crazy\n\n[Chorus]\nYea\nCrazy\nWe gon' what?!\nWe gon' rock it all night and all day and get crazy\nYea\nCrazy", "year": "2018-11-09"}]}
