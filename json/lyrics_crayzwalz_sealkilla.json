Why, motherfucker, why?\nI want an answer for cancer.  The plague was AIDS\nHepatitis B, ultraviolet death rays\nInsect sprays.  Bugs in your house, slugs route\nHate in your blood, fake love in your mouth\nRecycle paper, burn trees, catch the vapors\nOr the zap\u2019s on low\u2014smoke most space invaders\nIn a cloak and dagger, rape paradise\u2014broken ladder\nStolen laughter, omen scatter, choke and stagger\nRunning like r\u014dnins zoning.  Save your breath\nThe truth hurts\u2014$7 a box\u2014pay for death\nWith so much shame and anguish, it ain\u2019t strange\nFrames my language.  Painkiller skiller stretch rap famous\nBetween jail and ginseng, rap and rape\nKeep jamming with secret shaman slamming gates\nBlame the monkey, frame a junky, shame the country\nHomeless bastard\u2014I\u2019m afraid we funky\nIgnorance is the first form of comedy\nThe others form of slattery\u2014negativity\u2019s anatomy\nPositively think we gotta crawl with ya songs\nI\u2019m gone\u2014antigravity!\nLost your marbles\u2014had to find your scruple\n\u201cToo much teachers, not enough pupils!\u201d  My comments futile\nEverything I trust in has been crushed and killed\nNow I believe in dirt, disgusting filth\nRide the spice with inspire to write\n\u2018Cause in the end, the ribs won\u2019t describe your life (Nope)\nAnd the chain won\u2019t confide your wife or school your kids, right?\nHard to put jewels in your wigs\nIt\u2019s nothing to put the tool to your ribs\n\n[Hook One: Malcolm Bix] (x3)\nMy mother kill seal\n\n[Hook Two: 4th Pyramid]\nSeal killer.  We\u2019re iller\nFeel thriller.  Seal killer\nSeal killer.  We\u2019re iller\nReal thriller.  Seal killer\n\n[Bridge: C-Rayz Walz and Malcolm Bix]\nThe dream gotta go?  Then we gotta go and if the\nPlants gotta go?  Then we gotta go and if the\nWater gotta go?  Then we gotta go and if the\nSeals gotta go?  Then you know we gotta go\n\n[Verse 2: 4th Pyramid]\nDon\u2019t ignore this.  Pissing on portraits\nWith more hits, it\u2019s morbid.  Cheers to that\nBeers and rap.  Waiting for the day\nThe owner of Sears is black (Yes, yes)\nMere mortals fearing cats.  Governments steering traps\nWho to trust?  Talk shit, you a butt\nGot a gat?  You soon to bust\nThe lot of ya consumer sluts don\u2019t give a fuck\nWho discuss and choose the Lord?\nActing rude and stuff\u2014you know the rudish bluff\nBeat the dick, get some dough, treat the chick\nSome dro leaves to lip.  Get off that fiendish shit\nBreathing sick.  Recite daily, \u201cI believe I live\u201d\nAmongst the wheels, wheels, and record deals\nThe dead earth squeals\n\u2018Cause it can\u2019t get her seals\u2014the leopard steals\nSkin to live.  Whirlwind life\nSpin and give.  Pollute world, kill the kids\nSkin the pigs.  Dolla dolla bill\nThis is it.  Pop another bottle if you feel this shit\n\n[Hook One: Malcolm Bix] (x3)\nMy mother kill seal\n\n[Hook Two: 4th Pyramid]\nSeal killer.  Feel iller\nReal thriller.  Kill killer\nSeal killer.  Real thriller\nFeel iller.  Kill killer\n\n[Outro: C-Rayz Walz and 4th Pyramid]\n[C-Rayz Walz]\nAtomic.  So radioactive\nWhen you touch me, you vomit\nAtomic.  So radioactive\nWhen you touch me, you vomit\n[4th Pyramid]\nHigher and dumb today\nRobbing for funds\u2014I\u2019m crazed (Crazed, crazed)"}]}
