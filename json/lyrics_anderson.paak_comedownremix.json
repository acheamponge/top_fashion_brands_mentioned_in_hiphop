Well that's exactly what a nigga came for\nHuh, you talking shots from afar\nI'ma meet you at your front door\nUh, so hard to be doing what you really meant for, beauty\nHuh, but don't I make it look easy\nDon't I make it look good\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nYou drank up all my liquor, come on\nWhat I'm supposed to do now?\nAnd you talking all that shit, now come on\nYou gonna have to back it up\nIf I get too high now, sugar, come on\nI might never come down\nYou know I might never come down\nLet me get down\nYou might not never come down\nNow let me come down\nYou might not never come down\nLet me get down!\n\n[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]\nYou might never ever come down\nIt took too long to get this high off the ground\nDon't run, just stay awhile\n\n[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]\nCan't beat it, can't beat it\nCan't beat it, can't beat it with the big bad door\nCan't see her with this pitch black Gucci frames on\nLet me take these bitches off\nLet me get the full scope, hold up\nHuh, full screen, HD, let me take another picture\nLet me pull it to the pre-show\nWhoa, cool beans, cool beans\nThat's a whole lot of reefer\nLet me help you with the pre-roll\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nYou, drank up all my liquor, come on\nWhat I'm supposed to do now?\nAnd you talking all that shit, now come on\nYou gonna have to back it up\nIf I get too high now, sugar, come on\nI might never come down\nYou know I might never come down\nLet me get down\nYou might not never come down\nNow let me come down\nYou might not never come down\nLet me get down!\n\n[Bridge: Anderson.

No, tell 'em \"hell no\"\nMiddle finger, duck, roll and tell pros\nStick it to the rear like it's velcro\nWhat other country can you sell blow?\nAnd for less than a kilo, man, you get an elbow\nI'm gettin' high, never come down\nRound up your rile and we'll run it down\nSoon as it dries I'ma run the town\nI fantasize shooting Trump down\nA shot for every black man who got gunned down\nBy the police with no convictions, still they run 'round\nWhen we protest they tell us pipe down\nFor Trayvon and Mike Brown\nCNN wanna make it black/white\nCause we hit the action with a blacklight\nMake them suckers act right, yeah!\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nYou, drank up all my liquor, come on\nWhat I'm supposed to do now?\nAnd you talking all that shit, now come on\nYou gonna have to back it up\nIf I get too high now, sugar, come on\nI might never come down\nYou know I might never come down\nLet me get down\nYou might not never come down\nNow let me come down\nYou might not never come down\nLet me get down!\n\n[Bridge: Anderson. Paak]\nYou might never ever come down\nIt took too long to get this high off the ground\nDon't run, just stay awhile\nYou might never ever come down\nIt took too long to get this high off the ground\nDon't run, just stay awhile"}]}
