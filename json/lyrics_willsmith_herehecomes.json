Dude's resilient\nFresh Prince was hot, the movies killed him\nWait, hold up, STOP! You can rebuild him\nLock him back in hip-hop while dude's not filmin\nShocked by the film and the TV money\nWent from scenes with Uncle Phil to scenes that's sunny\nIt's so hard to break free from a guaranteed 20\nBut it's done, so come see the MC honey!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Will Smith]\nEvery time he touch the mic\nHe close his eyes and he hope to shine\nAnd like a streak of light\nIntro his name, they be like ahhhh!\n\n[Hook]\n\nHere come Big Will again\nHere come Big Will again!!!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b6862accc0e70d12f7d4a50c2aee85da.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Lost and Found", "title": "Here He Comes"}]}
