motherfuckers\nYet you have entered the psycho ward\nWhere the X-Raided lays his head, niggas\nSo let that nigga tell his story... beotch\n[X-Raided]\nI be stalkin' like jason, nigga I ain't sayin' shit\nMask on wit' a machedi in my right mit\nAin't gon' be no \"cha cha cha... cha cha cha\"\n'Cause all you gon' be hearin' is \"ratta-tat\" and \"pop pop\"\nAnd it ain't gotta be no friday the thirteenth\nI don't give a fuck if it's sunday the fifteenth\nAny day is good for me to go and kill a ho\nSo fuck the money, mo murder mo murder mo\nAnd it's a nightmare on yo' mama's street\nBut freddy's bitch-ass is dead, so now you got to deal wit' me\nAnd ain't no need to make no part two, three or fo'\n'Cause I'm gon' kill 'em all in that first episode\nSlit 'em open with the straight razor\nKillin' 'em quicker than that mother fucker pinhead on hellraiser\nI'm hellbound so the X-Raided loc ain't no joke\nWhen I creep I use that nine-millimeter to split yo' face wide open\n'Cause nigga you know I got no brain\nMama said when I was young I didn't play I liked to gangbang\nMy psychiatrist told me I was totally insane\nI'm packin' a millimeter nine-a nina it's same daisy\nI got that loco-active siccness\nMakin' a nigga lunatic\nI fit you filthy murderous when I'm blastin' on them bitches\nKillin' 'em up, fillin' 'em up with lead\nI'm full of that liquor I'm stickin' my trigga unloadin' da shit sicc\nSo psychoactive nigga bangin' the deuce-fo' s t r to the double e t\nDon't tell my nina you seem to be incubate\nAnd I ain't trippin' on all that payback shit you ripped in jail\nBy then I'll have that nine to make that brain thang hang out, nigga\nYou fuckin' with the g'sta\nWhen you runnin' up on the x you better bring your favorite preacher\nWitchya\n'Cause you gon' need him to be a witness when I smoke ya\nLook you in yo' eyes and say \"you shoulda been a loc'sta\"\n[Killa Hoe (Da Misses)]\nCreepin' through the dark with that motherfuckin' mask on\nPackin' that nine-millimeter niggas be ready to get they blast on\nCreepin' through the dark...\n(... murderin' motherfuckers)\nAimin' for the heart...\n(... slaughterin' motherfuckers)\n[X2]\n[Da Misses]\nPick up yo' god damn remote turn on your TV\nYa hit the channel to one eighty-seven faculty\nLook in the light you'll see that sista, \"hey LSG\"\nOh with the stogie-ogie-ogie now follow

nine-millimeter niggas be ready to get they blast on\n[Chopah]\nBiatch get your grip 'cause I'm on that mission\nI slit first like O.J. so don't let me start rippin'\nShift up like a wind storm, now hollow ones make your body warm\nBut niggas are wanted for the life I have no pitty 'cause I love harm\nSo I... want to bust caps like a g\nHey g pass me the hk afta that nine-millie so them fools come remember me\n\"you crazy nigga,\" not crazy, I'm psycho\nOnce I'm bustin' shots at them niggas moonwalk just like michael\nI flip, 'how you flip?'\nI'm flippin' it back and forth\nI'm havin' one of them bitches movin' they mouth and playin' poor sport\nOh shit mista nigga where's yo vest I'm 'bouts to pop ya\nHow many times do I have to tell you you cannot like fuck with the chopsta\nI rip shit the fuck up, that's the perfect sign to\nSlit your throat, and bury your ass where no one can find you\nWith my mask on, my paths leave no evidence\nBlack gloves black scarf crept I creep nights so handle shits\nYou punk-ass bustas\nI heard you couldn't trust us\nYour set be should be on move sorry 'cause your whole block is bustas\nVamp like that, black is cool I see no sunshine\nKnocka full

left on the concrete\nThere he lay when the AK spray brains lookin like hamburger meat\nI'm gettin' ghost like casper\nBut I'm not that friendly nigga I'm that Lunasicc bastard\nI'm hazardous to my own health\nJust any minute I just might grab that nine millimeter and bust my own self\nSo we can take it to the next level\nI go to hell and get at the grim reeper yellin' \"fuck the devil!\"\nSo we can take it to the crossroads, motherfucker\nEven then my nine steadily loaded killin' all you bustas\nFill it up with hollow tips then pop nigga drop me one\nFillin' all you devils up with them hot ones\nKickin' down doors with x, shoot my gat in fuck the discussion\nAll I want is the cash, if there ain't none I'ma blast\nKillin' ya doctor, ya ambulance driva, and ya nurse\nYou're walkin' to your funeral 'cause x'loc blew up your hurse\nYou'z a victim of the lunasicc, hell of quick to blast\nAsh to ash dust to dust right up on yo' motherfuckin' ass\nWith the quicka, the reepa the nigga\nTakin' the gat with a blast straight to the dome\nLunasicc for the nine-five bitch creepin' with my mask on\n[Killa hoe (da misses)]\nCreepin' through the dark with that motherfuckin' mask
