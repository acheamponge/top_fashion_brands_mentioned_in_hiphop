Upfront, let's go!\nKonvict, Konvict, ha ha\nWe in too deep to turn back now, D (sure is)\nWatch yourself, 'fore you get blown away\n\n[Verse 1: Styles P]\nYou know where I come from\nThe place where your fade is a mic or a bull or dum-dum\nA jail cell, a pine box, and brothers are dumb young\nStill bust a gun for the slum that they come from\nCops is the only ones they gon' run from\nThey puttin' they hood up\nBut 9 out of 10 of us ain't got good luck\nYou gon' ride on a man and catch 25\nOr get hit and get sent to the other side\nYou lose both sides of the coin\nSo me, I play the hood, baby, 9 in the groin\nMomma got a little church I could join, but I ain't go yet\nMan got a mosque I could join, but I ain't go yet\nCool with the devil on my back, I'm in cold sweats\nAbout to do some dirt in some dirty black old sweats\nIf you known you should've shown the way\nMost the hood on the path to get blown away\n\n[Hook: Akon]\n\u2018Cause I was raised up to show no fear\nCowardly hearts'll never last long here\nIf you ain't man up to make shit clear\nGuaranteed you'll get blown away\n\u2018Cause I done seen the block break down tears\nAnd I done seen the cops break my peers\nTryna hold on a couple mo' years\nTryin' not to get blown away\n\n[Verse 2: Akon]\nSee, I ain't never shot nobody\nBut I'm known for fighting\nSo when I strike, man, you think you been struck by lightning\nShouldn't have to prove myself by killin' a nigga\nEven a child can take a life by pullin' a trigger\nRetaliation only takes anger mixed with passion\nSee your target in the distance and keep on blastin'\nThey say, \"Guns don't kill people, people do\"\nSo when you hit, man, you feel that shit them evils do\nCan't see myself gettin' beat down, my eyes swollen\nMoms crying, really don't know what happened\nMy pride's stolen\nIf I ain't got my heat, then I got a blade\nThat can get you off me in so many ways\n\n[Hook]\n\u2018Cause I was raised up to show no fear\nCowardly hearts'll never last long here\nIf you ain't man up to make shit clear\nGuaranteed you'll get blown away\n\u2018Cause I done seen the block break down tears\nAnd I done seen the cops break my peers\nTryna hold on a couple mo' years\nTryin' not to get blown away\n\n[Verse 3: Akon]\nI keep my eye out for Jakes, ears to the streets\nOther eye out for snakes and these scandalous freaks\nIf we ain't on good terms, don't bother to speak\nDon't smile and try to spark a convo with me\nSame thing make you laugh will make you cry\nFuck around and let this quiet nigga here take your life\nHate for it to be you the world's sacrifice\nSo somebody else could travel through the tunnel of life\n\u2018Cause I'm that type of guy\nI'll be there when you're ridin', but I stay to myself\nSo if you see me out there with a bear and we fightin'\nNigga, then go help the bear\n\n[Hook]\n\u2018Cause I was raised up to show no fear\nCowardly hearts'll never last long here\nIf you ain't man up to make shit clear\nGuaranteed you'll get blown away\n\u2018Cause I done seen the block break down tears\nAnd I done seen the cops break my peers\nTryna hold on a couple mo' years\nTryin' not to get blown away", "title": "Blown Away", "album": "Konvicted"}], "artist": "Akon"}
