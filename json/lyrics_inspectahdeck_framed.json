Rap]\nThey got me framed, locked and chained\nCuz some lame on the block was slain\nCops came but I ain't pop a flame\nHear me ya honor? I ain't dropped a thing\nI was cuffed, they told me that somebody dropped my name\nAnd the time they tryin' to match me with is not the same\nI was knocked from 8:00 to the time the shot went rang\nWhen I woke up, I smoked up and watched the game\nThen I laid up with my bitch and got rocked with brain\nRelease me from this Elymer Fudd shit, the glove don't fit\nToo tall for the cop description and slugs don't fit\nHe was hit with a nine right? I bust slugs with a fifth\nYou got any of my D.N.A. or blood up in this bitch?\nI'm not the guy aligned to fall, this not my crime at all\nYou lock me up, I'm climbin' the wall\nYou want me scapegoat, so stay close, alliance will call\nWith some grimy niggas schemin' on the shines in the hall\nFuck that, you and the D.A. spit-shine our balls\nYou can catch up with me some other time, from mines to yours\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Killa Sin]\nCome on a plea bargain for what, your honor?\nNah yo I ain't do shit, the only thing I'm coppin' is a new whip\nThe night it happened I was lampin' at a deuce flick with two chicks\nKim and Chris, we guzzle Cris' on some Rush Hour 2 shit\nI knew the kid, yeah we had problems, yeah I robbed him\nNow it's '98 though and the handgun was a revolver\nYou tryin' to play me on an old case but I hold no weight\nTurned myself in, I skated on them keystone jakes\nRight description, right Killa, wrong case, I didn't hit him\nHere's the verdict, not guilty, not tryin' to see a prison\nGot my life on the line, you wanna grind me through ya system\nAnd have my family and my wiz cryin', I miss 'em\nYou buggin', you the same judge that framed K with the drugs\nSomebody came up dead and now you wanna blame us?\nThis shit is too much, aiyo before you screw us\nI'll grab the bailiff's gun and light this whole room up {*gunshot*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c3d252f814a4716a7a99fe1984ad2678.948x936x1.jpg", "album": "The Movement", "year": null}]}
