(I love my mom, I love my mom)\nDo you hate my boyfriend? (but I love my mom)\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'll be\nRight outside your front door on my 12 speed\nI got your emotions tattooed on my sleeve\nI think about you all the time, I've waited for you all my life\nI need you right here by my side\nI'll be (I'll be)\nRight outside your front door on my 12 speed (my 12 speed)\nI got your emotions tattooed on my sleeve (my sleeve)\nI think about you all the time, I've waited for you all my life\nI need you right here by my side\n\n[Outro]\nEmpty home\nEmpty, empty, empty home\nI wanna be American\nMy family\u2019s gone, but I don\u2019t care because I love\nThem"}], "artist": "Kevin Abstract"}
