shark\nIn the sea\nJust a minnow\nI said get lost\nWhen I make that move back\nWhen God closed the door\nThen he opened the window\nAsked me to cap\nIn the end of the map\nAnd he wanted to rob\nBut he captured me\nActually me and my fat booty\nRunning this\nSo I could give a fuck\nWho\u2019s coming after me\n\nNiggas say they got shit\nCrackin\nY\u2019ll niggas ain\u2019t did shit\nY\u2019ll niggas

players\nBitch niggas and haters\nBreaking the code\nMy niggas be loading\nBonding for four\nNights of paper\nSmoking some dope\nWith Mariah\nMy niggas be\nKeeping their fire\nMy Glock is hot\nYour bitches is shot\nI lift it off of the wire\n\nMy dick long Oscar Meyer\nBig chick we get tired\nStaying fresh on the miss it\nAnd I did it through the dryer\nMy niggas be trapping\nYour niggas be acting\nMe never slacking\nI get it and then\nI stamp it\nDouble  it up\nIn a Pamper\nLockies living like gassers\nGet it to the hamper\nMoving at work\nFresh to the dirt\nWhat did I do to the

the trap to the track\n\nI get kick backs from my hoe bitch\nShe bring me raps in the stack\nShe say on that see if you can hold this\nI\u2019m a young nigga but an old Crip\nAnd I keep a semi auto rolled fifth\nAnd I\u2019m cool and calm\nUntil a nigga get out of line\nBet Ima sure trip\n\nBut later for that\nI\u2019m about my brand\nWhen it comes to bitches\nI\u2019m about the head\nWhen the lap turanis?\nLittle rap  niggas\nOn the track niga\nI\u2019ll be killing them dead\nYeah\n\nIf it was a war I would fill them with lead\nHave his missing face on a milk carton\nAssassinate him with the same rifle\nFrom the same roof that they killed Martin\nEating like a Hulk but I\u2019m still starving\nIt\u2019s like an ex like a marm\nInstead a pill garden\nSaying you legit honey you the
