But what is love without the pain to go along?\nAnd what is pain, if not the reason for me to sing this song?\nAnd this song is for the weak and for the strong\n'Cause I was strong and still\nShe got me, she got me, bang, bang, she got me\nShe got me, she got me, bang, bang\nShe was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun\nReady to fire me a hot one, it went bang, bang, bang\nStraight through my heart\nAlthough I could have walked away\nI stood my ground and let her spray\nShe shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me\nShe shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me\nShe shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me\nShe shot me, she shot me, bang, bang"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
