Let me get a Jack Daniels with a bud light on the side\nOoh boy, what day!\nYou have a rough one old pal?\nHell, everyday is out here working my ass for a dollar and bringing home a damn nickel\nAt least you can bring home a nickel, I ain't bring home nothing\nHell I don't mind the work, that old factory's been good to me and the family\nMy bills is paid and food in the fridge\nI guess I'm just looking for something more out of life, that's all\nBut I got big plans for the future, let me tell ya\nNo kidding? That's cool man\nThat's right, but enough talk about my future\nI came to do two things tonight, get loose... and get drunk\nThat's two of my favorite things buddy, I'll drink to that\nTo the working man!"}], "artist": "SMO"}
