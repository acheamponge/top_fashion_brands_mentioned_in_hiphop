Hey! Hey!\n\nAiiiiiieeeee!\n\n[Hook]\nDon't get this wrong\nThis revolution song\nHoping the wind can blow your way for once\nA man is truly dead when confident\nThat's why we're all still waiting here so long\n\nCommandante, come back home\nCommandante, come back home\nCommandante, come back home\nThat's why we're all still waiting here so long"}], "artist": "\u200bk-os"}
