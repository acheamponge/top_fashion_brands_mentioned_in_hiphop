Power!\nBut the abuser put his fist in all the little boys dreams\nTill he sifted and mixed his shit in\nTo be what he hated wasn\u2019t the aim\nBut his hatred really made him exactly what he became\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nOk bitch was just a weapon I\u2019m using it to suggest that\nThe primary example is usually the parents, see\nMama didn\u2019t stand up \u2019cause mama couldn\u2019t lift her chin up\nWith all the shame she carried she figured they won\u2019t forgive her, see\nMama didn\u2019t notice that the baby wasn\u2019t old enough\nShe coulda really shown em that there\u2019s nowhere left to go but up\nAll mama had to do is look and listen but\nMama as afraid as both of her little children\nSo she let \u2018em hear it, let \u2018em see it\nLet \u2018em grow up, let \u2018em be it\nWhen all she had to do was just show up and help \u2018em beat it\nNow as they grew up in the world\nThe little boy\u2019s lost and has him a little girl\nAnd his life changes -- again\nHe don\u2019t ever wanna see her hurt by men\nTo protect her through everything on earth he can\nAnd that moment he understands\nWoman should never be hurt by words or hands\nAnd just like that that little boy becomes a man\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nBitch bad, woman good\nLady better, they misunder -\nI can't do that part, fuck it\nI gotta hear that fat nigga do it\nBitch bad, woman good\nLady better, they misunderstood\nNope\nI'm killing these bitches\nYeah fuck the singing part", "year": "2012-11-01"}]}
