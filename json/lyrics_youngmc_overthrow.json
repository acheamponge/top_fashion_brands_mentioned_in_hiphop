{"songs": [{"title": "Overthrow", "lyrics": "[Spoken Intro]\nFriends, homies, and countrymen\nLend me your ears\nLet me holla at you for a minute\nWe found ourselves at a unique moment in time\nA time to seize upon a golden opportunity\nA time for the overthrow\nA time to give a voice to those who have lost their voice\nTo speak for those who have no status in the current status quo\nA time for us to make history by simply changing history\nIt starts here, it starts now\nIt's the overthrow\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow I'm pleased to profess, from the east to the west\nThat there's something going on that I need to address\nSome feelings in my heart that I need to express\nAnd some possible solutions I need to suggest\nThe world I see is a world of excess\nThat's enjoyed by a few and in spite of the rest\nThe words that they speak and the way that they dress\nAnd the rest fall back because we say we're impressed\nI see a lot of good people go through stress\nBecause they won't sell their soul for the gold of success\nI know I'm not alone in pointing out this mess\nBut to get a coalition, you gotta coalesce\nSuppose this one goes out to those who oppress\nDon't care about your clothes or the roads you possess\nTo make progress, I gotta let you know\nYou must bear witness to the overthrow\n\n[Hook]\nIt's the overthrow\nI'm sick and tired of waiting on some overflow\nCause that's over, bro\nAnd it's not over property or over dough\nThrow the hourglass up, time's over yo\nIt's the overthrow\nI'm sick and tired of waiting on some overflow\nCause that's over, bro\nAnd it's not over property or over dough\nThrow the hourglass up, time's over yo\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhile at home in your palace on your throne with your chalice\nI'mma creep up from behind with no meaning of malice\nDon't need to be rude, and no need to be callous\nAvoid the shot [?] from [?] to Dallas\nYou're making so much money that you pack it away\nA lot more than was available back in the day\nI'm reacting the same, look at this whole thing now\nYou keep this up, you gon' bring this whole thing down\nI won't stand still just to watch this fail\nCause the actions of some of them beyond repair\nSo well this train just went off the rails\nBut if we stand up now, then we must prevail\nCause there's so many souls who could tell the tale\nLet me give you a tip: we gonna tip the scales\nI'mma blaze the trail so we all can grow\nBut you must bear witness to the overthrow\n\n[Hook]\nIt's the overthrow\nI'm sick and tired of waiting on some overflow\nCause that's over, bro\nAnd it's not over property or over dough\nThrow the hourglass up, time's over yo\nIt's the overthrow\nI'm sick and tired of waiting on some overflow\nCause that's over, bro\nAnd it's not over property or over dough\nThrow the hourglass up, time's over yo\n\n[Verse 3]\nLullaby and goodnight, but the rhymes that I write\nThat you can't get away from, try as you might\nYou had your chance, but you were high as a kite\nSo because of your sin, now you're in for a fight\nThe rap industries wanna speak up tonight\nFor those in the know where they're feeling my plight\nThey smile in your face, but it just isn't right\nCause they promise you Paris, but they give you parasites\nMy metaphors are nice when I turn a phrase\nAnd they can be interpreted in different ways\nSo if somebody out there has got you crazed\nUse this song for what you want, man, I won't be phased\nLook, there's so many folks feel oppressed these days\nBut if you got nerve, you deserve some praise\nThey'll be amazed when you let them know\nThat they must bear witness to the overthrow\n\n[Hook]\nIt's the overthrow\nI'm sick and tired of waiting on some overflow\nCause that's over, bro\nAnd it's not over property or over dough\nThrow the hourglass up, time's over yo\nIt's the overthrow\nI'm sick and tired of waiting on some overflow\nCause that's over, bro\nAnd it's not over property or over dough\nThrow the hourglass up, time's over yo\nIt's the overthrow\nI'm sick and tired of waiting on some overflow\nCause that's over, bro\nAnd it's not over property or over dough\nThrow the hourglass up, time's over yo\nIt's the overthrow\nI'm sick and tired of waiting on some overflow\nCause that's over, bro\nAnd it's not over property or over dough\nThrow the hourglass up, time's over yo\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nNow, let me make this clear\nJust because I'm a veteran in this game\nDoesn't mean I feel anyone owes me anything\nI'm not looking for some kind of handout\nBut you don't need to engage in affirmative action\nIn order to engage in action which is affirmative\nKnow what I'm saying?\nI'm not looking for the proverbial forty acres and a mule\nI just want equal access to the real estate agent and the car dealership\nAnd once I get through that door\nI will handle my business, please believe\nBut until that day, you must bear witness to the overthrow", "album": "Relentless", "year": "2008-08-01", "image":
