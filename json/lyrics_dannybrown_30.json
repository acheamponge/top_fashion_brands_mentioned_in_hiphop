You the greatest rapper ever\nSo now the pressure's on, to prove that voice right\nSome people never know they goals, knew mine my whole life\nSo now his turn's up, fixing up to bat\nPitching singles to the label when I used to pitch crack\nI never learned to rap, always knew how\nEver since a nigga 8, knew what I would do now\nWhen I turned 28, they like, \"What you gon' do now?\"\nAnd now a nigga 30, so I don't think they heard me\nThat the last ten years, I been so fucking stressed\nTears in my eyes, let me get this off my chest\nThe thoughts of no success got a nigga chasing death\nDoing all these drugs, hope for OD'ing next, Triple X", "year": "2011-08-15"}], "artist": "Danny Brown"}
