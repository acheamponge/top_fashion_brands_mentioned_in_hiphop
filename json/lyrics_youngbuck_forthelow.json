{"songs": [{"title": "For The Low", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou ever woke up with a penny went to sleep with a million?\nTold your partner you'd kill him if he didn't split what's in the ceilin'\nJust if you know the feelin' when all your niggas is winnin'\nYou don't know who pretendin' when everybody is grinnin'\nMy preacher ask me what I been doin' I told him just sinnin'\nTell my girl I been faithful but I'm fuckin' off with these women\nReally I'm runnin' out of patience with the way that I'm livin'\nPounds need to be bagged, birds need to be driven\nI'm takin' anything I want and I ain't askin' permission\nChargin' 30 makin' 8, payin' 22 per chicken\nThere is no competition so I'm makin' my decision\nAnd you gotta come and get 'em, ain't no wings on the pigeons\n\n\n[Hook]\nCome and see me I got everything\nI'm talkin' weed, coke and heroine\nAnd I always got it for the low\nI always got it for the low\nYou should see the way I'm lookin man\nThe way I whip it, way I cook it man\nAnd I always got it for the low\nI always got it for the low\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey just rolled up on my partner put a hole in his pocket\nOn my momma front porch I was forced to watch it\nSeen all sorts of different pills that my daddy was poppin'\nHe forget where he live until he wake up and vomit\nPretty soon I had to make my pops a part of my profit\nRather see me get it than some other niggas that got it\nNow all my cars is foreign, all my bitches exotic\nI don't care what you do, just don't play with my product\nI got a couple down bitches kept it real, they solid\nKeep pounds in they apartment and put 'em through college\nMy grandma got a garden and I ain't talkin' vegetables\nI got my hand on my testicles, nigga\n\n\n[Hook x2]", "album": null, "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/787eb0fed4a05aa802dee3238c64431a.792x792x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young Buck"}
