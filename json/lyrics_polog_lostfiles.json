Of course\nLil Polo like that man on the horse\nI need a Lambo' or a Porsche\nTryna run up them M's\nGot place to flex on these niggas like I'm liftin' weights at the gym\nI hang with some killers\nFew lil' savages with me, my shooters don't aim at the rim\nHe tough with his chest out, we pull them TEC's out\nBlast 'til we knock off a limb\nHave him runnin' up out of his Timbs\nNiggas know we be wettin' shit\nIf you walk with the opps then I hope you can swim", "year": "2019-06-07"}]}
