(somethin sweet) lover.. somethin sweet\n\n[Verse 2: Tha Trademarc]\nWe run game, fill the blanks in with your hon's name\nI can take an Eva hot bitch like bum change\nPlayin hard to get when I step, I'm afraid\nI can treat a chick like cheap gas and upgrade\nWhatever you need, whatever you want\nWith Trademarc on your arm, girl what more could you flaunt\nThere's just something about us, summer fling got you wondering\nWhere I'll be in spring, but that's another thing\nI'll be out girl, quicker than tans\nIf you want somethin stick hurr, stick wit'cha man\nI ain't lookin for a lover girl, I'm lookin for sex\nI can tell you I got money or I'm pushin a Lex\nWhatever gets you hot, that's what I say next\nGettin passed through the crew girl that's a safe bet\nI think it's funny how it doesn't take a whole lot\nTrademarc's like an open flame, getting girls hot\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: John Cena]\nYo... with these sweet flows, the streets knows\nWhether we pimped out in streets clothes, we the bomb like deep throws\nMy speech grows to reach hoes - all over the globe\nI got class like a Ric Flair robe\n\n[Verse 4: Tha Trademarc]\nMan I'm in and out quick like Jordan in the zone\nD takin out a bitch like a pass from Shaq to Kobe\nYou know me with a extra set of hands\nA bitch couldn't hold me man I leave 'em lonely\n\n[Verse 5: John Cena]\nIf I catch a glimpse of your chick when she smile and fine\nI make sure she lose your number, she'd be dialin mine\nI ain't about a wife even if she won this right\nI'll fuck for seven days but stand for one night\n\n[Verse 6: Tha Trademarc]\nMan we decked out John, the strict gutter\nI'll have a girl repeatin my name in sex like the bitch stutter\nI got moves lookin butter with a tight fade\nForever dipped fresh man like Minot Gray\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "John Cena & Tha Trademarc"}
