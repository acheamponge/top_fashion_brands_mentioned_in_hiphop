{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nCatch me on Venice Beach working on my base, no blonde streak\nSwimming trunk, 30K in arm's reach\nI'm on the boat, in the water like a swan's feet\nTo show respect you kiss both sides of the Don's cheek\n360 on the Seadoo in a tux\nCall my homie, tell him meet me down in Lido Beach for lunch\nPl\u00e1cido Polanco crib, his bitch was black\nShe started purring, I kissed the cat\nAristocrat, wrist dancing like a disco bass\nIn the holster, same shit color as Sisqo's hair\n635 slammed like a suplex\nCheat off a Chinese kid just like a school test\nI'm on the hunt for loot, jump out the chunky coupe\nHold on, wait till it thunder, here's the gun to shoot\nBeige leather to the calf, where my math at?\nYou gonna babysit my joint? Then pussy pass that\n\n[Hook]\nI'm getting paper regardless, I'm never facing no charges\nI got your honor under the armpit\nThe gavel slam and I walk\nHammer dances on the porch, downtown gallivanting with a horse\nTwo different drugs to choose, I need the third thing\nOriental style shirt\nFlapping in the wind like a bird's wing\nI need that good green, ugh, motherfucker need that good green\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got the face like a grown lion, my people hold iron\nPredict the weather by the wind like an old Mayan\nHold my son up, show him to the kingdom\nWhile all his blood brothers became drug runners in England\nMade in Queens, Handball courts and 40s\nShorties smoking blunts, spades in the corner\nWe moving white like David Spade in the sauna\nAll the money chronological, it look like callaloo\nProvide the crew designer suits, exotic food\nErotic nude and polished shoes, impala smooth\nRoll up, looking like Sinbad with the earring\nLightskin sucking my penis while I'm steering\nI'm pro\n\n[Hook]", "title": "The Don\u2019s Cheek", "album": "Blue Chips 2", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3tkvpk6nyazea6ub0nsnj8s01.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2013-11-01"}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
