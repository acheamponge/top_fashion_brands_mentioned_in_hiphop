"lyrics": "[Intro: Cuzzy Capone]\nI'm from Slauson, when shit get drastic down here\nFuck a room, go to sleep in a casket\nI\u2019m from Slauson, when shit get drastic down here\nFuck a room, go to sleep in a casket\nI'm from Slauson, when shit get drastic down here\nFuck a room, go to sleep in a casket\nI'm from Slauson, when shit get drastic down here\nFuck a room, go to sleep in a casket\n\n[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]\nMy nigga why you come \u2019round here?\nKnowing you ain't from 'round here?\nThat's how you get robbed and shot\nLil niggas they got guns 'round here\n'Cause niggas die young 'round here\nSo you better get off the block\nMy nigga why you come 'round here?\nKnowing you ain\u2019t from \u2019round here?\nThat's how you get robbed and shot\nAnd lil niggas they got guns \u2019round here\n'Cause niggas die young 'round here\nSo you better get off the\u2013\nLet's take the block through my hood\n\n[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]\nCrenshaw corner stores, dope spots on the low\nYoung homies hit the pen, old G\u2019s on parole (Let's go)\nDice games in the back, air holes in the MAC\nLeather on my seats, burners stashed in my Cadillac\nYellow tape, white chalk, 10th Ave, High Park\nYoung black males catchin' hell from them white cops\nG-Rod on one, two homies, three guns\nHoppin' out, killin' shit, four-five semi-spit\nFour-five niggas hit, my retaliation, go\nSomebody got two dollars, just a part of gang bangin', yo\nAnd Bush keep talkin' 'bout the war in the Middle East\nBut he don't give a fuck about this war in these city streets\nSo fuck peace, I'ma ride on my enemies\nAnd friends is somethin' we can never pretend to be\nI'm showin' you somethin' that you was never meant to see\nYou might choose your life, there's killers in the vicinity\n\n[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]\nMy nigga why you come 'round here?\nKnowing you ain't from 'round here?\nThat's how you get robbed and shot\nLil niggas they got guns 'round here\n'Cause niggas die young 'round here\nSo you better get off the block\nMy nigga why you come 'round here?\nKnowing you ain't from 'round here?\nThat's how you get robbed and shot\nAnd lil niggas they got guns 'round here\n'Cause niggas die young 'round here\nSo you better get off the\u2013\nLet's take the block through my hood\n\n[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]\nRidin' [?] 63rd, flip work off the curb\nGot crashed, cops that hop gates wanna hear the bird\nYoung flips give me head, tryna keep me in the bed\nOnce I get my nut, I'm out the door, I'm all about my bread\nWestside killers ride, never seen a nigga die\nNow he trigger-traumatized, humble from the homicide\nGang bang nigga shit, same day different shit\nMore drama than a soap opera where I'm livin' bitch\nAnd everybody talkin' bout stop snitchin'\nI was countin' from your street lights, so they don't need a witness\nThey come to court wit' a tape on your ass\nWith your face on blast, close cased on your ass\nI let off ten shots, I got plenty to go (Alright)\nDo a nigga like O-Dog, hit that bitch in the store, for real\n'Cause when Caine was on the set filmin' Menace\nWe was servin' on the steps, no respect for the tenants\n\n[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]\nMy nigga why you come 'round here?\nKnowing you ain't from 'round here?\nThat's how you get robbed and shot\nLil niggas they got guns 'round here\n'Cause niggas die young 'round here\nSo you better get off the block\nMy nigga why you come 'round here?\nKnowing you ain't from 'round here?\nThat's how you get robbed and shot\nAnd lil niggas they got guns 'round here\n'Cause niggas die young 'round here\nSo you better get off the\u2013\nLet's take the block through my hood\n\n[Verse 3: Cuzzy Capone]\nI'm rep of 5-8, I'm Crenshaw ace-ace\nI'm blue steal 38's, I send 'em to the pearly gates\nI'm young thug, get it straight\nWhite teeth, Bathing Ape\nI smoke big kush wit' S-Black and Big Wake\n[?] thousand dollar jeans, mind on another page\nCome and get money nigga, grind rocks from the cage\nViolence in one time, hustle on another stage\nPop shops, crash cops, niggas livin' in a rage\nUnder street lights, in my district, get waved at 'em\n[?], [?], I'm dope-locked, 8th Ave\nI post up, set shop, go hard, and get cash\nLean on the gate wit' a K and a face mask\nSo if you think you touchin' us, not hardly\nWhen the rifle blast it sound like the pipes on a Harley\nIf you think I'm new around here, I beg your pardon\nI'm Slauson Avenue, I'm little Marcus Garvey\n\n[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]\nMy nigga why you come 'round here?\nKnowing you ain't from 'round here?\nThat's how you get robbed and shot\nLil niggas they got guns 'round here\n'Cause niggas die young 'round here\nSo you better get off the block\nMy nigga why you come 'round here?\nKnowing you ain't from 'round here?\nThat's how you get robbed and shot\nAnd lil niggas they got guns 'round here\n'Cause niggas die young 'round here\nSo you better get off the\u2013\nLet's take the block through my hood"}], "artist": "Nipsey Hussle"}
