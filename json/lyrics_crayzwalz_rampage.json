Trying to recreate history.  Yeah (Yeah).  Record more (Record more).  Yeah.  C-Rayz in the house.  Stronghold!  The Ancients in full effect, recreate history on some next.  Snap your necks.  Taking large checks.  Yeah.  B Slim recording.  And we \u2018bout to do this.  We \u2018bout to do it.  Yo\n\n[Verse 1: Paze]\nYeah, we get rugged, tough, hard like P\nTry to diss mines, got scarred by me\nChi chi man [?]\nThe Ancients are wars drawn to form Battletron\nThink the SPN aerosol with the digital read\nI\u2019ll spit the heat out on the most critical beat out\nY\u2019all get your styles off MP3\nEvery backpacker named Timmy wants an MPC\nY\u2019all ass like an anal sex queen\u2019s best scenes\nI splash with the force of an extreme wet dream\nAs I smother your girl with mother of pearl\nI\u2019m sick with it\u2014I\u2019ll leave the track covered with Earl\n\u2018Cause I clot pesos, don\u2019t sell yayo\nAnother word for cocaine is perico\nThat\u2019s Spanish.  \u201cTake that\u201d means toma\nT\u00fa sabes mi estilo, MCs.  No me jodas\nWhen Paze dumbs, he makes the place jump\nThinking shit\u2019s sweet can get your face lumped\n[?] these girls is awaking, they stay right on my tit, Mazz\nAnd, at the same time, I\u2019m thinking, \u201cDamn\u201d\nHow could a brother spit so tight, it makes virgin chicks pro-dyke?\nI shine so bright.  Y\u2019all flick like strobe lights\nI take the cake, leave you with no slice\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m banging your wife on the table with chrome pipe\nPaze\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz with DJ Scratches] (x4)\nSlow down, baby\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nThe spitter, the splasher control the audience\nBeen to Motowns/mo\u2019 towns than Berry Gordy kids\nI get the inspiration from unnecessary stations\nThat keep playing imitation shit\nYou can\u2019t flow, kid.  You\u2019re weak and don\u2019t shine\nI speak the street \u2018til I outpeep your quotes\nMidget MCs with vagina meat slacks\nDon\u2019t inspire the life.  Cut your veins with a axe\nSpears the lands through a glance\nGet in a trance, \u201cShoot to Kill\u201d like a soundboy dance\nPure entertainment despite your arrangement\nI\u2019m filthy, blaze sound with The Ancients\nNo more jobs.  Mazz, Paze, Walz\nYou and your squad better sways or get robbed\nNo other nation\u2019s dumbing, mumble off acres\nWhen I get dumb, you hear it\u2014the spirit of paper\nSo take your life now.  Flow?  I dare you\nMy ride\u2019s fully stolen\u2014I ain\u2019t trying to scare you\nWith crips in scripts chicken and tripping\nRobbing and licking while you and your A&R kissing (Aw shit)\nSo just in case you wanna know if I rhyme, I don\u2019t\nOur sound\u2019ll make the crowd go, \u201cWoah\u201d\nMe getting dropped to stop won\u2019t be tolerated\nI rock off the top, forgetting I\u2019m [?]\nWalz\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz with DJ Scratches] (x4)\nSlow down, baby\n\n[Verse 3: Mazzi]\nWhen I come around, homeboy, watch your honey\nLeave her drained when I rain\u2014her smile sunny\nWhen I attack, [a prop is all laid to bone?]\nNow grab your shoes and go home\nHer pussy was packed from wall to wall and balls\nHit the tip of her clit and I can\u2019t stall\nEvery time since then that I\u2019m seeing her\nShe has flashbacks of me just creaming her\nAnd the notions of our sex motions\nGot a whore dumping the throat and short-choking\nKnees get weak and curl in your feet\nUsed to see techniques which surpass unique\nNo effort.  I step with the rawness to slay\nI\u2019m off it to blaze, get a taste of the glaze\nI\u2019m on a rampage\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz with DJ Scratches] (x8)\nSlow down, baby\n\n[Bridge: Paze with DJ Scratches] (x7)\nSlow down, baby\n\n[Outro: Paze]\nHeh, rampage.  Slow down, bitch-ass.  Slow down, bitch-ass.  Slow down, bitch-ass.  Slow down... (Aight, aight)"}]}
