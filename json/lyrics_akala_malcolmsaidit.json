It don't matter, they can't make change\nNew driver but we got no brakes\nWhatever the place, whatever the face\nThe master never ever frees his slave\nThey always knew it, so they pursue it\nBut we've been too divided to ever be guided through it\nGotta stop 'em because they're rotten from the days of picking cotton\nTo sell us a love song and we're so besotted\nSo confused, we believe their promise\nBut there are some that lead more honest\nThey are not forgotten, though they shot 'em\nSo scream to the top of your lungs right from the bottom!\n\nMalcolm said it, Martin said it\nMarley said it, Ali said it\nGarvey said it, Toussaint said it\nI weren't there but I'm sure Dessalines said it\nMalcolm said it, Martin said it\nMarley said it, Ali said it\nGarvey said it, Lumumba said it\nI weren't there but I'm sure Dessalines said it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Akala]\nPeople don't rebel, the rebels are the tyrants\nYou are not God, so we are not defiant\nNo human nature, just our behavior\nThe oppressed wanting their oppressor as their saviour\nAround the globe killin', made to be religion\nBut the book said they're sinnin' and that is just the beginnin'\nNow spread democracy by dropping a bomb\nOn a terrorist with no shoes or socks\nI reckon, history teaches us the lesson\nThe bigger terrorist is the one with the bigger weapons\nThey talked but we didn't listen\nThey spoke and then went missin'\nWe can't see all the things that imprison us\nCos we don't appreciate the freedoms that they have given us\nI wouldn't bet it, that we ever get it\nRun, tell your friends that Akala said it\n\n[Hook]\n\nMalcolm said it\nMartin said it\nMarley said it\nAli said it\nGarvey said it\nToussaint said it\nI weren't there but I'm sure Dessalines said it\nMalcolm said it\nMartin said it\nMarley said it\nAli said it\nGarvey said it\nLumumba said it\nI weren't there but I'm sure Dessalines said it", "year": null, "album": " The Thieves Banquet", "image": "https://images.genius.com/acaf5708a18660f33365d7d63e4937b7.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
