I'm super cold\nI keep these bitches hangin on my colthes. Let em know\nIt ain't a thang to swang in da club and get it crunk\nAnd you can meet me in da front like what, I pop da trunk\n\nBut I can't stay I gotta go\nBecause da police on the way a nigga know\nYou better roll outta they way n pull out slow\nLeave da spot with a bang of a .44\n\nNow you know I smoke that potent dro. My purple cold\nAnd you can get it from my ? Joe. That's by th Zone\nYo nose is open when I let it blow. Call up my chick\nAnd toss da bag and baby you roll you can roll\nHey you can smoke that's is you move out da way. And watch ya tone\nStay on da low and wear da k n coke ?\nToo bad my probations today. I gotta go gotta go\n\nI got more game than nintendo\n\nGot sticky icky in my dickie clothes. Hand on da stove\nAnd don't nobody tell me anymore. Just let me go\nIt ain't a thang when we hit da floor. My niggas know\nMe wild insane see my '64. Open da door\n\nW my vehicle call up my killas from da way\nAnd you can\n\nMy nigga call him\n\nAnd now u know I keep da sickest flow. Gun in my pocket\nYou can catch me at da liquor store. Right next to rocket\nWhere my money hustle hungry ah put down da buddy\nLet's go"}], "artist": "Bizzy Bone"}
