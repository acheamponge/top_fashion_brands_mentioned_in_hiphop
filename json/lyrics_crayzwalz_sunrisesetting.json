Pumping nickels\nIn beef, put four to five and pump the nickel\nPlayed the hate, glad I made it.  My datings triple\nY\u2019all might walk the talk, but my language cripples\nI\u2019m feeling myself\u2014don\u2019t open the door \u2018til I\u2019m finished\nTo the grates in your face, my script bump and blemish\nBroccoli clumps and spinach.  No beef!\nIced out like your freezer\u2019s missing\u2014no heat\nGo ahead and stick me\u2014I need a hit of that dope shit\nI\u2019m quiet.  When I riot, I\u2019m ferocious\nWatch for vultures, flying locusts, hocus pocus\n$2000 a cut like a pair of loafers.  The Sun Cycle!\n\n[Hook: Sample from Exuma's \"Mama Loi, Papa Loi\"] (x2)\nThe sun is shining in the night\nZombies walking in the broad daylight\nZombie, he done lost his soul\nZombie, he don't ever get old"}]}
