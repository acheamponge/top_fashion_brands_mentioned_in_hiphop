Keep the ratchet with me!\nKeep the ratchet with' me! I squeeze it 'til it's empty, sniiiitch!\nKeep the ratchet with' me! Keep the ratchet with me!\nKeep the ratchet with' me! I squeeze it 'til it's empty...\n\n[Bridge]\nI rep N-Y, I'm so Bedstuy!\nSome claim that Crips, I'm rep the 5\nI live by the rules, I ain't fake no moves\nNever one shot! - You can get the whole damn room!\n\n[Verse]\nCause I keep the ratchet with me! Keep the ratchet with me!\nTote it on the reggy, I'm a lean 'em if they test me\nMove like Makaveli, keep it in my Pelle-Pelle\nGot the Se-Se-Se-Se-Semi sippin' Henny, come an' get me!\nA Deli Machede, I'll poke you in ya belly\nPut the Hammer in your mouth like - Akinyele!\nYou peanut-butter, jelly! - I'm Fonzarelly Willy\nTry me, I'll put somethin' in your top like Skelly\nI'm so 'Stuy, I'm so deadly; why you think these rappers worry\nChase 'em like - Tom & Jerry, little girl, R. Kelly!\nHit 'em in a hurry, you get cremated or buried\nThough I get alot of Feddi, I want more like Demi\nStart frontin' and bustin' cause we be straight stuntin'!\nYou don't want nothin', hit your brother and your cousin\nHave these lames front tuckin' when we get the gun clutchin'!\nWe touch 'em! Shoot in the head! - Infrared...\n\n[Bridge]\n\n[Hook] [beat fades-out]", "year": null}]}
