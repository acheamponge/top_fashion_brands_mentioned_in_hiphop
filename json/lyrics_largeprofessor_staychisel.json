The wise man, the fool or the warrior\nWell if all of their minds are chisel, then all of them\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Large Professor]\nI stay chiseled, like Snoop Dogg, fo' shizzle my nizzle\nIn them hardcore streets I'm a straight official\nSix pack, don motivator, throwing the weight up\nKid tried to front so I showed him straight up\nHad his whole click flabbergasted\nWay I was cutting 'em up, one kid yelled out \"Grab the bastard\"\nTried to rush me, luckily I wasn't rusty\nPulled out, served 'em all up like a custy\nCouldn't go out, highway with a blow out\nLike Frank, I did it my way, nigga, no doubt\nLarge billionaire and I'm still here\nWriting rhymes for the sphere, I do not feel fear\nYou heard, I'm the dude on the porch with the herb\nAnd I tell you right now, kid, soft is a word\nThat don't describe me, what y'all know that's this lively\nBarbecue 2, Nas right here beside me (with Akinyele)"}], "artist": "Large Professor"}
