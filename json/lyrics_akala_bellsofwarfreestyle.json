To be hung from trees?\nWe been whipped, been stripped of our truth\nBut we still standin', a tree without roots\nBlack rose from the concrete, the petals is damaged\nBut surely you see the beauty of what just happened\nWhat don't kill you, make a nigga strong, that's a fact\nAnd we've been abused for so long, you do the math", "year": null, "album": "The War Mixtape", "image": "https://images.genius.com/85a1a9e929a1b07df16e80960429050f.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
