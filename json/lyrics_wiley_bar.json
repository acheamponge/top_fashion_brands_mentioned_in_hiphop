I'm sorry, you can't\nWarrior charge, warrior charge (ye ye)\nI spit bars, I don't throw darts\nThem type of games, I don't take part\nMan smokes lemon, man smoke gelat'\nAin't got a bass, got a rack, it's a blast from the past\nMade the verse then mixed the parts\nFive cards laid down on the tables, still I can't see no hearts\nDon't say nothin' when you see me walk past\nWe spot a dog there, always on guard\nMight switch it up, start spitting in yards\nAlways getting involved, you're too fast\nNot from the same place but worlds apart\nIf you don't want to see the end, don't start\n\n[Chorus: Wiley]\nI don't know why but I won't ever bar\nThree times a week I go to a bar\nI keep some money inside a gold bar\nThe bar was low, so I lift the bar\nAnytime I got too much on, that's a par\nLime on top of shots at the bar\nI know you weren't sure if I would go far\n\n[Verse 3: D Double E]\nOh my word\nYo, I spit a 16 bar, hot like tar\nSoon be a star, get very far\nNever gonna go away, permanent scar\nTrust me, this lyric is no joke lyric\nWhen I draw my lyric\nMake your new lyric look very old like a no go lyric\nA make no dough lyric\nCan't match, if you think you can\nGonna draw for the war lyrics\nBetter go and get more lyrics\nAnd make sure that they're your lyrics\nThere will never be a day when I spit poor lyrics\nIn war, draw 24 more lyrics\nSpit like a Magnum .44 lyric\nHit you in the chest, leave you on the floor lyric\nNext time, never ignore war lyrics\nLike heavy rain, yeah, I pour raw lyrics\n\n[Chorus: Wiley]\nI don't know why but I won't ever bar\nThree times a week I go to a bar\nI keep some money inside a gold bar\nThe bar was low, so I lift the bar\nAnytime I got too much on, that's a par\nLime on top of shots at the bar\nI know you weren't sure if I would go far\n\n[Outro: Wiley]\nCame in the game with a tenner for the subs\nSave \u00a360, go cut two dubs\nCame in the game with a tenner for the subs\nSave \u00a360, go cut two dubs\nBBK\nAll day, every day, BBK\nAyy, BBK\nAll day, every day, BBK\nWe're on the mic\nMaximum's on the CDJs\nBBK\nYeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d498a13cfb08ff2a64ba27cf8333fc0c.800x800x1.jpg", "album": "Godfather II", "title": "Bar"}]}
