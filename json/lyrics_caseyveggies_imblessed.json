When that car hit you, your dad and I almost lost our minds. But faith and prayer got us through. And your attitude. It was your attitude, the way you handled it, let me know that you were going to be special. Your granny and nanny always prayed over you and your brother. We are blessed\n\n[Casey Veggies]\nI just want to leave y'all with something, you know what I mean. I just wanna let y'all know that we're blessed. If you got a dream, follow your dream. Don't let nobody tell you you can't get it. Keep grinding. Keep shining. Keep being blessed. Let's get it"}]}
