I could be wrong, but pupils don't lie\nAnd if they do, by God, they must fry (Fry?)\nYou know, like electric chair\nThe way you stare, yeah, I'm there\nYou committed a crime and I'm the victim\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nI've got an eye out for she that cries out passionately\nWe'll do things backwardly, forwardly, horizontally\nI'm too young to be settlin' down\nQuick to change my mind tomorrow\nSo, now can I borrow your timid torso\nMore so than your soul? Honest me, gotta be how I roll\nFuck the rhythm, tuck the rhythm under your bosom\nYou're the prism, Shirley Chisholm\nWas the first, let's rehearse makin' a baby\nPut in your order, I want a baby daughter\nDance on the tip of my tongue\nShake the clouds until there's no more wetness in them\nTell your homegirls that you will send them\nA postcard from 3000, hard\n\n[Chorus 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nDon't want to make you feel strange, but\nDon't let these words be in vain\nSo spread, spread for me\n(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)\nNature knows that I want you, but\nNot unless you want me too\nSo spread, spread for me\n(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus 1: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nI don't want to move too fast, but\nCan't resist your sexy ass\nJust spread, spread for me\n(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)\nDon't want to come on too strong, but\nI'll play in you all day long\nJust spread, spread for me\n(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)\n\n[Chorus 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nDon't want to make you feel strange, but\nDon't let these words be in vain\nSo spread, spread for me\n(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)\nNature knows that I want you, but\nNot unless you want me too\nSo spread, spread for me\n(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)\n\n[Outro: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nThe morning after..."}], "artist": "Andr\u00e9 3000"}
