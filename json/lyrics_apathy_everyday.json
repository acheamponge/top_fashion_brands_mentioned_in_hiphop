It can't be. What? Damn, is that right?\nHis daughter is the girl you fucked last night?\nThat's amazing! What a coincidence\nFunny how incidence like this ruin girl's innocence\nIf he knew what he held so sacred\nHad been desecrated he would be filled with hatred\nProbably wanna hang himself in the basement\nInstead of trying to face it\nThank God you taped it\nTomorrow won't be so average\nCause he's gonna get a real special package\nAnd it really won't matter the amount\nCause you sent it out underneath the company's account", "year": null}]}
