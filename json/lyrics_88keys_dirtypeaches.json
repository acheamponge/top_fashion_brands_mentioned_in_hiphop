Let's Go!\n\n[Pre-Verse]\nSweet and sticky juicy thang\nSummer comes and there you hang\nDamn, can I taste you?\nNot so ripe, but I can't wait\nWant you dripping down my face\nPlease don't make me chase you\n\n[Verse 1]\nCan't control my appetite, right\nWhen you tell me no\nThere I go\nDoing what I shouldn't do\nBarely know my wrong from rights\nCrossed the lines to satisfy\nSome hunger, great\nJust to taste the way you used to\n\n[Chorus]\nHey, maybe because the deepest\nPiece of all her sweetness\nAin't nothing but dirty peaches, boy\nI guess nobody ever told you\nNo, you ain't supposed to\nDo how you do\n(Repeat)\n\n[Verse 2]\nGushy, sugar pop\nEvery little drip and drop\nI wish I had the decency to stop\nAnd I can't control my appetite, right\nWhen you tell me no\nI take a bite\nAnd wonder why you start to cry\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bridge]\nDon't do the things you do\nDon't do the things you do\n'Cause this little girl may grow up\nMissing all of her sweetness\nIf you dirty up her peaches too soon, too soon\n\n[Refrain]\nDon't you, do what you doing boy, don't do what you do\nDon't you, do what you doing boy, don't do what you do\nD-Don't you, do what you doing boy, don't do what you do\nDon't do what you do\nOh, don't do what you doing man, don't do what you do\n\n[Outro]\nOh my God, I forgot to tell you what else happened last night!\nAdam only had a three-pack of Magnums, and he totally ran out!\nBut ole girl was like \"Don't worry about it, baby! I'm on birth control! I'm clean! I'm good! Let's go!\"", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/36bd6f7c9c038652449c033bb7088bd1.700x700x1.jpg", "year": "2008-11-11", "title": "Dirty Peaches"}]}
