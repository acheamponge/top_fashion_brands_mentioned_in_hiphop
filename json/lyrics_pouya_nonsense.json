I gave you no respect\nBitch\n\n[Verse 1: Pouya]\nThis don't make no sense\nWhy don't you let me meet your friends\nMy dick on full, I'm lurking, searching for a cum recipient\nThem ho's around the corner lookin' eighteen plus or older\nI walk over with my shoulders held up high like I'm a soldier\nBitch, I told ya, never do what I'm supposed to\nDon't dap me up boy, I do not know you\nWe get buck inside Miami like no other, motherfucker let me show you\nFeelin' myself when I roll through\nHear what I'm sayin' or go through\nI am the one that she go to\nEatin' the pussy like tofu\nWhere my money at?\nPull up to your cul-de-sac\nHop out of the whip with a couple of girls, you gonna have you a heart attack\nYou could look baby girl, but don't touch my stacks\nDon of summer, Baby Bone, I work so hard for that\nBitch, who the fuck is you?\nNo you can't hang with my crew\nShout out to the boys from Memphis, Tennessee, I fucks with you\nHo, it ain't hard to see\nThat them boys tryna be me\nKnow this ain't figure of speech\nSuck my thang, just like a leech\nTeaching the youth, I'm just spittin' the truth\nStressin' me but I ain't worried about you\nWhy is you always concerned what I do\nActing like one of my bitches would do\nHop out of the bushes, I got me a few\nKilla's, cap peelers, all you heard was pew\nCircle so tight, only fuck with a few\nBustin' you gushin' up out of your tube, bitch\n\n[Hook: Pouya]\nShe suck my thang slow that's that turtle neck\nI make bitches fall in love through the internet\nAlready thankin' who next while I'm having sex\nHow you still in love with me? I gave you no respect\nBitch, this don't make no sense\nWhat the fuck?\nBitch, this don't make no sense\nWhat you talking bout?\nBitch, this don't make no sense\nYuh\nBitch, this don't make no sense\nThis don't make no sense\nBitch, this don't make no sense\nWhat the fuck?\nBitch, this don't make no sense\nYuh yuh yuh\nBitch, this don't make no sense\nWhat you talking 'bout?\nBitch, this don't make no sense\nThis don't make no sense\nOh, no no\nShe suck my thang slow that's that turtle neck\nI make bitches fall in love through the internet\nAlready thankin' who next while I'm having sex\nHow you still in love with me?
