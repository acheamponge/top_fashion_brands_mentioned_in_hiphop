Vanilla Ice\nForthcomin' I'm risin' to the top\nThe real definition of funk is put to hip hop\nThat's what I though, you're cause by the friction\nPens to the pad when I'm shakin' the mixin'\nWhat I like to hear is a drummer get wicked\nThe tone of a vocal thrown and then kick it\nDon't be surprised if your eyeballs swell\nI know it's hard to regard cause I'm loved by the females\nMasses of many, which is plenty, comes to a halt\nNo one's in the runnin', so I guess that is my fault\nSo pump up the crowd and give 'em somethin' to step to\nMy dj's at his max to enhance what I bring you\nThe concepts hittin' so follow along like a cookbook\nAcknowledge the pros from all the titles I took, yea\nThe crowd's at ease when I breat through the mic end\nAs I whip up a dance better move all the mic stands\nI go to work on the floor like a wet mop\nIf you've ever been moved, check it out when I rock\n\nChorus\n\n[Verse 3]\nThrow your hands in the air and let's get hyper\nFlip this thing and sting like a viper\nRollin' with the rhythm, I did it for my opponent\nIf there was a crown to be taken, yea, I would own it\nBelieve that my rhyme is spoken like it has to be\nWith slang to stain it's a sheer catastrophe\nSheer to the point, to the point it's like lethal\nThe dope that I'm sellin' is not even illegal\nBut, still knowck you out with clout to make you shout\nTo rock the party people sho 'em what it's all about\nMoney, yea, is the key to all problems\nIf you believe that, then you should surely solve 'em\nCause I got the key, the key to attack\nThe knowledge from my dome, from the top of my track\nTo my foes, I can show I can flow cause I'm legit\nThinkin' of a new dance, ice will be workin' it\n\n[Hook]", "album": "To the Extreme", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5078fff4f8c0f4d1704f492654dc4064.1000x1000x1.jpg"}]}
