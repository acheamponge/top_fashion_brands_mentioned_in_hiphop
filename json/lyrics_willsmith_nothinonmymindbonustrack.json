Yo, I don't know, care if none of my friends come\nA hat and shades go out and try to blend some, yeah right\nDays off is hard to come by\nEspecially for Hollywood's number one guy\nSo let me get to movin', while the sun is high\nMy cell is off, two-way is off\nIt's yearly crazy, today is gravy\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2 - Will Smith]\nHalf awake and half asleep\nAs I watch the sun, it slightly moved a little past its peak\nAnd I feel like Tom Hanks but it's perfect, I'm a \"Cast Away\"\nAgenda full of nothin' but stuff to pass today\nMy sister asked me to cook somethin'\nBut that would fall into the category of doin' somethin'\nAnd I done already said to ya'll that I ain't doin' nothin'\nSo let me say it again to be clea,r I ain't doin' nothin'\nHmm, phew, a breather\nI meant what I meant, when I said, when I said it's all leisure\nNeither, chart toppin' crowd pleaser\nPhone rang Jada said, \"Uhh he's uhh,\" I ain't home, so turn that phone off\nCome and sit on my lap, and take a load off\nAnd lay down into my arms, and we could doze off\nTo work as much as I work, I must be thrown off, what a day\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Tra-Knox]\nYo, yo, yo, mic check, mic check\nAh, that's cool\n\n[Will Smith]\nThat's hot right\n\n[Tra-Knox]\nYeah, alright I'm gonna do the umm\n\n[Will Smith]\nHey Ramon help me out dog\n\n[Tra-Knox]\nThis is hot\n\n[Will Smith]\nYo chief, yo Tone, come on\n\n[Hook]\nNothin's on my mind - 25X", "image": "https://images.genius.com/76048d37e73e3e383749923c401de4f0.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Born to Reign", "title": "Nothin\u2019 on My Mind (Bonus Track)"}]}
