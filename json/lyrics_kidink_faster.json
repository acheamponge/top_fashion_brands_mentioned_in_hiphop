Are you sure you wanna try it?\n\n[Hook]\nFaster, faster, faster, faster\n\n[Verse 2]\nSay you wanna live faster, faster, I got what you asked for\nAll around the world, baby, hope you got your passports\nGoin' outta town, gotta leave in the early morn'\nI ain't even pack, all I need is a carry-on\nI know this sound very strong\nBut I might just bring my Mary on\nLeave your friends, so depressing like a Mary song\nStill impressed by the suites at the Marriott\nCome and let me upgrade you\nBad bitch sniffin' round, and she hit the nasal\nGirls gone wild, taking shots from the navel\nSomewhere overseas, man, my name's Mr. Navel\nPeace"}]}
