(Awww, yeah)\n(Bite me, harder, harder, harder!)\nGrr.. Grr.. Grrr\n\n[Verse: Tech N9ne]\nShe don't even know, the lil' mean girl\nGet carried away and bite her to let her blood stream flow\nAccidentally leave her cold el ni\u00f1o\nPinot noir gushing out of this teen ho\nAt 19 shouldn't be so damn freaky\nBut they on it and they want it\nHit them split then leave 'em leaky\nBut this particular chick poonani's thick and beefy\nRich and seepy, oh yes I have a female animal beneath me\nShe all in it then she told a nigga to bite her neck\nI'm excited cause the gush will give my nut the right effect\nBut where will I hide a set of double D's\nIt I try to get her jugular open, I'm gonna keep with the pokin'\nHave to really be strokin' her all night, I'm wet\nSunk my teeth in, bitches in heat send me over the top they get hot\nThen I gotta bring the beast in\nShe knows not what she ask or what this night be\nThis might be the day that she die cause she told an animal to..\n\n[Hook: Jessica Slankard] (2X)\nBite me, excite me\nJust bite me, not lightly\nI hope the scar is forever, baby I'm getting wetter\nThe harder, the better!"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
