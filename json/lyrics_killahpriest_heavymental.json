We're Almost There\nJust try to prepare and adapt to the air pressure\nNow we searching for the mental treasure\nPleasure beyond the measure of yards\nYou can't comprehend a god or the distance between stars\nPicking up quasars inside the radar\nAs we're going far past any astronaut\nMoving so fast in this aircraft everything we pass get hot\nFrom the take-off, the blast turn the glass into rocks\nAt last, my supreme task was to no longer walk on green grass\nUntil I become a beam of gas and travel through extreme draft\nUnable to be picked up through cable\nOut of the reach of all manners of sky examiners\nHeaven scanners, giant antennas and high tech space cameras\nNo evidence in any cemetery obituary\nNot found in any library or dictionary or encyclopedia or media\nI'm in star mode with the discipline of Damo\nI broke the U.S. bar code\nNow I'm on Allah's road to journey into realms of the cosmos\nWhere only God knows or goes\nBlow like the UFO to give up my work clothes\nOnly to glow with a holy robe and explode through the mysterious black holes\nDeep warp through the outer zone without a phone to the unknown\nTo sit on my throne alone, Heavy Mental\nThe pilot on this galactic plane of knowledge\nThrough culture, my sculpture lights up in ultraviolet\nSo you can see my brain is symbolic to a palace\nTherefore, I keep my hair stylish\nMy flesh solid and my teeth polished\nNext stage, examine my x-ray\nTake notes for your essay and let the cassette play for longer than a decade\nAs we begin to blaze through the Milky Ways\nRepent from our filthy ways, replenish from the guilty days\nThe eyeballs swell up to size of eggs\nNeon dreamland, wing span 7 feet\nBetween my eyes is the beak\nDestination of the riders to reach is the peak\nAngelical landscape will take the physical man behind the hidden gates of space\nUltimate escapes as we go through a phenomenal rate\nAs we cruise going into magnitude\nAs we break up into a multitude of molecules\nGoing through a long hollow tube with a scholar's view\nAs we wearing the white garment\nPassing sound waves that's supersonic\nPassing the comets, star clusters\nChanging my physical structure till my lips begin to pucker\nKissing Christ at the Last Supper\nGrabbing the brass cup of wine, (Heavy Mental)\nI feel myself getting older\nSitting on my sofa in the position like yoga\nTill my mind passes over the solar system\nMy wisdom novas, I am the controller\nI begin to loosen up my shoulders\nForming each joint into the Sun's 8 points\nThen I begin to rise like helium, escaping the Millennium 2000\nMeditating to the soft notes of a violin\nI've been on Mars\nBuilding the holy synagogues for the royal seminars\nLong before they had the renaissance, there existed a Hebrew lodge\nHeavy Mental\nA phenomenon from out of the matrix\nThe world looks at me with envy and hatred\nJust because I appear to them half naked\nRising into a spaceship with an arm full of solid gold bracelets\nA phenomenon from out of the matrix, Heavy Mental\n\n[Outro: Killah Priest]\nNow the only time - Heavy Mental\nThe only time you should catch.. Heavy Mental\nOnly time, you could have jet lag is if your cassette drag\nHeavy Mental\nBarak ahthah Yahawah wa Yahawashi -  Heavy Mental\nYo, just chill - Heavy Mental\nStop the tape - Heavy Mental\n(STOP IT!) Heavy Mental"}]}
