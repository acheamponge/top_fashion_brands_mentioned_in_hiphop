Yeah!\nEveryday I decide and find a way to say everything on my mind\nLearn everything I could find and always remain fly\nI'm Wikipedia and Expedia at the same damn time\nYou got i's better dot'em where I'm headed\nOr you'll be like drunk texting your X's\nYou know your gonna regret it\nRight now they asking who X is?\nBut soon they will not forget it\nI'm living long as a legend\nEnjoying every second\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Hook 2]"}], "artist": "XV"}
