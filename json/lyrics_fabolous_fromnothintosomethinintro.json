Yesssss... we winnin again\n\n[Fabolous]\nI'm ridin through the metropolitan, everybody hollerin\nMe I'm just acknowledgin, with this million dollar grin\nShine like a halogen, cool as the island wind\nI don't judge myself but if I do I'd give my style a ten\nMet a chick, who belong, on front of Cosmopolitan\nThick in the right place, otherwise she model thin\nShe don't do no swallowin, but she got a wilder friend\nWho don't give a fuck, I told both of them to follow then\nI'm with the familia, you might be familiar\nWith a few faces but they still the nine milli-ya\nThey be like the Young Guns, so I guess I'm Billy bruh\nI do more than William Bryant, I'm a little Willie-er\nChange a little chillier, wrist a little sillier\nAnd I'm grown, so I'm not, really the, kid at all\nBut I hope you get it y'all, I can't say I did it all\nBut believe that 'fore I leave it I'mma try to get it all\nWhat I don't get at all, is what these critics call\nStuntin, don't mean nuttin, they don't live her like they read it y'all\nIt ain't the car, it's the way it's kitted y'all\nMeanin it's the little things, like the way my fitted fall\nThe way my posture lean, the way my necklace hang\nYou should respect this gang, if not expect this bang\nBut all this wreckless slang, it don't effect us mayne\nThey build you up to break you down, it's just like Tetris mayne~!\nThat's why I sex Ms. Thang, and let the next miss hang\nAnd even if I wake up late I do the breakfast thang\nThat's an important meal, I is the important deal\nJay brought me to Def Jam, feel like it's a Jordan deal\nI'm young Melo game-winning young fellow\nRemember me, I mixed one white with one yellow\nTurned nuttin into somethin, you can do it too\nThis the music that you do it to, 'Lo-so", "title": "From Nothin\u2019 to Somethin\u2019 Intro"}]}
