Aye aye aye yo aye 1, 2, 3 Bitch!!\n\n[Verse: 1]\nBad life, fast life\nYou don't have seven\nYou don't hace five\nIn my uncle's car\nWith my demons are\nPut the shotgun in my arm\n\n[Verse: 2]\nLove me\nHate me\nBut never forget me\nMy mind\nMy time\nMy life, it's over now\nIt's time to say... Game over, home'\nDreams are broken\nDreams are stopped\n'Cause i'm stupid now\nCome come\n\n[Outro]\nI keep writing letters for you\nEven knowing that you will never read them\nI keep listening to our songs\nI'm still thinking about you\nYou will always have a place in my heart\nEven if you do not want to be there\nAlthough you are not here anymore", "album": " The Classics"}], "artist": "SadBoyTaki"}
