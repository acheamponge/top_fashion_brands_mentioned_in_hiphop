Hush your lip.  Wanna be a pimp?  [?]\nSuck a dick.  Lick a clit.  Razorblades - cut your wrists\nSwollen up, chest big, steroids, you know it is\nHe said what?  Say it again.  She said what?  Say it again\nWho you with?  You with her?  He with you?  You with them?\nOh well!  Aw hell!  Fired up!  Ring the bell!\nLight a gun, [?] the shell, and my aim at [?]\nOne shot to the head, motherfucker, and you know he's dead\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2012-02-02"}]}
