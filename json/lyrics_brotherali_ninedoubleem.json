You got the wrong season\nYou got your piece, I got my piece\nAnd all I need now is a reason, for me to start squeezing\nMatter of fact, give me your rings, watch, and your house keys\nAnd make it fast shorty, or I'mma put gun smoke, up in the breeze\nAnd I'm glad he ain't call my bluff, because I ain't really had my gat\nIt wouldn't have been nothing, for him, to peel back\nMy wig, he saw this piggy go, wee-wee all the way home\nTo get my chrome, because now I got to lock some shots off in that dome\n(Why's that?) Because my manhood has got to stay intact\nHe can't just play me out, in front of the ladies, that shit is wack\nBut now I got my gat, back down in the downtown district\nDying to spill some gravy on this mother{*cough*} biscuit\nSeen him kicking it out on Nicklet, like it was nothin'\nGo around the block one more time, and I swear to God I'm dumpin'\nLooked over my shoulder, know this was the time and the place\nI jumped out the car, unloaded the nine up in his face!\nWith no feelin', peelin' out, tires all squeelin'\nAdrenalin to my brain, got me higher than the ceilin'\nBut people talk, I'll probably never get dissed again\nAnd Minnesota got ten thousand lakes, to dump the pistol in\n\n[Hook]\nWoah\nWa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang, listen to my nine millimeter go bang (Go-o bang!) (x3)\n\nWa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang, listen to my nine millimeter go bang\n\n[Verse 2]\nI ran home quick, changed my clothes and dipped in my lady's Trans-Am\nIf they ask you where I am don't tell em shit\nYou ain't seen me or heard from me; she asked where I would go\nI said: \"You know I'mma go stay with grandma down in Chicago\nI know how fast your car go, way up over a hundred\nBut I can't get caught speeding, I might be federally wanted\"\nMan them cops be on it, I can't afford to get sloppy\nCause if I slip up at any single point, yo they got me\nSo I rock the accelerator never greater than limit\nThinking strictly about my journey, what I did, still hasn't hit me\nI touch down in the Chi, grandma stay on Southside\nJust trying to get some rest after that eight hour drive\nAnd Grandma surprised, but always happy to see me\nSo I'm kicked up at the rest, playing Nintendo, watching T.V\nAnd believe me, I know that I'm still on the run\nBut I'm happy that this part of the ghetto way is done\nBecause I:\n\n[Hook]\nRat-ta-tat, rat-ta-tat, rat-ta-tat, tatta rat-ta-ta-tatta to make his blood\nSplatter (x4)\n\nWoah\nWa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang, listen to my nine millimeter go bang (Go-o bang!) (x3)\n\nWa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang, listen to my nine millimeter go bang\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, it's kind of hard to live with what I did\nBecause everytime I close my eyes, all I see is me blasting that kid\nBut yo, I did exactly what I had to do\nIf that was him in my shoes; he would've blasted me too\nBesides, everybody's mamma cry sometime\nAnd you know everyone got to die sometime\nAnd grandma said I had a cousin in Minnesota, that I ain't even know about, you know\nAnd just last week, he got his brains blown out\nAnd so his little funeral was being held today\nI'm dressed in black Versacci, and mad respect I pay\nBut whoever shot my cousin, sure wet up that po' bastard\nBecause the wake and the funeral was strictly closed casket\nBut yo, they had his picture on the program, and oh damn\nThey had his picture on the program, and oh damn\nStared at my cousin on that program, and I couldn't even speak\nThat's the kid that I shot last week\n\n[Hook]\nWoah\nWa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang, listen to my nine millimeter go bang (Go-o bang!) (x3)\n\nWa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang, listen to my nine millimeter go bang\n\nRat-ta-tat, rat-ta-tat, rat-ta-tat, tatta rat-ta-ta-tatta to make his blood\nSplatter (x4)", "year": null, "album": "Rites of Passage"}], "artist": "Brother Ali"}
