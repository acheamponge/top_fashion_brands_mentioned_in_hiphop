son\nThis is my man Nas Escobar\nAnd I go by the name of Cormega you know\n(you gonna get your self murdered)\nYo check this out on the real son\nAnybody diss the Firm yo on the real yo\nI'm bringing it to you I ain't even saying the word\nCause I ain't allowed to say it on the radio\n(any Firm members come out your mouth wrong)\nWe keepin' it crazy real son on the real\n(violate the grand you get split in half)\nSon you gonna set it? set it son\nMatter of fact though\n\n[Nas]\n\nI peep you frontin, I was in the Jeep\nSunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'\nAcross the street you was wildin'\nTalkin bout how you ran the Island in eighty-nine\nLayin up, playin the yard with crazy shine\nI cocked a baby 9 that nigga grave be mine, clanked him\nWhat was he thinkin on my corner when it's pay me time\nDug em you owe me cousin somethin told me plug him\nSo dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb\nSpun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son\nCaught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come\nThen they came askin me my name, what the ugh\nI got stitched up and went through\nLeft the hospital that same night, what\nGot my gat back, time to backtrack\nI had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped\nBlack was in the Jeep watchin all these scenes speed by\nIt was a brown Datsun, and yo nobody in my hood got one\nThat clown cat's through, blazin at his crew\n\nI can't believe it achieve\nYo Cormega whatever whatever whatever\n\n[Cormega]\nPushin' a red lex\nWith many screams inside the headsets\nSo much beef, police surprised I ain't dead yet\nI keep red tech in the passenger seat\nTo match their heat\nIt's so real if I don't see you I'm splashing your beep\nIt's on the kid\nWhoever gets his first\nIt's going to kids dirt\nMy soldiers be cold blooded vultures\nAnd cold blooded\nYo on the street we control hundreds\nI drink polatas so all my people roll blunted\nYour man froze when I rolled up\nI symbolize death like a cobra\nAttacks your life here it's over\nBlack you effed up\nNever should've messed up\nMy black cocksucker scared to die tough luck\nYou know my steelo im like Al Pacino\nYo Nas Escobar grab the mic and flex a bar\n\n[Nas]\nI'm in the black limo\nJack Daniel through the crack window\nI spot the fake red dot his face like a Hindu\nGrab the symbol\nShow examples to make examples\nEssential amounts you owe to the fam crew\nFirm affiliation paper chasing\nChip glossy rich pablo es cubano\nSophisticano\nYo blazing halos like shadow\nYo nigga im the castro\nIm coming through on your wack crew\nWhat you gonna do\nCormega pick the mic come through\n\n[Cormega]\n\nAy yo I get mines\nWell enough to be considered big time\nMy crew a chosen few legit minds\nWho live prime\nShorty's on some fly stuff\nAdmitted that can't resist mines\nMahogany complexion\nBody probably dressed in\nMy ill tommy hill collection\nWhen I be flexin', sketch it\nMy selection of words are type effective\nWhen I rhyme words are verbalized remain present\nIn mines, I'm like an with air macs nikes on\nRecite nice on mics strike like a python\nMy gold chain with ice on lookin' trife on\nMy Jacuzzi filled with tight warm relaxed lookin steaming\nLounging like a falcon on a mountain top at Egypt\nCats schemin when they see my rocks gleaming\nMega shine forever rhyme wicked like a demon\nWhere my charcoal, new balance a lot yo\nThe narcs go knocked my man Marco\nHis money was marked yo\nI regulate a sharp flow\nBut in my life bucaso\nMy mom died when I was five and never left my heart yo\nI symbolize rive alive niggas\nGhetto's where I live\nConsidered my rhyme the oasis\nBecause rap was a desert\nAnd I helped minds escaped it\nYo Nas link it up it's like an ill typed bracelet\n\n[Nas]\n\nFake thug, no love\nYou get the slug, CB4 Gusto\nYour luck low\nI didn't know til I was drunk though\nYou freak cats get played out\nGet robbed and laid out\nProstitute turned snitch\nI got the gauge out\n96 ways I made out, Montana way\nThe Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray\nDipped attache, jumped out the Range\nEmpty out the ashtray\nA glass of 'ze make a man Cassius Clay\nRed dot plots, thirty-two shots\nYa'll niggas don't want none of this\n\n[Cormega]\n\nAyo check it my man Joe Shan is downstairs\nMy man Georgie is lounging downstairs\nMy man Big Ice he lounging in Queensbridge\nAnd all you real cats know what time it is\nOn the real all you crabs cats know the deal\nOn the real all you crabs cats know the deal\nOn the real all you crabs cats know the deal\nNow check the new verse\nCheck the new verse it's ill\nYo my millennium got people mind prisoner\nPain digital wood brain material\nRims spin sinister\nGrin like John Dillinger\nIced out medallions my style will keep killin' ya\nMisery and jealousy when you envision me\nI'm getting mines and still livin' on the strength of me\nYou never bust nothin' or got ill touched nothin'\nMy baby face ice grill I heard something for real\nIn any cipher i'll serve em like a viper\nI go for mines like I go for time on Rikers\nSteelo like pacino benzino benz bilo we know\nPeople we dope like mafiaso like gambino\nWhere Sergio Tacchinio took a jab in a casino\nI like sony cause they saw my man keeno\nCan't forget my home girl Faith Newman\nShe be boomin'\nMy people they representing\nEvery percent in\nIn my firm team\nWe so ill our people burn cream\nRhymes I design\nCan make your mind turn fiend\nI respect green I breath\nFor keepin Queen regulatin'\nNas be regulatin'\nSmoother type regulations\nYo Escobar grab the mic just like you flex a car\nYou know my style son we in here ye ye\n\n[Nas]\n\nYo no doubt Cormega get in for the firm biz\nStraight out the bridge peace to my man Havoc\nYou know what I'm saying\nI know you going

know life has tied me man\nYo I lived the life of 62 pick ups\nPumping on corners beat downs and stick ups\nSeeing events in which you have to stay silent\nMurder extortion and all types of violence\nYo kids living a life ghetto heaven\nSelling cracks getting ready to attack with nines and mac elevens\nYou know my style\nYou can't stop what knocks me down\nPeace to AZ, Nas, and figure Foxy Brown\nMy whole firm team is ill no doubt\nI can't forget the commissioner he's called Steve Stoute\nWith the ill benz\nHe rocks the ill dimes and ill rims\nYou know my steelo\nI'm like Al Pacino\nGod bless the life of my man nino\n\n[Nas]\n\nIt's sort of like the conclusion to \"Color Purple\"\nBrothas is losing, confusion, with one time all pursuit moves in\nGrabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit\nCop verses the block, shorties is too quick\nLesson number one. If you're arrested and hung\nWhere Brothas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue\nIt's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer\nThe violent words of a prince in a palace of Persia\nThe cognac plurger plus the trees\nBut whose the faul one to make his nose take a freeze\nAnd got enough gold to rock ice in all hype\nUsed to be a general but just lost his stripe\nPipe dreams and white feinds and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers\nAstoria walls with cypress, but yo that's another subject\nI love teks let's get it off\nYo what up what up\n\n[Cormega]\n\nYo funkmaster flex you know I got the ill lex\nI wear my guests in apendix\nAnd cash my cheque in flesh shit\nMy man escobar be lighting a weed\nAnd I proceed with all the ill types of rhymes you need\nI'm not the new jack, or crew rack I'm like the next man\nCormega, I just got signed to Def Jam\nMy man Nas is down with me\nA lot of sucker rappers they can't diss me\nIt's like that, you know it's like that\nWe'll strike back Queensbridge style\nMy mobb deep people is mad foul\nA juvenile delinquent wet your prequit\nI get my money numerous occasions\nIt's frequent my man Ike\nTried to avalanche ice watch\nYou know my steelo Al Pacino\nYo Escobar\n\n[Nas/Cormega]\nEscobar season\nCormega 4 reason\nWe with it what\nI'll stay high triple beamin\nQueensbridge"}], "artist": "Nas"}
