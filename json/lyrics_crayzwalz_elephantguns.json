And when shove comes to push\nYou just a punk who wanna bust your gun like \u201cWoah.  Look\u201d\nYou illiterate bastard.  Consider this classic\nYou fabricate madness but can\u2019t look past traffic\nTricksy Sm\u00e9agols scheme for the precious resource\nWith that, the talent people secrete coughs\nLoud flickies that squeeze soft\nOr go around, come around \u2018til you founding me corpse.  Peep the deep thoughts\nMarch on end\u2014no dawn for men\nArmies swarm and form crop cirles.  Then again\nThey plotting stocks and bonds when the drop the bombs\nI\u2019m like \u201cYo, stop the song\u201d \u2018cause my block is Nam.  And if I\nPopped your thong, it\u2019s a fact you pussycats\nGet clapped by the crowd at the hands with Iraq\nNow I rock between a dark place and bionic traits\nSpit shit \u2018til my lips drip toxic waste\nReptilians with AKs in front of bagel buffet\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.  They\u2019re only here to make sure the streets is safe\u201d\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nYour heart pump Kool-Aid.  My thoughts cut toup\u00e9es\nYou don\u2019t really want nothing over there\nThey got elephant guns.  Too bad\nElephant guns full-blast\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nI\u2019ll take the Brooklyn Bridge now.  \u201cCash or credit?\u201d\nLaser math or debit?  They edit, sketch\nAnd only show you the game from the players\u2019 lane perspective\n\u201cThe Specialist.\u201d  Stay setting the segment\nEncyclopedia-bright, my media write\nLike the verse, down to Earth like a meteorite\nBurst the curse and don\u2019t believe what the media hypes\n\u2018Cause they the first to fade to black at the speed of your life\nAnd the cold ice current left the stereos froze\nIn this land of milk and honey with no cereal bowl\nThe theory is old.  I see the light of old scheme acting\nCrying wolf pack screaming, \u201cFire-breathing dragon!\u201d\nAnd the kids on the school bus is Waco fiends\nFrom coffeehead killers out to take your cream\nGet a clip.  But what you spit don\u2019t even matter\u2014you trash\nNow that it\u2019s really time to ball, we gonna shatter the glass\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nYour heart pump Kool-Aid.  My thoughts cut toup\u00e9es\nYou don\u2019t really want nothing over there\nThey got elephant guns.  Too bad\nElephant guns full-blast\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nI went to the dojo to slice for slow flow\nBring it to the heart of your hood like the Champion logo\nScience this wild\u2014the molecules merging.  The message is certain\nPress 1 if you satisfied, 2 if it\u2019s urgent\nIt\u2019s really your soul on the line\u2014they still got it tabbed, so\nMaybe you should go online, search\u2014then you get it back, yo\nI can feel it in my veins like a heroine rush\n\u2018Bout to self-combust for the Exxon bus\nBut don\u2019t trust \u2018cause the next one us\nWar on the poor (Yes, y\u2019all) for more surplus\nYou stuck?  Don\u2019t remain in the clutch\u2014they shift panels\nThis time, it\u2019s commandos versus camels\nNow light candles for the loved ones gone\nGetting biochemically engineered on\u2014they pawns\nSad song.  This is fornication\nUnder consent of the king.  E.D. vertically\nFire out the sky for the fuel in the ground\nAnd what goes up must come down and crash and sound\nAt Red Dawn, hear hunters platoon for funds\nFor fun, they killing ants with elephant guns\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nYour heart pump Kool-Aid.  My thoughts cut toup\u00e9es\nYou don\u2019t really want nothing over there\nThey got elephant guns.  Too bad\nElephant guns full-blast\n\n[Outro: C-Rayz Walz]\nBelief.  Subtle.  So galactic.
