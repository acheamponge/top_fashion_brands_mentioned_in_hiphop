Time marches on\nStill nothing stays the same, I'm so focused\nGrabbing hold to every moment\nGetting my stance, this is the chance, don't blow it\nFake none, this is what you waited for from day one\nMake no mistake, son, I pray when the day come\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ec81fe76ab1184b20e5472621f8a9698.497x394x1.jpg", "album": null, "year": null}]}
