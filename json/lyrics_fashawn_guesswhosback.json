I had no reason to\nArt minus the easel, I'm unbelievable\nFled the coast just to change the climates, Cayman Islands\nPuff on the loud 'til my whole gang was silent\nMy change piling, so fly I could change pilots\nCampaign whiling, my brain remain clouded\nMy mind storm, when it's time to perform\nTo be honest if I clicked it, probably porn\nYour raps bore me, I couldn't have fathered your style\nJust ask Maury, take the glory\nI take the gouda, you know the story, the avenue I grew up\nNiggas thought I trade my old life for a new one, nah\n\n[Hook]\nGuess who's back, as if I'd left\nExcuse me I been busy\nI've been on my grizzly\nHad to put on for my city\nGuess who's back, as if I'd left\nExcuse me I've been my busy\nI've been on my busy\nHad to put on for my city\nGuess who's back\n\n[Verse 2: Fashawn]\nLook up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane\nNah, that's just a grizzly representing this game\nMississippi roots, I descended from slaves\nFar from Lynchburg, but I know where niggas hang\nI just spent enough dollars on my chain\nSo much, I done seen to dollars turn into change, holla\nI want to be royalty to the rap scholars\nMake hits, take hits like Math Hoffa\nFash hotter than a favela in Guatemala\n8 baby mamas sittin' in the sauna\nI wasn't KKK but I understood\nWhy it's hard to hibernate in my hood\nBefore I ever seen an itinerary\nI made 57 visits to the cemetery\nFrom a derelict, to a diety\nEasily I make a atheist believe in me, now\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Fashawn]\nFuck anybody who thought it was over, literally\nOnly thing I left was my mark on the culture\nNiggas fear me, clearly they are not on my level\nI'm a prophet, a rebel, obviously ghetto\nCockin' my metal, autograph signer\nWhen I stop at Valero, had a 12 year old kid tell me I was his hero\nBut instead of a cape, I wear a cap\nWho's to say I alter my faith, that ain't a fact\nEven before adolescence, Fash was destined\nCraft perfected from a dirty pad I sketched in\nFrom lad to legend, I made it to London\nImagine if I had stayed in the dungeon, nigga\nI would have never signed to Esco, never rhymed with Rakim\nTell me, how could I ever let go huh?\nYour fantasy ain't fuckin' with my facts\nSomebody tell these bustas out the back\nShawn, stacks\nI'm back\n\n[Outro: (Fashawn)]\nExcuse me I've been busy\nI've been on my grizzle\nHad to put on for my city, but\n(Somebody tell 'em that I'm back, nigga)\nExcuse me I've been busy\nI've been on my grizzle\nHad to put on for my city, but", "title": "Guess Who\u2019s Back"}]}
