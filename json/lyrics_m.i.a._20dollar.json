War!\nTalking about you's such a bore\nI'd rather talk about moi\nLike do you know the cost of AK's up in Africa?\n20 dollars ain't shit to you\nBut that's how much they are\nSo they're gonna use the shit just to get far\nIs gold diamonds helping ya?\nDon't you like my ban-dan-na? (bandana)\nMy stains hang low, on my shirt's like \"Ay-ya-ya!\"\nGot monkey brains and banana\nI'll hit you with my antenna\nI put soap in my eye\nMake it red so I look rawr-rawr-rawr!\nSo I woke up with my Holy Quran\nAnd found out I like Cadillac\nSo we're shootin' until the song is up\nLittle boys are acting up\nAnd baby mothers are going crazy\nAnd the leaders all around cracking up\nWe goat-rich, we fry\nPrice of livin' in a shanty town just seems very high\nBut we still like T.I\nBut we still look fly\nDancin' as we're shootin' up\nAnd lootin' just to get by (Huh?)\n\n[Hook]\nWith your feet on the air\nYour head on the ground\nTry this trick and spin it - yeah!\nYour head'll collapse, when there's nothin' in it\nAnd you'll ask yourself\nWhere is my mind?\nWhere is my mind?\nWhere is my mind?\n(Huh?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWar! War! War!\nWho made me like this!\nWas it me and God in co-production?\nMy Devil's on speed-dial\nEvery time I take the wrong direction\nAll I want is one thing and that is what you got\nSometimes I go and lose my mind, then I feel numb\nThere's 24 hours in a day\nI used to spilt it 8, 8, 8\n8 - work! 8 - sleep!\nAnd 8 for play!\nNow I give it all it takes\nNow people on the Internet\nA new life for the intellect\nPeople judge me so hard cause I don't floss my titties out\nI was born out of dirt like I'm porn in a skirt\nI was a little girl who made good, well au revoir, adieu\nI put people on the map that never seen a map\nI've showed 'em something they've never seen\nAnd hope they make it back!\n\n[Hook]\nWith your feet on the air\nYour head on the ground\nTry this trick and spin it - yeah!\nYour head'll collapse, when there's nothin' in it\nAnd you'll ask yourself\nWhere is my mind?\nWhere is my mind?\nWhere is my mind?\n(Huh?)\nWith your feet on the air\nYour head on the ground\nTry this trick and spin it - yeah!\nYour head'll collapse, when there's nothin' in it\nAnd you'll ask yourself\nWhere is my mind?", "year": "2007-08-08", "album": "Kala", "title": "20 Dollar"}], "artist": "M.I.A."}
