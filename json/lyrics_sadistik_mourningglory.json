Talk to them\nI lost my innocence, drifted into the distance\nWent from different to indifferent, get sickened by this existence\nMourning Glory\u2026\n\nI feel strangled by the chain that my father used to wear\nIt dangles by my heart, it was the cross that he would bear\nEvery time I think of him, I always go to reach for it\n\u2018Cause it reminds me of the sacred bond that we would share\nBefore the costs I'd inherit, the talks that I'd cherish\nThe loss of a parent made the loss more apparent\nI'm lost in apparent paradox, I can't escape or see\nBetween faith and grief, pain and ease, they made me pray and\nPlace my knees on cinder blocks, break my teeth, and lick the scars\nMake me eat this bitter heart \u2019til the taste gets sweet\nI don't chase my drinks these days\nI hate to sound clich\u00e9, but it's clich\u00e9 to say I hate to sound clich\u00e9\nI may be breaking out these chains today\nI'm finally free, amiss in this abyss, I guess I'm spiralling\nIt's standard stuff, flashing floods, that's my blood you're siphoning\nA side of me's beside itself for anchoring in Hell\nBut I can't see the light I need to save me from myself\nIt's Mourning Glory\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got these bars in my head like I'm Phineas Gage\nThis gauge is on empty so give me some space\nSpaced out from the memories I didn't erase\nRays pound all around me, kissing my face\nFace down, down on my luck, lust for the crown\nCrown in my cup, coupled amounts, mountains erupt\nRuptures I count, count-downs downtrodden\nTrot around downtowns 'til I drown in a bottle, like\nAnd now I'm reading Walden\nWalled-in like I'm sleeping in a coffin\nCoughin' while I'm breathing in the toxins\nTalk sins when I'm needing to absolve them\nThemselves, set sail, sail set\nHellbent, inhale, tell sins\nSend tales of the tailspins\nTip scales, scale-skinned when the trail ends\n\n[Hook]\nShe called me blue flower, more like Morning Glory\nMy port is storming every time she tries to ford it for me\nThey\u2019re always warring on the inside\nThere\u2019s Morning Glory on the inside\n\n[Bridge: Zoe Wick]\nCan\u2019t hurry the morning light\nI tried with all my might\nI\u2019m hanging upside-down\nFacing to the ground\n\u2019Til I bring back the fire\n\n[Hook]", "album": "Salo Sessions"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
