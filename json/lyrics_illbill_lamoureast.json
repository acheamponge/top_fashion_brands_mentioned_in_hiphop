Most my clique will shoot you\n(BLAM BLAM!) Without beads or a bandana\nBullets will make your face blurry like a bad camera\nPeace to Queens nigga, home of that fly shit\nCop killer central, you die quick, what up though?\n\n(Hook)\nLatin Quarter to L\u2019Amour East, we all beasts\nFrom across seas to cross Queens, we all creeps\nCBGB's to L\u2019Amour east, we all beasts\nSmoke PCP, kids got stabbed over graffiti beef\n\n[Verse 2: Q-Unique]\nI took the 6 train to the Bronx for infinity lessons\nWith the rise of the crack rock had the vicinity stressing\nMy Zulu medallion over whatever we was wearing\nIn the late 80\u2019s, we wasn\u2019t born wild, we was made crazy\nThat movie 'Beat Street' was so misleading\n\u2018Cause some of the breakers I knew were stick up kids\nThat leave you cold and bleeding\nIt wasn\u2019t a happier time, New York was a fucking mess\nLittle yellow envelope stuffed with skunk and cess\nThen I\u2019m in the back of the B-Train with a four finger ring\nAnd a gold rope, didn\u2019t look like a rapper\nI looked like somebody that sold dope\nAnd maybe I did, cause back home was no hope\nBut maybe because Rakim said he was no joke\nAnd I wanted to be just like the God\nExcelling my skill level, plus life was hard\nDog it was more realer back then, you would either deal or rap\nThe industry snatched from Brooklyn, I steal it back\n\n[Hook] x 2\n\n[Verse 3: ILL Bill]\nDouble L-Train Canarsie, fit tags, drippy markers\nAlbee Square, colosseum, fifty deep in Kings Plaza\nFlat leavers, crack slingers, cap peelers, rap singers\nBlasted Desert Eagles, turning tracks forever ether\nWhile the war planes scatter nukes, cross-played splatter goons\nSauteed magic shrooms, more strange antics soon\nBlasting \"Paid In Full,\" Dog Day Afternoon\nHad to pay my dues, fought James after school\nI snuffed John Hayes in front of Captain Video\nNext to the Arch Diner, Joey Haskell was with me too\nThat was before the gunplay and Dapper Dan jackets\nBootleg Timberland leathers and automatic ratchets\nBefore Artie Artelino blew his face off\nPlaying Russian Roulette after he vacuumed up a 8-ball\nFrom childhood to manhood in Kings County\nFrom my hood to yours, we represent it proudly\nRepresent New York, represent Rowdy\nRepresent my whole crew, represent Howie\n\n(Hook)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3c85efb9b9e6e7efc21e7b0199174306.800x800x1.jpg", "album": "The Grimy Awards", "year": "2013-02-26"}]}
