The industrial prison complex\nFor niggas in the projects with they eyes shut\nThat still walk around blind to the conquest\nThat haven\u2019t really realized what\u2019s the time yet\nNo due process, the price is no object\nWhen sentences match the crime, they do not yet\nIt\u2019s been a war on the heavily melanated\nFor your own security, you better be educated, listen\n\n[Outro]\nAnd if you can\u2019t see what\u2019s happenin\u2019, you just can\u2019t see"}], "artist": "Black Thought"}
