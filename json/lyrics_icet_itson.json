Ha! That's a joke!\nYou motherfuckers are still unknown and broke\nAnd I'm stankin' rich\nMy fuckin maid lives better than you, bitch\nSo shut your trap\nWhen it comes to this level of game, you don't know jacks\nCIA, FBI, IRS\nTry to flip us out for sweat\nBut they'll never sweat you son\nCause you're broke and you're dumb and you're no threat to no one\nThem fools don't play\nI gotta deal with those motherfuckers every day\nThey'd love to get me behind bars\nThey hawk a nigga like I'm Carlos Escobar\nBut in a way I am\nBeen puttin dope on the street for years and don't give a damn\nSo I'm thinkin about them, friend\nThe real motherfuckin gangstas wanna see me end\nIt's gonna end up in a bloodbath, no doubt\nThat's the only way I'm going out, it's on\n\n[Hook: Ice-T]\nIt's on\nIt's on motherfucker and you can't turn the shit off\nCatch you in the streets and your ass'll get tossed\nBang!
