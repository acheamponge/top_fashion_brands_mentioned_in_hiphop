Take it back to the essence of this shit man\nLet motherfuckers see what you can REALLY do\n\n[K-Rino]\nI'll give you one clue to guess what my rap gun do\nLike kung-fu, I got a steel pallet I practice runnin my tongue through\nNinety extra inches my lung grew, I stun you\nAnd when I'm done a paraplegic'll outrun you\nYou want head trauma, real soon I'ma promise I'ma\nDrop seeds that blow up like the the Unabomber's momma\nY'all know what happens when a rapper starts yappin\nI'll be bionic orangutan hand back stabbin\nI break light speed surge and illustrate verbs\nHis career was so short his bio was eight words\nSee I'm admittin the sentence was well written\nExcept THIS motherfucker should have never started spittin!\nI'm too triflin to let him life again\nI'm stiflin pain permanently by feeding you nitrogen Vicodin\nSee some of the worst speakers that I know\nCould vegetablise your flow like pico de gallo\nBoy you got a lot of balls, playin with a dude\nThat can telekinetically extract bricks out of walls\nIf you come in my zone dissin my curriculum\nI chew your ass out like the flavor in a stick of gum\n\n[Skarlit Rose]\nThe linguistic league bitches, cutthroat, smeared lipstick\nWrists slit and I suggest you keep the {\u200b?}\u200b dissin before\nYou wake up in a tub to only find your ogans missin\nMake sure to leave your tongue, with hopes you continue spittin\nDickridin, label providin, your fraudulent image\nYou the type of silly hoe to have no sense to begin with\nListen hooker emcees, on a mission of death, last breath\nYour final rest, baby who got next?\nI pop your lungs from your chest cavity\nYou consider your amateur blow to be challenging well then battle me!\nI'll be waiting six feet, beneath the sheets of your thesaurus\nDeep defeat, crack your teeth, no AutoTune on my chorus\nDistorted your image, while drownin all your hopes and wishes\nRevenge is served cold on a set of dirty dishes\nSnitches, yeah, haven't you heard?\nI'll put my barrel in your mouth and show you what a women's worth\n\n[Canibus]\nThis is the definitive guide, on beats and rhymes\nOn how to get a black eye fuckin with those black guys\nYou better listen to what I'm sayin and teach yourself\nOr I'll give you a belt and watch you beat yourself\nTold you don't make a sound if you do they will put you down\nThen all I'ma say is look at you now\nHip-Hop was not based off risk on a primal level\nWe rhymin with you, not rhymin at you\nYou better understand this shit or get talked to in Arabic\nBanana clip, you don't wanna talk to Canibus\nYou talk about bars, my upper torso crawl up the wall\nIn your house through your window boy\nBurglar bars get ripped off, bite off your arm\nLeave +Jigsaw+ scars, that's just a doll\nThis is Thunderdome hall, decoded like Sean\nThe laser beam scan the apartment, it's gone\nMetaphorical wizard, the Oracle visit every four minutes\nUntil I finish, you bring me more Guiness\nI'm like Devin the Dude, and Mexican food\nWith some Mexican dude and some gunslingers too\nCome through, call the airstrike on your hood\nEvacuate every bitch that make love so good\nSo what you wan' do? E'rybody chillin, we cool\nDon't have to rip the face off no fool\nThat ain't \"Lyrical Law\" that's a lyrical rule\nI ain't did this before, I don't wanna be cruel\nI just wanna be loved, but the world wants blood\nSo we barricade the doors and wait for the noise\nNature boy, my name is deployed, the cave is destroyed\nIf you mention his name, he gets annoyed\nCause boys should not play with psychotic toys\nA boy should not talk with a psychotic voice\nStand before me, don't plead no case\nCause you passed \"Lyrical Law\", you already great\nSo take your place next to any emcee that's great\nIn the Most High's name we pray\n\"Lyrical Law\""}]}
