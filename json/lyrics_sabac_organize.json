That's why the military so powerful\nBut I'ma get my army together like Colin Powell do\nIdentify causes because it's essential\nStop complaining about what's right and let the fighting continue\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe whole school system sucks, it ain't halfway decent\nDropout rates increasing 'cause the way they be teaching\nThe streets been teaching us lessons for years\nBut we became more concerned, we're just impressing our peers\nI'm testing you here, to see, if you wanna be part\nOf this method to use our streets smart and take over these retards\nWe start first, knowing how the system works\nEducate ourselves and stay out of the prisons and church\nWe work to be mentally and physically strong and healthy\nRealize there's nothing wrong with being wealthy\nNow tell me you don't wanna be rich, come on, dog\nWell, if you wanna be rich then stop being a bitch and wake up\nYou fake fuck, take off your mask and make-up\nThe stakes up, and keep finding new ways to stay up\nFuck my temper, just remember what I told you:\nControl your enemy, don't let your enemy control you!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nPsycho+Logical, Uncle Howie, organize\nNecro, Non Phixion, organize\nAll my peoples in the place let's, organize\nOrganize means freedom, hear what I'm speaking", "album": "Sabacolypse: A Change Gon\u2019 Come"}], "artist": "Sabac"}
