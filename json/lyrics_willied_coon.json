That's a lie. The reason why they support the coon is because they can control the coon. Now, some people gonna have a problem with me callin' these coons out. First thing they gonna say is \"crabsinthebucket, crabsinthebucket\"\u2026 Let me tell you something: this ain't got nothin' to do with me trying to hold another black person back. I love to see black people gettin' it, you understand what I'm saying?\n\nBut if your criticism of the black community outweigh your contribution to the black community, and you black, you a mothafuckin' coon!\n\nIf every time the police shoot somebody black, and you take the police side, you are a coon!\n\nIf you fixed your mouth to say that we ended racism and discrimination in America, like this old coon-ass nigga, David Clarke, who call himself a Sheriff in Milwaukee, you are a coon!\n\nIf you are of any ethnicity other than white, and you support Donald Trump, yes, you are a coon!\n\nIf you out here rattin' on the next man 'cause he husslin', and y'all doin' the same thing, you're not just a coon, you a mothafuckin' rat-coon!\n\nNow let me get back to this crossdressin'-ass nigga Charles Barkley\u2014 Look here, nigga, you love to talk about how you'll slap somebody. I wish you would put your mothafuckin' hands on me\u2026I'd body your fat ass! Real talk. This nigga got a real self-hate issue. Fuck Charles Barkley, and the ground he walk on! If you fuckin' with Charles Barkley, fuck you too! Yeah, I said it\u2026It's Willie D. H-town. Fifth Ward.
