I ain't dying for no president\nSending kids to die when we didn't even elect the bitch\n\n[Hook] {x2}\n\n[Verse 3]\nListen I'm in no position to judge a young stud\nTryn'a use the military to come the fuck up\nCos self preservation is the first law of nature\nPlay your cards smart, remember what the fucks up\nIt's really no different from crack pedaling when it\nComes to dying and killing for a dream you were given\nLast thing in your mind is how you seen by the system\nN' be willing to go to those extremes for your vision\nShit I'm no smarter, I'm fucking retarded\nI just know enough to not eat directly where the dog shits\nIf Uncle Sam wants to threaten my health\nTell him he have to come and get me himself\n...the motherfucker\n\n[Hook] {x2}", "year": null, "album": "The Undisputed Truth"}], "artist": "Brother Ali"}
