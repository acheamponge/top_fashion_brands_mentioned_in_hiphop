try an' do this\nIt's Josh Sallee\nI did\nI did, huh\nI gave them a minute\nThat's probably too many\nFor y'all that don't feel me\nJust fall back like poppin' a wheelie\nThrough [?]\nBut nah not from Philly\nI got heat like chillin'\nI'm not no one, really\nJust thought I should kill this, then did that\nI push on that pressure, impressive, it [?] should\nOpt for the audience [?] over obvious don't\nLike me and K.A.A.N., we should probably be on\nWhat's taking so long, they playing your songs, I hate everyone\nWhy'd I go do this again, just to confuse up my brain\nLike summer moving the spring\nSome can't just do it, some can't\nYea, never too soon to be great, but better be sooner than later\nGot [?] but never you\nSo what's the wait up\nNeed a break, I work my ass off man, I'm adamant\nIt's like bad breath\nI'll outsmart them, I'm 'bout my biz, I doubt you is\nYou full of it, we left watching like that house of kids\nMy references miss like that gown and kiss\nStern on being private with parts of life like Howard did\nOver tower them, block 'em out, [?] them\nWhen I'm out, I get uncomfortable like laying down on bricks\nThey counterfeit, faker than your body shapes, drop them grapes\nCall me king, and after that you can call me great\nOld me gone away, new me always late, so how I'm s'posed to operate if both them walk away\nLike, call in sick today, let's make history, go a different way\nSouls can liberate, hold it in a way, blow it in a blaze\nSo what's wrong if I don't do shit today\nI'ma do me, that's over anything\nRun from my problems\n[?] show it to my boss so there's no coincidence\n\n[Verse 2: K.A.A.N.]\nI will terrify you with a sicker trance, and then paint a canvas with a can of blood\nI'm in a canopy, I got a couple victims\nI'll deprive 'em all, I need no assistance\nAnd your nervous pimpin', I will start dissecting\nWhen I grab a weapon, it's a fuckin wrap\nAnd when I hit the lights so that the room was black\nI got a razor blade, I got a few knives\nI got a broomstick for when I sodomize\nI'm in a bad space, I mean mentally\nAnd the only thing a motherfucker really wanna do is cut your throat and watch you leak\nIf I do speak, then I will degrade ya\nI'm a man of hatred, but I truly love it\nAnd I'm off my meds 'cus I don't need a pill\nI wanna rape and pillage, I'm a fuckin' monster\nWhen I pick the victim and I torture them, but then your face is pale, it's new porcelain\nSo call me Jack the Ripper, young savage nigga\nAnd I'm tearing tendons, but I take my time\nI got a temperament with no rational\nI got an attitude, I wanna see violence\nShoot the school campus like it's Columbine\nWe'll set a memorabilia for the commissary\nSo we in the prison, in the common room\nAnd I'ma tell the story of a mass-murderer\nAnd the way I move like 2 cat burglars, but the saddest part is that I got the verdict\nI'll be in this motherfucker for the rest of my life\nI got no bail and no damn hope\nI'm chillin' in my cell, they won't give parole\nThe habitual killer, he wanna slice them all\nThey try to medicate me with some Propofol\nBut I'm still wylin' and that's protocol\nAnd I'm on a mission, 'cus I wanna recall\nBut if I break it down, then I can make ya vomit\nMove in silence, should be placed inside asylums\n[?] Sodom and Gomorrah\nTried to warn ya, you're a goner\nI am gonna elevate, hesitatin', not me\nTry to describe 'em but I can never depict 'em\nWhen I mutilate them I take two pics\nOne Polaroid and one for my mind\nBut don't worry 'bout me nigga, shit I'm fine\nYou could take a listen to my deposition\nMurder a nigga, the body in Florida\nYeah, he was screaming but I am dismissing it\nGet the fuck out of the car\nAnd I am hearing the sound what had came from the trunk\nAnd I go to the back and I open it, popping him right in the mouth\nAnd I'm grabbing the rope and I'm tying him up\nAnd I'm still trying to think so just shut the fuck up\n'Cus it's already done and I'm feeling offended, you offering funds\nSo why you insult my integrity, you had no leverage\nHurt everybody, yeah that's what the message is\nThought I was thinking while taking some Mescaline\nMinding my business, I keep to myself\nSuffocate people you say are the best\nI'm no one to test, especially when I am stressed\nMy head is a mess\nI'm having a vision of death, the duty is mine\nMyself I oblige, I'm in full effect\nMy flow homicide, when I am correct\nYes I'll see you later, as I disintegrate ya\nDismember like a butcher, now you about to meet your maker\nChop your flesh and then I toss it on a piece of parchment paper\nSix to two, that's what I do\nA dirty dozen from the baker\nBake a cake and then make you eat it, put it in your face like anime\nAnimate it like anime, \u00f3rale, what the hell he say\nVamanos, we should probably leave\nBodies leaking a liter, got blood on your Mamacita and the clothes that she wore\nI hit the stairs as people stare, there's cartilage in your hair\nAs collagen and bodily fluids coagulate boy\nAnd of course I caught me a corpse in a corridor out in Corpus\nChristie\nAccording to court order correspondence and documents\nLooking for the motherfucking exit shit, it's my time to leave\nI gotta disappear, I said I don't adhere but I wanna make it clear\nI got no fear nor reservations\nMy lonely soul is in a different world and I'm a distant poet with a prophecy\nAnd my proper form is like a masterpiece with no appreciation 'till I'm deceased\nSpot you, now I gotcha, lure you into my trap\nEnter the function, ain't no fuss and I'll be quick to attack\nTaxing that ass, I'd take a sword and slice it right down your back\nHattori Hanz\u014d with a combo, I crack a couple of vertebrae\nVerifying my strength with the scent of death in the air, I appear and punch a medulla oblongata for wisdom\nMake an incision but it's empty, nigga what a surprise\nI know they wanna see me fall, quick to embrace my demise\nI'm going on a killing spree, I got blood lust in my eyes\nBut don't you step into my cellar, it would leave you surprised\nI know you don't want anymore for when I step through the door\nI've been strangulating the victim on my hardware floor\nChoke him with force until I take the life up out of the boy\nWith no remorse I mortify ya, this holy water will sanctify ya Sending liars into the fire to burn eternally\nBut that's if I despise ya, advise that you wait your turn\nBut if Knowledge was crucified, I would resurrect and return on the Sabbath and started stabbing with static\nHave you collapsing\nBoy"}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
