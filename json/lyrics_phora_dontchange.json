(Nah)\nYou couldn't walk in my shoes if we switched places\nTurn your back for a second, they switch faces\nLook, I peak things, then I fall back\nUsed to want to be around them, now I don't call back\nNow I'm in a Benz Maybach and it's all black\nI learned these niggas say they got your back, but it's all cap, yeah\nThese people switchin' on me quick these days\nSo I ain't takin' anybody's shit these days\nSee I don't know who to trust, who gon' flip these days?\nSometimes, I just wanna forget these days, damn\nSo I respect when you answer me when I call you\nThis life is lonely and people don't always fall through\nI lost touch with myself, but I guess we all do\nJust come through when you need somebody to talk to, I got you\nJust forgive me for all these trust issues\nYou stayed down through it all and thats why I fuck wit' you\nI know I told you I'm leaving, I said I'm done with you\nTruthfully, I just think that I might be in love with you\nAnd I'm scared that somebody might take my place\nSettle for somebody who's hardly ever away\nI know the heart is fragile, theres only so much it takes\nWhile we going through these cycles and the waves\nAll I ask is don't change on me, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't change on me\nThrough the pressure and the pain, all the money and the fame\nAll I ask is don't change on me, yeah\nDon't change\nBaby I ain't playing games, you can have my last name\nAll I ask is don't change on me\nDon't change on me\nThrough the pressure and the pain, all the money and the fame\nAll I ask is don't change on me, yeah\nDon't change\nBaby I ain't playing games, you can have my last name\nAll I ask is don't change on me", "year": "2019-03-07"}]}
