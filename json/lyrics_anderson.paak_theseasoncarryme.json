(\"Momma, carry me?\")\nTo the early morn (\"Momma, can you carry me?\")\nTo the early morning (\"Momma, can you carry me?\")\n\n[Verse 1]\nHey, hey, hey, gather round, hustlers, that's if ya still livin'\nAnd get on down before the judge give the sentence\nA few more rounds before the feds come and get you\nIs you gonna smile when your date gets issued?\nYou know them feds taking pictures\nYour mom\u2019s in prison, your father need a new kidney\nYou family\u2019s splitting, rivalries between siblings\nIf cash ain\u2019t king it's damn sure the incentive\nAnd good riddance\n\n[Interlude]\n\"Is the element of danger an important factor for the members of your peer group?\"\n\"Yes, you might say that. Why don\u2019t you give it a try and find out for yourself?\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nBout the year Drizzy and Cole dropped\nBefore K.Dot had it locked\nI was sleeping on the floor, newborn baby boy\nTryna get my money pot so wifey wouldn\u2019t get deported\nCursing the heavens, falling out of orbit\nTryna roll this seven, tryna up my portion\nWhat about your goals? What about your leverage?\nSo they don\u2019t force you into some hole\nWhat\u2019s the meaning of my fortune reading?\nWhen I crack the cookie, all it said was \u201ckeep dreaming\u201d\nWhen I look at my tree, I see leaves missing\nGenerations of harsh living and addiction\nI came to visit during the seven-year stint\nBut they wouldn\u2019t let me in because my license suspended\nNow I\u2019m scraping the pennies just to kiss you on your cheek\nIt\u2019s gonna be a couple weeks before I get it\nI know you miss me\n\n[Hook]\nSix years old, I tried my first pair of Jordans on\n(Momma can you carry me?)\nIt was late in the fall\nI caught a glimpse of my first love, my God\n(Momma can you carry me?)\nKnees hit the floor, screams to the Lord\nWhy they had to take my ma? (Momma can you carry me?)\nTo the early morn (Momma can you carry me?)\nTo the early morning (Momma can you carry me?)\n\n[Break]\n(Momma can you carry me?)\n(Momma can you carry me?)\n(Momma can you carry me?)\n(Momma can you carry me?)\n\n[Bridge]\nYeah, oh, oh, oh\nAnd one of these is my rise\nOne of these is my downfall\nAnd I\u2019m the one to make it right\nI wanna make it right, momma\nAnd one of these is my rise\nOne of these is my downfall\nAnd I\u2019m the one to make it right\nI wanna make it right, momma\nI wanna make it right\n\n[Outro]\n(Momma can you carry me?)\nTo the early morning\n(Momma can you carry me?)\nTo the early morning\n(Momma can you carry me?)\nOh lord\n(Momma can you carry me?)\n(Momma can you carry me?)\n(Momma can you carry me?)\n(Momma can you carry me?)\n(Momma can you carry me?)\n\n[Outro: Sample: Psychologist + Leroy the Masochist]\nI see here they call you a masochist\nI like pain\nCan you be specific?
