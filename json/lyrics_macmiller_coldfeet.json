Hey\n\n[Verse 1: Mac Miller]\nThey always want that fun shit when you tryna spit a little somethin' real\nThey start runnin', turnin' chicken like a nugget meal\nHow the fuck I feel? Kinda like a hundred mill\nSpun the wheel, bought a vowel, I don't owe you nothin' still\nFuck a deal, I can do it with my own team\nWon before Sheen, hear how all these hoes scream\nWhen I was 14, sippin' on my OE\nTryna marry money but that bitch kept gettin' cold feet\nMusic loud, hear it bangin' through the whole street\nBeat gettin' shit on, toilet bowl seat\nNo sleep, just work\nGot a couple horny girls in a see-through shirt\nSo believe my hype, muthafuckas can't read nor write\nStill they talkin' shit man, I've seen your type\nGot problems, can't sleep at night\nCause your girl want to come around freak all night\nI'm a sex drill when I'm rollin' off them x pills\nFive bikes, ten wheels, girl I'll leave your legs still\nSay I don't do drugs, just weed\nWell I'mma do drugs and speed down the street\nDo doughnuts, your flow sucks, you so butt\nYour girl's gettin' throat fucked, I get high, I go up\nWhy you sayin' that he's a trend?\nThen come to all those shows just to meet your friends?\nSo much coke sniffed, fuckin' hoes with bloody noses\nJust a couple doses, fuck the roses\nClass time, better take good notes\nYou bitches couldn't touch me with a Facebook poke\nBitch!", "year": "2011-08-26", "album": "I Love Life, Thank You", "title": "Cold Feet"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
