Stone]\nJust up and leave, man whats up with that\nIf I exposed you baby, I take that back\nMy homie said that you just switched your labels\nLast time we kissed I tasted a different flavor\nI'm on that red now, it ain't the same\nBut I just gotta try to ease the pain\nI've seen it all: yellow, blue and green\nI ain't a fiend, I just gotta lean\nWhen I shoot my videos I ain't gotta show it (nuh-uh)\nYou know I'm fuckin' with the Po' up Poet\nIf I said I didn't miss ya' I'd be a liar\nThey say it's 32 a pint' but to me you're priceless\n\n[Chorus]", "year": null}]}
