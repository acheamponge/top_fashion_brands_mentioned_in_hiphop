We gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nHuh? We gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nDo you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright\n\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nUh, and when I wake up\nI recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut\nBut homicide be looking at you from the face down\nWhat MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?\nSchemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life\nPainkillers only put me in the twilight\nWhere pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight\nNow tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows\nTwenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me\nReaping everything I sow, so my karma come in heaven\nNo preliminary hearings on my record\nI'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh\nTell the world I know it's too late\nBoys and girls, I think I gone cray\nDrown inside my vices all day\nWon't you please believe when I say\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nWouldn't you know\nWe been hurt, been down before\nNigga, when our pride was low\nLookin' at the world like, \"Where do we go?\"\nNigga, and we hate po-po\nWanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'\nNigga, I'm at the preacher's door\nMy knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow\nBut we gon' be alright\n\n[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nWe gon' be alright\nDo you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nHuh? We gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nDo you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nWhat you want you, a house\u2060? You, a car?\n40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?\nAnything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog\nMotherfucker, you can live at the mall\nI can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal\nI don't think about it, I deposit every other zero\nThinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal\nDigging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you\nEvery day my logic get another dollar just to keep you\nIn the presence of your chico... Ah!\nI don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel\nIf I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you\nPat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all\nBick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all\nI rap, I black on track so rest assured\nMy rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nWouldn't you know\nWe been hurt, been down before\nNigga, when our pride was low\nLookin' at the world like, \"Where do we go?\"\nNigga, and we hate po-po\nWanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'\nNigga, I'm at the preacher's door\nMy knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow\nBut we gon' be alright\n\n[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nWe gon' be alright\nDo you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nHuh? We gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nDo you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright\n\n[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Thundercat]\nI keep my head up high\nI cross my heart and hope to die\nLovin' me is complicated\nToo afraid of a lot of changes\nI'm alright, and you're a favorite\nDark nights in my prayers\n\n[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]\nI remembered you was conflicted\nMisusing your influence, sometimes I did the same\nAbusing my power, full of resentment\nResentment that turned into a deep depression\nFound myself screamin' in the hotel room\nI didn't wanna self-destruct\nThe evils of Lucy was all around me\nSo I went runnin' for answers"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
