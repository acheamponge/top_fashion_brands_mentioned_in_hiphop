(What?)\nI happen to think that you are\nIn fact, I'm convinced that you're an angel\nThat somehow fell from the sky\nYou fly, but I don't get your angle\nNow we can sit here and pretend\nLike the feelings you have are non-existent\nBut it's so obvious you're dying inside to be my princess\nLook at you now, you smilin'\nBut earlier you was whilin'\nLike \"I wouldn't fuck with that dude\nIf we was stuck on a deserted island\"\n(Oh, that's how you feel?)\n\n[Chorus: Kesha & (Travie McCoy)]\nI love the crazy things you do\n'Cause tonight's the night for me to play the fool\nAnd the mood is right, plus you're so polite\n(But you know that I really want you\nGirl, you know that I really want you)\nI really, really, really, really want you bad\nYour lips got a smile that ain't ever sad\nYou bad bad boy, I ain't ever mad at you\n(But you know that I really want you\nGirl, you know that I really want you)\nAt you, boy\n\n[Bridge: Kesha]\nI love the crazy things you do\nDo something oh so naughty, cool\nTonight, I'm gonna play the fool\nSo what? I wanna get with you\n\n[Chorus: Kesha & (Travie McCoy)]\nI love the crazy things you do\n'Cause tonight's the night for me to play the fool\nAnd the mood is right, plus you're so polite\n(But you know that I really want you\nGirl, you know that I really want you)\nI really, really, really, really want you bad\nYour lips got a smile that ain't ever sad\nYou bad bad boy, I ain't ever mad at you\n(But you know that I really want you\nGirl, you know that I really want you)\nI ain't ever mad at you, boy"}], "artist": "Travie McCoy"}
