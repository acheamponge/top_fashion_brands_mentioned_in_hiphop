I'm about these antidotes\nPainkillers, Prozac, muscle relaxers, trust me, my back hurts\nInsane in the membrane, nigga, my brain might be on backwards\nI'mma get back to work, kill 'em and put 'em in a cardboard box\nBrains in a basket\nRumor has it I lock like a mastiff and I got enough zip-lock plastic\nGive a nigga that hip hop casket, who can put 'em in a zip-lock fastest?\nMe! That's who, shit get thick like I'm molasses\nI'mma get 'em and put 'em in somethin' sinister\nDennis, you motherfuckin' menace, I'm 'bout to finish 'em\nWhen does a cannibal, mannibal, animal finish up? I don't know\n\n[Hook] (x2)\nI just hate the way things are, I fuckin' hate the music now\nRappers needs to get smacked, show 'em they ain't useful now\nThey one-hitter quitters, skinny jean niggas\nR&B singers, I'm a krocadil meat eater\n\n[Verse 2]\nRip 'em up, rip 'em up, rip 'em up, rip 'em up\nCut 'em up, cut 'em up, cut 'em up, cut 'em up\nI be givin' the liver disease, killin' 'em\nTurnin' they insides to raw hide, grillin' 'em\nThis is what happened, I wrapped him up in some plastic\nAnd took 'em home for the acid bath, it was so funny, I have to laugh\nThese niggas ain't eatin' meat, I beat 'em then leave\nTakin' 'em out for cheap, I'mma put that body up\nBlood stains in the motel lobby\nI'mma probably cut Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday\nI'm an all-day nut, Friday, Saturday and Fools' Day\nI'mma put the 9 milli to your toupee\nClock 'em out, Friday is a new day\nCut 'em out, spread the body over two states\nTwo labels, nigga, two chains\nButcher knife in a black backpack\nIn a black Cadillac, make 'em take a catnap\nI get raw like Eddie Murph, nigga, have your family hurt, nigga\nI put family first, nigga, fuck around and make it worse, nigga\n(Push him out the door) Put him in a hearse, nigga\nI'mma get 'em and put 'em in somethin' sinister\nDennis, you motherfuckin' menace, I'm 'bout to finish 'em\nWhen does a cannibal, mannibal, animal finish up? I don't know\n\n[Hook] (x2)\n\nEat 'em, eat 'em, eat the guts up (x12)\nEat 'em (x14)\nEat the guts up!\n\n[Hook] (x2)", "year": "2013-01-29", "album": "Mannibalector"}], "artist": "Brotha Lynch Hung"}
