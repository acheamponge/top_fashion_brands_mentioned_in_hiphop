Where the dum-dums at?\nNinety-three million miles away from where the sun's at\nI'm Jimmy nine times, cousin you a dumb rat\nI put you in the back of the ac with Pun mac\nI'm a grown-ass lion, you a young cat\nWet 'em up, better hope the ambulance comes stat\nTake the shotty off the gun rack\nToss his body on the ground like when Charles Bark sonned Shaq\n\nWild motherfucker since birth, get hurt\nWho's first? Got blood thirst, shoot up your hearse\nIt's insane, let me explain the pain\nI came to reign supreme, hammer damage your brain\nHighly flammable, easily slaying you\nI do what I came to do, your hood should be ashamed of you\nBlaq Po, murder motherfuckers up, yo\nWhat the fuck is up? I don't care what they say, you fuckin' suck\nThe black monster go harder\nSpit pure lava, word to the father\nDon't make me show up at your crib with the pump\nI can find out where you live, where you from\nBut you're not a threat, you're puppy-dog harmless\nTail between your legs when I start to bomb shit"}], "artist": "Blaq Poet"}
