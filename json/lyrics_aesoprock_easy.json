Not mine...\nI hug a hammock in the bedlam\nAnd when the potentially lucrative race horse gets deaded\nI'll wake up for a second to help the betters count their blessings\nBut I cannot Cratchet crutch the Ebenezer limbs much longer\nFlaccid flimsy songbirds, classic dizzy wrong turns\nFor the long term got a dragon all achy\nTorn between the lending of a helping five knuckles\nAnd a charter your own escape\nNow it's like, sufferin' succotash, bucko, ducks in the chuckle patch\n10-4 on that, stinger operation, wingman double back\nFuck it, Let him roam the home of the mange ridden emaciated\nSlave pain cave children game\nNot all players heal the same!\n\nLearn it or don't learn shit\nMy radio is on regardless\nI tune out pardons and tune in starlets\nCarbon and pre-David/Goliath live Paleolithic bias\nWho walks on all fours dragging the cadaver of King Midas\nNow it's Thor dwarf war hammers, Elvin bow and arrow aimers\nDocumentation of the rate at which narrow tapers\nHermit crab, honest cat, trying to raise the roof in my own TV room\nAnd still get the security deposit back\nCall Ripley, Skippy\nMotorhead dope fixture on some 'Go to bed, no dinner!\nHold your head, cold winter!'\nEase up out of the ghastly, desert dozer cliques stranded on cloud 8\nProud of their pogo sticks, I stay left\nAlong came a spider, sprung and alert, I stay def\nHe makes records with his tongue in the dirt\nSuffer the dirty earth crisis with a license to flirt\nBuffer the mighty tighty sequins with a price on the merch\nCovert Mr. Blizzard shoulder, he always acts all pissy\nPlus your friend said I was an asshole when he met me\nNo bad moods aloud when you're in the public eye\nKill it, you are the weakest link, goodbye\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Easy", "album": "Bazooka Tooth", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5a2c7b8825768526d90927046bb22cfe.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2003-09-23"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
