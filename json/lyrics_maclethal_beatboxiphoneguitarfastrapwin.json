You got something so sick\nJust busting through you, nutty cuckoo\nIt's so ugly brutal, how you let the money move you\nFrom being faceless to racist, straight spitting salacious hate fits\nNo better than Honey BooBoo sitting in her runny doo-doo\nBloody voodoo -- the clock strikes midnight\nNow gimme that insight\nHuman beings are so intelligent\nWe gotta be a little bitty better than this right?\nBut nope, we keep on de-evolving\nAs billionaires keep on golfing\nAnd the Mayans said the world was gonna stop\nAs the planet went a POP - but whaddya know? It keeps revolving\nSpeed it up-\nEvery time I turn the television on\nI see another thing reminding me that everything is wrong\nI see news people interviewing 5 year old children\nNot even 30 minutes after witnessing a killing\nI know its cliche, but do you remember the Middle East?\nDo you even care, do you wonder, do you feel at least\nWorried about how our troops are pulling through it?\nDo you ever get to thinking about these bullied students?\nDo you... do you ever consider\nThe homeless man that's sleeping under bridges every December\nIts freezing cold and all he wants is just a sweater or dinner\nBut not a single one of us can seem to ever remember\nToo busy caught up in the media frenzy, when a problem\nChild, gets a gun and goes Gangnam Style\nHe's taking a weapon, slipping the clip in\nKids are dumpin and hitting the asphalt\nI'm thinking half the kids in this country are on bath salts\n\n(Hook)\n\nIlluminati consumer hotties that do pilates\nLotta loot and dollars to do photography\nShoot her body, bada boom ba bada\nAzul, Assata Shakur just shot a cop\nIn Cuba, bounty the beauty's medulla oblongata\nMonumental, menopausal mini-movie fame whores\nAnd that don't really make sense but, either does the race war\nI'm sick and I'm picking a fight, I switch on the brights, I'm slow coasting\nI'm getting your mind so open, just like I'm Joe Rogan\nSome people are just sick people\nEven the word retarded can offend people\nAnd between me and the Westboro Baptist church\nI'm the one paying taxes first!\nI'd rather take a punch from Ving Rhames\nThan learn morals from King James\nSo all I'm saying is, even though I love The Constitution\nThe other day - some things changed", "year": "2012-12-12", "album": "YouTube", "title": "Beatbox + iPhone + Guitar + Fast Rap = Win"}], "artist": "Mac Lethal"}
