Kelly]\nWe ain't gon' leave 'til 4 in the mornin'\nThousand dollar tab, but I can afford it\nOn my 4th drink but I'm not an alcoholic\nShorty say she want me, she way too scrawny\nBy 4 o'clock I might be too horny to go home lonely\nI can't be lonely\nLeft the last club cause the DJ was boring\nCame back, valet parked it and the valet robbed me\nNigga true story, and that was 12:40(am)\nBy 1 o'clock I was back in the wary\nTipsy, Ferrari, this Hennessy got me\nOh baby, I'm so sorry\n\n[Hook: R. Kelly]\nBut if you're drinkin' what I'm drinkin'\nPut your hands up in the sky\nIf you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'\nYou'll say \"what a crazy night!\"\nWay-oh, way-oh\n\n[Verse 2: R. Kelly]\nWe ain't go leave 'til 4, maybe later\nTrack so funky, make you make an ugly face\nRun that back, I mean start that over\nShorty get closer, hot like a toaster\nBody so tight, like she walked off the poster\nKellz caked up, make her call me the baker\nMan, he a hater, she gonna see me later\nHe got good intentions, but not enough paper\nWe left doin' 80, caught a flat up on the Friday\nHeaded back to the highway, think they'll stay at my place\nJust so fucked up, man it's not my day\nI need another shot of that Bacardi\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Rock City]\n(Jamaican gibberish)\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Crazy Night", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5a944a10bb0940f7591a3793da77ca12.550x550x1.jpg"}]}
