That off in my head\nI used to kickflip in my Kostons now rap awesome instead\nThrow a ketchup bottle at you\nThat\u2019s some freaking flying sauces\nAnd go to Mars and show you flying saucers\nMan we gotta off of this\nWe don\u2019t have no parents, all the MSFTS are foster kids\nAnd we don\u2019t have no friends\nCause all you fakies and narcissists\nA group of individuals, we kinda like sausages\nHomie I\u2019m off of this, what I will do is offer this\nIntellect, my extension to enter that\nBuy a Ralph Lauren vintage deck without a sending check\nIn a sec I\u2019m bout to intersect in what you sayin\nSo I could show the whole world what my penmanship\nI ain\u2019t finished yet\nWindows tinted, yeah I like to look at all the women\nGet hot, when the sun is on I\u2019m summer sun in summer\nAutumn, winter, spring\nSummer, autumn, winter, spring\nSome would like to hear me sing\nI\u2019ll buy you diamond rings and store them in my dreams\nAnd we were all a part of one, forgot our teams\nAnd had a phone that never rings\nLove that freakin phone", "image": "https://images.genius.com/409c2730f7d124772542e6daad0459c3.500x500x1.jpg", "album": null, "title": "5"}]}
