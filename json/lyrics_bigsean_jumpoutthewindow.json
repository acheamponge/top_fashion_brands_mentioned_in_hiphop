What's ya reservation?\nYou been trippin', trippin' with no destination\nYou need separation, you need recreation\nY'all been arguing every other day\nYa friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill\nIt's no need to turn this into Kill Bill, look\nFunny we ran into each other while we leaving\nYou walked in with a perm\nAnd now yo' hair look like The Weeknd's\nI know that you been needin' clarity\nDon't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy\nBut you gave too much time to that boy charity, hear me\n\n[Chorus]\nI think I'm ready to jump out the window\nAnd turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though\nWe already wasted too much time\nAnd your time is the only thing I wish was mine\nSo yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window\n\n[Outro]\nLook, I don't mean to sound like the jealous type\nBut you oughta know (oughta know)\nI think me and you should get together sometimes\nOn the low low low\nSometimes I wonder if you even know\nHow much you worth, I gotta know\nSometimes I wonder if you even know\nHow much you worth, I gotta know\nI don't mean to sound like the jealous type\nBut you oughta know (oughta know)\nI think me and you should get together sometimes\nOn the low low low\nSometimes I wonder if you even know\nHow much you worth, I gotta know\nSometimes I wonder if you even know\nHow much you worth I gotta know\nI gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know\nI think I'm ready to jump out the window\nThis one's for you, you, you, you, you, you, you"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
