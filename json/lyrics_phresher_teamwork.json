my niggas, 'cause I know that they ride for me\nJust keep it one hundred, you ain't gotta lie to me\nDon't fuck with no fuck niggas, don't even say hi to me\nI die for my niggas, 'cause I know they'll die for me\nI ride for my niggas, 'cause I know that they ride for me\nJust keep it one hundred, you ain't gotta lie to me\nDon't fuck with no fuck niggas, don't even say hi to me\nI die for my niggas, 'cause I know they'll die for me\nTeamwork, teamwork make the dream work\nTeamwork, teamwork make the dream work\nTeamwork, teamwork make the dream work\nTeamwork, teamwork make the dream work\n\n[Verse 1: PHresher]\nYou wasn't around, I was down on my luck\nNow every day I be countin' it up\nScreaming your name and they proud of you, huh\nThese niggas only be down when you up\nThey say ain't no Khaled but we be the best\nKeep it a buck but you keepin' it less\nMight aim for my chest so I keep me a vest\nI hope you bird niggas sleep in a nest\nFlooded my chain, I feel like New Orleans\nChange my whole family life and record it\nThe way that I ball, my name should be Spalding\nI gotta make sure the money keep calling\nI'm steady shittin' while y'all niggas falling\nCouple of things that I need to sharpen\nCold day in hell and my niggas starvin'\nI sic 'em, they biting, no time for no barking\nGotta feed my ony son, gotta feed my lil daughter\nShe cherish everything that I taught her\nWorth more than anything I ever bought her\nAny and every track I'ma slaughter\nIf I come up short then they come up shorter\nNo time to ball, they don't even bother\nOff with your head if my kids ever bothered, yeah\nI shedded some tears when I wrote this shit\nBe hurting inside, no one notices\nCan't let out my feelings, no notices\nSkrrt skrrt off the lot, ain't no quoting shit\nBut when I'm on it we talkin' the win\nMy pieces hittin' like I got a band\nI know these niggas don't want me to win\nWhen did this hatin' shit become a trend?\n\n[Chorus: PHresher]\nI ride for my niggas, 'cause I know that they ride for me\nJust keep it one hundred, you ain't gotta lie to me\nDon't fuck with no fuck niggas, don't even say hi to me\nI die for my niggas, 'cause I know they'll die for me\nI ride for my niggas, 'cause I know that they ride for me\nJust keep it one hundred, you ain't gotta lie to me\nDon't fuck with no fuck niggas, don't even say hi to me\nI die for my niggas, 'cause I know they'll die for me\nTeamwork, teamwork make the dream work\nTeamwork, teamwork make the dream work\nTeamwork, teamwork make the dream work\nTeamwork, teamwork make the dream work\n\n[Verse 2: Derez De'Shon]\nEver since a nigga made it, couple niggas hatin', but it's all good with me\nThey say that I've been MIA, in and out of the state, but I bring the whole hood with me\nAll of my streamers be loaded, all of my niggas be loaded, woo, huh\nAll of my bitches be goin', they fuck me\nThey fuck the whole crew and they know it\nI stopped taking drugs and started seein' shit differently\nNiggas must didn't think I noticed\nThey smile in my face but talk behind my back\nI be cool and act like I didn't notice shit\nAct like it don't bother me but it be botherin' me, honestly I don't even know why\nYou act like you fuck with me, act like it's love with me, sit right up under me, y'all sus\nThat's a flag on the play, you out of bounds, out of place\nI can tell you mad by your face\n'Posed to be my mans, why you hate?\nSee y'all niggas change by the day\nSo I do my thing out the way\nIt's only a few real ones left\nI don't treat 'em different, love 'em all the say\nTeamwork make the dream work, but you gotta be a team first\nDidn't seem hurt, you ain't put in work, you just wanna rock the team jersey\nWannabe version, nigga if you ain't first, you just tweet on me like you was worth it\nI can't even lie, yeah that shit hurt me, Derez De'Shon\n\n[Chorus: PHresher]\nI ride for my niggas, 'cause I know that they ride for me\nJust keep it one hundred, you ain't gotta lie to me\nDon't fuck with no fuck niggas, don't even say hi to me\nI die for my niggas, 'cause I know they'll die for me\nI ride for my niggas, 'cause I know that they ride for me\nJust keep it one hundred, you ain't gotta lie to me\nDon't fuck with no fuck niggas, don't even say hi to me\nI die for my niggas, 'cause I know they'll die for me\nTeamwork, teamwork make the dream work\nTeamwork, teamwork make the dream work\nTeamwork, teamwork make the dream work\nTeamwork, teamwork make the dream work\n\n[Verse 3: Philthy Rich]\nTeamwork make the dream work, half these rappers never seen work\nBad bitch, new Celine purse, she gon' suck dick 'til her knees hurt\nThey don't want smoke, they don't want pressure\nName a nigga on the West fresher\nBK with my nigga PHresher\nFishscale, you can see the texture\nIf I put money on a nigga head, be the only time a nigga worth somethin'\nSeminary niggas gon' murk somethin' and your baby mama gon' twerk somethin'\nTwenty-sixes on a Benz truck with a bad bitch from Dikeman\nShe Dominican but she light skinned\nMy niggas beat that indictment\nHit Lush just to celebrate, got a thousand ones and a thousand guns\nThem Seminary boys get money\nWhere you from niggas just a thousand bums\nMy Philly bitch got a fat ass, she only bartend on the weekend\nShe mad as fuck at me right now 'cause I was in her best friend DM\nIt's Philthy", "year": "2018-04-08"}]}
