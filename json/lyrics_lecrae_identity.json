Uh, ha, yeah!\nAw yeah, T.R.U.T.H., come on J.R.!\nI'm feelin' it, man\n\n[Verse 1: Lecrae]\nYeah, hair, check!\nShoes, check!\nA brand new fit lookin' cool, check!\nI'm lookin' in the mirror like, \"Ooh, yes!\"\nTo cover for an insecure dude, check!\nBut she won't feel me and they won't like me\nIf I ain't in them Js or them brand new Nikes\nLet's dig deeper inside my psyche\nWhen it's all said and done, even I don't like me\nHe live in the gym and his hair stay faded\nLate model car so they think he made it\nHe's Christian, he gave his life\nBut he still ain't satisfied in the Savior Christ\nStill finds his identity in looks and cars\nIf he only knew that he ain't have to look so hard\nIf he looked in God, it may seem odd\nBut he'd be so satisfied, he can leave it all, yeah\n\n[Hook: J.R. & Lecrae]\nI'm not the shoes I wear\nI'm not the clothes I buy\nI'm not the house I live in\nI'm not the car I drive, no\nI'm not the job I work\nYou, you can't define my worth\nBy nothing on God's green earth\nMy identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ\n\n[Verse 2: Da' T.R.U.T.H.]\nHey, how do I gain success?\nWhy do I say I'm blessed?\nHuh?\nIs it the car that I drive?\nOr the place that I rest?\nOr the way that I dress?\nNow, now\nIs the cause of my pride\nThe stage and the set?\nOr my face in the press?\nNow, now\nIt's the applause that dies\nWhen the praise is less\nIf my face is depressed\nThen, then\nIt's 'cause my value and worth's in the volume of the work I produce in the booth, in the booth\nIt's a prize and a curse if defined by the perks when the Truth is through, is through\nMan, I won't feel like I don't want to live no more, no more, no more, ha\n'Cause they don't like me, like they did in '04, '04, '04\nSo I swallow my pride empowered by God, I'm complete in Him\nHe's got peace, God's priest, I'm in\nIn His presence, weak is strength\nMeet His kin\nWe His brethren\nRead this list\nMe forgiven\nHe's dismissed\nGuilt and my sin and then I find my worth 'cause I'm Jesus' friend\n\n[Hook: J.R. & Lecrae]\nI'm not the shoes I wear\nI'm not the clothes I buy\nI'm not the house I live in\nI'm not the car I drive, no\nI'm not the job I work\nYou, you can't define my worth\nBy nothing on God's green earth\nMy identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ\n\n[Verse 3: Lecrae]\nGot her hair done, toes, nails\nIs that Her? Well, it's hard to tell\n'Cause she's so caked up in all that make up\nIt's like she tryna make up for what she ain't, but\nShe's a saint, but so confused\n'Cause she's been rejected by all these dudes\nThat tell her on a scale of ten, she's a two\nBut that ain't true\nIf she only knew\nIn Christ she is loved, she's secure and accepted\nNever be rejected by God who's elected her\nHer beauty is her godliness\nAnd she ain't gotta flaunt it 'cause it's obvious\nIdentity is found in the God we trust\nAny other identity will self destruct\nIdentity is found in the God we trust\nAny other identity will self destruct\nNow\u2014\n\n[Hook: J.R. & Lecrae]\nI'm not the shoes I wear\nI'm not the clothes I buy\nI'm not the house I live in\nI'm not the car I drive, no\nI'm not the job I work\nYou, you can't define my worth\nBy nothing on God's green earth\nMy identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
