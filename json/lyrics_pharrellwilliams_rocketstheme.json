They'll be coming for us soon\nCome on Rocket, we're going to the moon\nWe could shoot for the sun, but that'd be too soon\nSo one step at a time. Let's get the moon\n\n[Verse 1]\nSince you were a thought\nFloating around in our minds\nWe knew that you could teach us the true meaning of life\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nIs to try without fire and blast through all our fears\nYou can fly so much higher and take us all from here\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou could not be bought boy\nYou'd be sold out all the time\nWho wouldn't queue and long for\nThe vital meaning of life\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nWhich is to ride heart and mind and learn along the way\nFind our stride inside with no turbulence or sway\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bridge]\nYou're the one I promise you\nLove is your rocket fuel\nNothing is stopping you\nYou're special\nKeep climbing impossible\nA thousands of altitude\nIsn't that what God will do\nYou're special\n\n[Chorus](2x)", "year": null}]}
