We different\nYou complain that there's not enough metaphors\nI complain that there's not enough candy for us\nWe got different tastes, you get hot when you're not getting enough green\nUh, some more collard greens? I got enough pepper sauce\nYou hear things and let 'em go over your head\nI write 'em down and Google 'em before I go to bed\n'Nough said, pays the parallel park, rim brand, let the driver take a day, Big Sean got the big Benz instead\nYeah, and if you got all that, the result tab, points are factual, red\n\n[Hook: Big Sean]\nIt's on, roll up, post up\nHere come the pig seats and pose up\nAnd tell 'em that we going all night\nCause we know what you like\nBentley know what you like\nBig Sean know what you like\n88 know what you like\nSo tell 'em that we going all night, alright?\n\n[Verse 2: Big Sean]\nI miss Cherie Amore I see\nWon't you come be my Cherie Amore for me?\nOui oui, baby I can make it better for we\nShe got that baby phat fat, not Kimora Lee\nI used to be underground like the pipeline\nNow I'm everywhere like Wi-Fi\nSo long on to a Don Corleone\nWho was known to be known off performing his songs\nAnd that's honest, I'm from a place that's so unprotected\nNeed more than a condom\nBut now a nigga label mates with Common\nSo how them haters feel? Shit, no comment\nYou like Kanye? He cool with Hov\nOh, you don't like Hov? Well I know you like Beyonc\u00e9\nAin't looking for a wife but, maybe a fianc\u00e9\nThe man on my team from the D like Chauncey\nBillups babe, mhm, and we could leave\nI'm tryna beat like 88 keys\nHigh living like we smoke 88 trees\nHot shit baby, I might radiate heat\nExcuse me if I don't come all cordial\nI don't mean to put you through this whole ordeal\nBaby I'm more real\nComing from a city where the niggas keep it popping like Orville\n\n[Hook: Big Sean]\nIt's on, roll up, post up\nHere come the pig seats and pose up\nAnd tell 'em that we going all night\nCause we know what you like\nBentley know what you like\nBig Sean know what you like\n88 know what you like\nSo tell 'em that we going all night, alright?"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
