We got some gloves over here. Pictures everywhere. Who\u2019s the boxer?\n- Me\n- You\u2019re the boxer?\n- Yeah\n- You a tough guy?\n- Yeah, tough enough\n- Really? What could you do?\n- To you?\n- Yeah\n\nYou getting brutalized!\n\n(Verse one)\n\nI\u2019m a street fighter like M. Bison\nI might bite you like Tyson, trife with a license\nPut ice on the cut, doctors\u2019ll be splicing it up\nRocky snuffed right to the gut\nI\u2019m a Spartan, start beef my fists will harden\nYou punch like a girl but you ain\u2019t Christy Martin\nYou get no love, hit you with no gloves\nDuff you like sure enough shove you no one\u2019s above\nMy thunder and lightning, your eyes sting\nNo wonder you need Visine, not surprising, London Prize Ring\nYou felt were ill, your black belt ain\u2019t shit\nWhen you\u2019re attacked in your jail cell you fainted\nWhile you\u2019re pumping dope in you I\u2019m jumping rope\nThere\u2019s no hope for you dope, chump, jealous lazy bum\nNo matter son I\u2019m training whether it\u2019s sunny or raining\nLike Sonny I\u2019m reigning, you Patterson\n\n(Chorus)\n\nYou realise when I close up your two eyes you getting brutalized\nSize you up, prize fight shit, die what, you getting brutalized\nFake tough guys break and snuff no compromise, you getting brutalized\nSize ain\u2019t shit, big guys victimized too, you getting brutalized\n\n(Verse two)\n\nYo I laugh at you fronters, a no-skill rider\nYou ain\u2019t no ill fighter, you telegraph punches\nShots thrown from the hip your dome split open\nHemotobin, you should\u2019ve known your shit\nDefence techniques from a knuckle-bone blitz\nYour knees buckle you\u2019re weak sucker, don\u2019t snitch\nDeal with it, real with it, it\u2019ll heal quick\nThen I\u2019ll run up on you again and bust open your shit\nTwice, three times, quadruple, rip apart pupils\nKick like marsupials hard and brutal\nThen watch how we get busy, you left dizzy\nLeft right hook where is he? Side step and you miss me\nWeapon the rugged ? for myself\nThug it, militants, weapons, our hands deadly, slug it out\nYou\u2019re bugging out, drugged up, get knocked out\nYour mouth plugged up with stitches, you\u2019re ugly now\n\n(Chorus)"}], "artist": "Necro"}
