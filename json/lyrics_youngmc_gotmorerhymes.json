{"songs": [{"title": "Got More Rhymes", "lyrics": "[ VERSE 1 ]\nNow from planet to planet, and from star to star\nIt doesn't really matter, baby, just who you are\nAnd from Earth to solar system, and to galaxy\nIt's real hard to get a ticket to hear Young MC\nBecause I rock like a professional, this ain't no lark\nYou either hear me at a party, or you see me in the park\nI rocked the many places far away from my home\nI guess that must be the reason why I'm so well known\nI rocked from Iowa to Idaho, Canada to Mexico\nI came into the place, you party people, just to let you know\nMy name is the Young MC, ladies want to come to me\nAnd when they're in my arms, the ladies never ever front on me\nThinkin that you know the deal, boy, why don't you be for real\nI love to rock the mic, and sometimes even rock the wheels of steel\nRock the place without a doubt, now I'm gonna turn it out\nSo listen very close, so I can tell you that it's all about\nRHYMES\n\nMore RHYMES\nParty people, I'm the Young MC, and I got RHYMES\nLet me tell you something\nYoung MC got more RHYMES\n\n[ VERSE 2 ]\nNow with a voice like this I rock so well\nBut I'm not Prince, Lionel Richie, or Patti Labelle\nI'm not the Cars, the Pretenders, or the B-52's\nMy name is Young MC, and I'm the one you should choose\nCause when the music comes in, the beat starts thumpin\nAnd I'm the only man to keep the girlies high jumpin\nI'm the doctor on the mic, and yes, I'm so sure\nThat all you need is one visit, then you'll be cured\nCause in the game of rap I am the referee\nWhen the others need help, they'll come to me\nLike Judge Joe Wapner on *The People's Court*\nMy name is Young MC, rockin on the mic is my sport\nAnd now you know, just from those 12 lines\nThat a fella like me never falls behind\nCause I'm the cream of the crop, and the leader of the pack\nOnce you give me the mic, you know there's no turnin back\nBecause I got more rhymes then the other guys do\nThey're just a monkey, I'm the whole damn zoo\nI can't use a book, I use a hefty bag\nBecause they're just a string, I'm the American flag\nI got more rhymes than water seen by a sailor\nMore than husbands of Elizabeth Taylor\nMore than Babe Ruth has hit home runs\nYo, my name is Young MC, so go out there and have some fun\nWith RHYMES\n\nMore RHYMES\nI gotta tell you something\nYoung MC got RHYMES\nParty people, I got more RHYMES\n\nBust it\n\n[ VERSE 3 ]\nRHYMES - what are these things that I talk about?\nHear them in the walkman everytime you wanna walk about\nNever lost a battle in which I fought\nAnd if rhyme was a crime, I'd never get caught\nI had to go to college, because I am an intellectual\nI only sleep with women, cause I am heterosexual\nRock the microphone anyplace, anytime\nThat's why I had to write a jam and call it Got More Rhymes\nNow as a consequence of this\nI'd like to make some sense of this\nAnd tell the party people all the reasons that I sent you this\nRHYME that I continue to say\nSchool starts in September, graduation in May\nAnd when I graduate RHYMES'll keep comin\nGirls try to flock and jock, but stop bummin\nCause I'm the kinda guy that you never wanna toy with\nAnd now you know that I'm talkin about the boy with\nRHYMES\n\nMore RHYMES\nWhen you say Young MC, you are sayin RHYMES\nParty people, Young MC got more RHYMES\nYeah", "album": "Stone Cold Rhymin\u2019", "year": "1989-09-05", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7e9ff08751b8e32d468ac9e4127b8bec.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young MC"}
