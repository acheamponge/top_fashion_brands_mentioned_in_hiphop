Dem dons never kept none\nCheck, their work never gets done\nI was at that stage, went to the next one\n\n[Chorus]\nWe used to think of play-ay\nThen I had to take a hike-ike\nSay you're gonna change your life-ife\nBut you say that all the time-ime\nWe used to think of play-ay\nThen I had to take a hike-ike\nSay you're gonna change your life-ife\nBut you say that all the time-ime\n\n[Bridge]\nSay you're gonna change your life-ife\nBut you say that all the time-ime\nWe used to think of play-au\nThen I had to take a hike-ike\n\n[Chorus]\nWe used to think of play-ay\nThen I had to take a hike-ike\nSay you're gonna change your life-ife\nBut you say that all the time-ime", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d498a13cfb08ff2a64ba27cf8333fc0c.800x800x1.jpg", "album": "Godfather II", "title": "All the Time"}]}
