I'm good money\nGot you talking in dollar signs\nIt's all good that she the top bitch\nBut she just wanna know the bottom line\nI don't blame her, I don't change her\nI just sit back and give her options\nPhillip Lim, Derek Lam\nEvery baller gotta know she's sponsored\nWhoo! You earned that\nNow where the fuck did you learn that?\nWe turnt up, we turnt out\nWe too far gone to ever turn back\n\n[Chorus: Kevin Gates]\nThese women ain't shit but hoes with tricks\nBaby girl, you different\nWhen you're not around, it feels like something's missing\nAnd I know you keep it real\nNever tell no lie\nKnow you heard what they say\nTrue love is hard to find\nI just might trust you with my drugs\nTrust you with my money\nJust might trust you with my drugs\nMight trust you with my money\nGirl, I'll trust you with my drugs\nMight trust you with my money\nMight just trust you with my drugs\nMight trust you with my money, girl\n\n[Verse 2: Pusha T]\nLocked phones, past tense\nPass codes, we past this\nPass time, Presidential\nRolexes, both sexes\nBlue bezel we both flexing\nBig diamonds, we Bowflexing\nPitch dope, touch down\nBoth sports, I'm Bo Jackson\nYour bitch fronting, that's you\nMy bitch stunting, that's me\nI break it down, then break her off\nI'm breaking bread, and that's key\nWe everything that they talk about\nKnow them haters be watching\nThem bitches lurking -- your page locked\nAnd they still know when you shopping\nThey still know that I'm balling\nYou still know that I'm all in\nYour ex nigga, your next nigga\nGon' hate the fact that I'm spoiling\nWhoo! But you earned that\nNow where the fuck did you learn that?\nWe turnt up, we turnt out\nWe too far gone to ever turn back\n\n[Chorus: Kevin Gates]\nThese women ain't shit but hoes with tricks\nBaby girl, you different\nWhen you're not around, it feels like something's missing\nAnd I know you keep it real\nNever tell no lie\nKnow you heard what they say\nTrue love is hard to find\nI just might trust you with my drugs\nTrust you with my money\nJust might trust you with my drugs\nMight trust you with my money\nGirl, I'll trust you with my drugs\nMight trust you with my money\nMight just trust you with my drugs\nMight trust you with my money, girl\n\n[Outro: Kevin Gates]\nPlease don't mind\nI just need some time\nThese requirements\nJust gotta make sure you meet all mine\nStanding there staring, with your bow-legged stance\nTrust being nothing you could hold in your hand\nHustle in the hood, strong with the bands\nLook at you as something more than a ho I could smash\nOr being something bad I could bone at the bag\nPole in my pants standing at attention\nWhen you step out of the shower and your ass is wiggling\nGlance at the ceiling\nNow your glass is empty\nThinking backwards, really\nI done grabbed a vixen\nThat supposed to be a fitter after video\nStacks'll really blow\nDancers get exposed\nMissing you when you not around\nWe text each other when out of town\nYou remain the same no matter up or down\nThese other women stay pretending\nMoney come and they help us spend it\nBut'll fuck my niggas in the very minute\nI was down and out and had to go to prison\nKinda high role play, acki\nAnd again I say I like these hoes", "year": "2013-01-28"}]}
