I got a ghetto pass I'm allowed to be down\nI'm a walk into your town like a bum or a clown\nAs soon as I open my mouth you hear the thunderous sound\nI'm a lyrical elephant it' s not a miracle to become eloquent\nI might keep going (.....????.....) quit\nMe inside your heart, yo I hella fit\nWest coast underground hip-hop is relevant\nSo go ahead and dissolve in the illusion\nI know this song ain' t solve the resolution\nYou might catch me in an Escalade\nBut I don't make hip-hop to have sex and get paid\n\n[Hook]\n\nAnd the chow shall feed them\nAnd the chow shall feed them\nThe return of Fernandomania\n\nAnd the chow shall feed them\nAnd the chow shall feed them\nThe return of Fernandomania\n\nAnd the chow shall feed them\nAnd the chow shall feed them\nThe return of Fernandomania", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ef89fa326d5eee915df867494b6233c.700x700x1.jpg"}], "artist": "2Mex"}
