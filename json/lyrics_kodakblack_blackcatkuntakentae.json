I'm on that Effen vodka, smoking gas\nYeah, beep, beep, I'm the nigga roadrunning to that cash\nFuck a frisbee, I'll spin n' bend a nigga like I'm Taz\nFuck my daddy, I can't believe I nutted out your sack\nFuck my daddy nigga, it's me and my momma sons like I'm Nash\nI made my son king, put this crown on, fuck a ski mask\nI swear to god, I get a hard on when this heat blast\nType it like a spacebar, fuck a keypad, think I keep that Mac\nHot shifter, can't control my pace, command, delete his ass\n\n[Chorus]\nFeel like somebody put a cast on my ass\nI'm dropping bad luck, I pull up in the black Jag\nCan't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half\nI'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past\nFeel like somebody put a cast on my ass\nI'm dropping bad luck, I pull up, the black Jag\nCan't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half\nI'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm hooked on phonics, hooked on Phoenix balling like I'm Steve Nash\nPromise you ain't see me, I was in Buffalo with Ray\nHow you finna cut the hole, y'all just bad\nIn Charlotte, made a movie with that poker, left a scab\nIn Raleigh, fell in love with fraud, [?] on that slazz\nSteady scheming, burying cheese and burying pieces in the grass\nControversy between the both supremacies, they gone be mad\nMartin Luther King, last night I had a dream about his ass\nNo Rosa Parks, them shooters posted in the back\nNelson Mandela, rocking Maison Margielas, remember wearing Shaqs\nLife's a gamble, play the hands they dealt me I'm a wizard at blackjack\nIn the Jaguar XF, putting a spell on you late night in the black cat\n\n[Chorus]\nFeel like somebody put a cast on my ass\nI'm dropping bad luck, I pull up in the black Jag\nCan't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half\nI'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past\nFeel like somebody put a cast on my ass\nI'm dropping bad luck, I pull up, the black Jag\nCan't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half\nI'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past"}]}
