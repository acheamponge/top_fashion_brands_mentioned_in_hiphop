Never been a dealer\nNever glorified that, just the character it built\nThe game's real and you find out quick\nWhen you want the Bentley, the Porsche ain't shit\nNot a chain from Jacob, what I need is a wake up\nAnd this pain my heart got the weight of an anchor\nAnd still I thank the good Lord for health\nAnd the peace that you get when you right with yourself\n\n[Hook: Pharrell Williams]\n\"Come go with me\nI make you feel right\"\nThat's what the dope man used to say\nBringing cocaine in the jam\n\"Come go with me\nI'll make you feel right\"\nThat's what all the dope men say\nBringing cocaine in the jam", "year": null}]}
