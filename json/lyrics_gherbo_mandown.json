I'm tryna make it nigga\nWhy you want me to be broke and stay a basic nigga?\nWhy niggas wanna see me dead? Tryna see me down\nSame niggas shake my hand when they see me 'round\nLet you know for you gotta watch em\nThey gon drop a dime or kill you for a dollar\nAnd I gotta watch my back cause I know niggas plottin'\nSame nigga who say he ya partna' he'll pop-pop\nAnd I'm ridin' round tryna ease the pain\nSmoking on dutches drink a ace of lean\nHigh speedin' and I'm switching lanes\nTired of talkin Ballin Like I'm Kobe on the way\n\n[Outro]\nRIP all my niggas man\nFree all my niggas man\nBallin Like I'm Kobe on the mixtape\nComing real soon man\nYou already know what it is man\nPistol gang, 4L\nYou already know how we rocking man\nPPP Man\nLet's get it man\nWe don't fuck around we gotta get this money man\nFuck all that other shit"}]}
