Pride hurt by spite\nFight for who you like, but who you like ain't always right\nFirst become rivals, life moves in cycles\nBarely use a libel, find that Mary Jane insightful\nWhen my heart\u2019s on probation, caught by police\nCopped me a spaceship, cocked it and peace\nConstant vacation, lost out at sea\nQuit my job and relationship, that's why I roll this weed\nLike\n\n[Chorus]\nUntil it goes away, until it goes away\nUntil it goes I\u2019m smoking\nUntil it goes away, until it goes away\nUntil it goes I\u2019m smoking\nUntil it goes away, until it goes away\nUntil it goes I\u2019m smoking\nUntil it goes away, until it goes away\nUntil it goes I\u2019m smoking\n\n[Verse 3: Chuck Inglish]\nI thought you were the one girl to make me happy\nWe rolled a couple ones up glad we made it happen\nBut I ain\u2019t losing sleep just to keep the peace\nI roll up all my tree up, let me tell you what I see\nThe peace of disagrence, push the word until you breathe it\nLike the sermon when you see it, man, I say it like I mean it\nFogged deep, windows up in the truck, getting weeded\nThere\u2019s a war going on outside and I can\u2019t hear it\nI hold the THC in my lungs until I feel it\nStoned like a witch \u2018cause life is a bitch\nLast night I sat down, had to write\nTwist that light, an extended take flight\nMan, I gotta pack light, but\n\n[Chorus]\nUntil it goes away, until it goes away\nUntil it goes I\u2019m smoking\nUntil it goes away, until it goes away\nUntil it goes I\u2019m smoking\nUntil it goes away, until it goes away\nUntil it goes I\u2019m smoking\nUntil it goes away, until it goes away\nUntil it goes I\u2019m smoking", "year": "2014-04-22"}]}
