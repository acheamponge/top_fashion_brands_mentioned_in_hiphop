I won't argue with you, you know best\nThere's no test - I haven't passed\nYou test me you'll be the past - you'll be a walking cadaver fast\nThat's what you want, that's what you get\nWanna get cut off? We'll cut off your head\nI offer instead the chance to turn your body around in a stance\nNot facing me you must learn to follow my commands\nFuck back packers! You fudge-packers\nShout outs to thugs and cats that pack axes\nDeath to new jacks, you're gassed cuz you made a track\nYour ass, you get played and cracked and the blade'll be shoved in your back\nBreak his fucking face!! Now kid\nBash it, smash it, he asked for it - slash it\nBut I might get caught? So what?\nDo it anyway, bring the onslaught - everyday\nIt's like I gotta kill somebody, now matter how hard I try to be good\nI can't, you won't let me - now start getting deadly\nGrab the buck knife - fuck life\nFuck him, fuck you - now tell me what's the price!?\n25 to life or you living? I'd rather you see dead\nGood riddance - your head fucking split in\nRelease aggression, swing a fist\nBlast a gun, crack a bat - over somebody's back\nI'll never be done - ever - that's how Satan made it\nCreated all of us to be filled with hatred\nPain and anger - buck off the banger\nFuck off you piece of shit I'll strangle ya'\nYou getting cracked in the face with brass knuckles on my fist\nFuck you - you're a bitch - I should stuff you in a ditch\nSo puff a spliff - smoke your shit to this\nGet you open like a clitoris - shove a knife in your tits\nIts not simplistic it's technical\nWhen someone sadistic stabs you in your ventricles\nMad thought takes place - should I stab him in the face or in the waist?\nYou get replaced and erased\nNow face the burners G - one hundred bullets enter your body\nNow you're dead for eternity - you can't come back\nWhen you're stabbed like a thumb tack - I'm addicted to gats\nLike uncle Howie does crack - so spark the stem\nAnd I'mma teach you kids why your carcass is a gem\nStudy the bloody - my butcher knife lingo\nRips you to pieces - unos, dose, tres, quatro, cinqo - holes in your back\nBurn you to death - charcoal - black ashes attack your soul with an axe\nJus' because you're dead - doesn't mean you're really dead\nI'd rather kill you in the afterlife instead\nYou ain't getting no peace - but rest in peace\nPieces - one thousand parts at least - the maggots in hell will feast\nYou'll be deceased at least three times before the pain begins to decrease..."}], "artist": "Necro"}
