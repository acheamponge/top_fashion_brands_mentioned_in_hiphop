It was the only one Bob Marley ever did play in Africa\nYou write raps, I write history on the page\nAnd quite literally, an elder statesman to my own generation\nAn inspiration cause the flows that I came with is a solo play by Miles Davis\nWho don\u2019t know he\u2019s the greatest?\nSo if Charlie tells anybody else their fire in the booth is the best there\u2019s been\nIs he high? Does he lie?\nNah, he knows that I\u2019m in my own league\n\n[Verse 2]\nI\u2019m judged totally separate\nIf we are actually going on the evidence\nYou wanna be a foe? Do you know what the level is?\nYou wanna be a pro? Can you roll with the cleverest?\nGenius, I know it\nKinda like a road side thug yet a poet\nKinda like a warrior, kinda like a scholar\nBut I can be an asshole, don\u2019t make me show it\nI know a certain kind of supporters\nDon\u2019t like it when I get this boasty\nYou think that I care?\nAll that show, you don\u2019t really know me\nSee, I\u2019m an arrogant fuck on the mic\nI am not humble, I\u2019m only nice in real life\nWho wants an MC that does not think they\u2019re the shit?\nThat defeats the whole point - combat sport's this rap stuff\nThat\u2019s why a man gets slapped when he act up\nThey cannot catch us, they will get backed up\nYou can feel the energy coming through the chakras\nNo aggression, the hood\u2019s not listening\nCause aggression is what they\u2019re living in\nSo I keep spittin\u2019 it, everyday I\u2019m spinning \u2018em\nCall me Akala, there is no synonym\nNobody\u2019s similar, not the same\nI rap about life, they rap about chains\nYet, we all get dough and we all drive Mercs\nAll do festivals, all get work\nWe don\u2019t all lecture at Oxford with a hoodie on\nCause I got no response for their nonsense\nDon\u2019t all do education in warzones, man are shook to go Peckham\nDespite all the big talk\nThey would not walk in half of the places I step in\nCatch me in anyone\u2019s hood on my own\nKids act like they seen a ghost\nI\u2019m like little bro, \"I\u2019m thirty-two years old, you think I care about a postcode?\"\nI am not invincible, I could get removed from the physical\nBut if I get murked, probably be political\nCause the things that come out of my mouth is a madness\nI am a rebellious bastard with no respect for authority\nSo I don\u2019t suggest that you follow me\nIt\u2019s true this could all end horribly\nBut I\u2019ll still be the anomaly, an entrepreneur\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don\u2019t say it cause it sounds cool, it\u2019s actually true\nAin\u2019t got a diamond chain, I admit it\nBut I do got an office with employees in it\nDo take youngsters all around the globe\nGet them paid for their brain and their lyrics\nWhile our media want to still paint us like we are just nothing but crooks\nAlong comes one so cool\nHe can make it cool to rap about books\nAnd you can think that\u2019s neeky and stupid\nBut all that shows that you\u2019re clueless\nCause the global revenue for books every year is like ten times more than music\nHmmmm, now I have sold how many books?\nAnd self-publish, how does that look?\nFor those that only respect cheques\nSwear the accountant ain\u2019t cookin\u2019 the books, son\nAnd I don\u2019t even think that capitalism should decide how you rate a rap on a rhythm\nThat is the age we\u2019re living in, isn\u2019t it?\nIt\u2019s all about materialism\nMore important than any paper debt, do you check for the youthdem?\nLet\u2019s see, any one of them little thugs right there\nHe could have been me, he could have been me\nIt could have been me\n\n[Verse 4]\nFifteen, I was in chimes[?] and trends\nColiseum way back then surrounded by big men\nIn the clap of a skeng\nYou know what was being smoked in green, but everybody pretends\nThis time I kicked ball for the Hammers\nWeed and the girls put a spanner in the matters\nFact of the matter is, lost my discipline\nLate night bredrin, whip with a stick in it\nHe took it from under his dad\u2019s mattress\nI never grew up with dad, who\u2019s better off?\nComplicated, I\u2019m undercompensating\nEverybody talks road, I let \u2018em fake it\nMy olders would organize crime, they lick banks\nSo I ain\u2019t gassed when you say you bag grams\nBadman, what's that? Madman, stop that\nThey manufacture gats, we just pop that\nThey import, export, we just shot that\nHustle, I ain\u2019t saying I knock that\nI\u2019m just saying we should see it\u2019s deliberate\nAnd by now we should all be sick of it\nI\u2019m working on ways to get rid of it\nMass incarceration, ridiculous\nSo I go to jail and I chat to the mandem\nFire in the Booth Part 1\nWhat I rapped them? Explaining the system and how it will trap them\nAction more than rap then, hmm\nAll my Fire in the Booths, they have been studied as texts\nBy countless PhDs \u2018round the globe\nMy youth now have some respect\nAnd they still bang on the block, from Brixton to Brooklyn\nPalestine to West Papua\nBut despite all the personal comfort, I still feel sick when I think of the massacres\nThe world is fucked\nThere is enough to go around, but we are ruled by -(cunts)-\n\"There he goes preaching again\nAkala, Stick to the script, just stunt\nTell \u2018em about your whip, brand new something and sit\nHow many girls wanna...\nWell cuz\u2019, come on, let\u2019s be honest\nI was not ugly before this shit\n\n[Verse 5]\nSo you can imagine, but the brain power you cannot fathom\nI mean it truly from the bottom of my heart\nThough please jump on the bandwagon\nI\u2019ve made it cool to be conscious again, say thanks\nCause I know that you\u2019ve got more sense\nI know that you know yourself\nWhen you are sat down with your gran and her friends\nThat\u2019s our culture, respect for the olders\nIf you snort coke then we call you a cokehead, no biggie\nWant to rap with Akala?

Go to a lifer\u2019s wing\nLook the mandem in the eyes\nDone that many times, got one too many rhymes\nThe London in my lines, a dungeon for these guys\nQuestioned them to find, a hundred at a time\nMuster and define, the cusp of what is rhyme\nClutchin\u2019 and I climb, I pop the level line\nWas always at the top, but now they recognize\nTrust that you recline when I go double time\nThe flow is so ridiculous, I be the prophesised\nGuys are ill-advised to dive into a fight\nWith I, the wicked eye, you will never get a blight\n\n-Ruins Of Empire Piece-\n\n[Verse 11]\nAnd it seems I was there\nWhere? Everywhere\nEvery battle ever fought\nEvery stab, every shot\nThrough the ages of humans, this killing machine\nI could feel everything though\nIt wasn\u2019t a dream\nI was every soldier that had ever fought\nWith a shield and a sword\nAll the blood ever drawn\nFrom a dagger, or a bayonet\nAn axe that will slay your neck\nAutomatic gats that clap only spraying, death\nI was in a tank that exploded in Iraq\nIn a drive-by in gang wars spraying out of cars\nI was in \u2018Nam, dropping napalm, but it burned my skin\nI was also Viet Minh\nI was an Italian massacring Ethiopians\nBut the bullets only pierced my flesh because I was both of them\nI could feel every single wound of the flesh\nBut also the pleasure of causing the death\nI was a soldier of the Caliphate on a crusade, a killer\nUsing Christ in exactly the same way\nI was every woman ever killed in a witch hunt\nOr every little girl forced to grow with a split soul\nCause men like to snip clits and zip bits closed\nSo the rape feels nice\nBefore they take my life\nI was fighting for liberation, a woman and general\nBringing death to cowards that sold my genitals\nOne moment I killed to be freed\nThe next, I was a monarch that killed for my greed\nThutmose the Third\nAlexander the Fake\nCaesar, Napoleon, Francis Drake\nThe arms of the state, the armies that are great\nBut I was also the resistance that\u2019s hardly ever praised\nI was every indigenous person of America\nThat died trying to protect their homes from a predator\nThen the robe-cladden Roman senator\nAnd every noble that showed you the ways of the treacherous\nI was in the Belgian Congo hacking off limbs\nIn Rwanda, Akazu doing the same thing\nI was a Japanese general occupying the Philippines\nA Filipino child too young to know what it means\nI was at Sharpeville, I was just two\nMy mother, with a bullet in her head, and I knew\nBarely out of her womb, I played with her wound\nI knew life was a cycle, she\u2019ll be back soon\nI was a soldier of Ashanti resisting the British\nBut at the same time still selling humans to the Dutch\nIf you\u2019re honest with yourself and you look back through human history you\u2019d see that we\u2019re totally fucked\nCause I was that little girl in that church in Alabama\nThen [?] was a [?] Margaret Sanger\nThen I was Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr\nFeeling just fine in a B-29\nI did my job\nOne-hundred thousand dead\n-(Greasy. Yellow. Japs)-\nI went home to relax\nThen I was every child ever born with deformed limbs\nCause they were just pawns on a board to inform kings\nI saw sharks following ships, intrigued by the trail that comes overboard\nI saw sharks following the ship I was on I knew then that it couldn\u2019t be long\nWe had tried to get free\nBut as if that were wrong\nWe were thrown overboard from the deck of the Zong\nSo many bodies that the sharks couldn\u2019t finish the flesh\nIt took the waves to administer death\nAnd I joined the rest at the bottom of the sea\nThe uncounted millions that dreamed to be free\nThe next minute I was back on a ship\nThis time as a soldier of the French\nRight off the coast of Haiti we made a gas chamber for African rebels, I couldn\u2019t deal with the stench\nThen my head was chopped off\nBy one of Dessalines\u2019 henchmen\nHe gave the order for killing all Frenchmen\nThen all I could see was pyramids\nCan you see?\nDesigned by man's mind but built by his greed\nThe strangest pyramids, I ever did see\nWas not built by stones, but the bones of families", "year": "2016-06-04", "album": "10 Years of Akala", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bd174bbb42265536ee1741370f5dc593.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
