I ain't selfish, I'm just gettin what I deserve, you know? I worked hard for this shit. I never took no handouts, never asked y'all for nothin homie\n\n[Hook]\nWhat you gonna do when you ain't got anymore friends\nNo more weed, money's all spent\nAfter everything, all you got is you\nSo take care of yourself and do what you gotta do\nWhat you gonna do when you ain't got anymore friends\nNo more weed, money's all spent\nAfter everything, all you got is you\nSo take care of yourself and do what you gotta do", "year": "2012-11-18"}]}
