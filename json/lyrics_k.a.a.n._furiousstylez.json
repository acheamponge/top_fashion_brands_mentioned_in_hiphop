K.A.A.N.]\nLawd, ay, knowledge, January 12th, ay, lawd, look\n\n[Verse]\nConsider me one of the best, you can attest, my lyrics upon, your prodigal sons, passing you prominence never puns\nI promise I punish mine when I'm punching pages with pens, you can pretend, never assuming that you know me at all\nA post-apocalyptic, policy, Pentecostal apologies, apostles prophesied with the power that I preceded with\nPoseidon, with the proper propaganda endorsed, I propose a toast with propofol  to make a lethal injection\nMy flow could slice and cut your gut like a cesarean section, Very selective when deciding when to make an incision\nI said my mind is an annuity, stories like Mephistopheles\nMy legend shall ascend to the level of Greek mythology, and everything is factual, pathological fallacies have never been allowed as I lie upon Zeus' cloud, and you follow this young Apollo that plays with a golden lyre\nAnd I feel that i shall adhere to these allegations complicity a system I'm sadistic, cinematic's an atrocity\nSimplistically consistent of sorrows and many sins of similes and homonyms with homeric hymns for your friends\nAnd you feel it like sharp syringes, it's soft essence was soothing\nIt sterilizes the negatives, cerebral as a sedative inside my active mind, in time I find that I'm a genius\nOdysseus' legendary, eloquent speaker, cunning and coming for the knowledge that you claim to be carrying\nSuffocating and I exit on my four horse chariot\nGalavant with generosity, all you rappers are Hermes, another god to commerce, but tell me what your soul worth\nI converse, in a concert, never concern, with yo content, in a convent, and it makes sense, I am all in, not complex, like I been invested in a sicker vision I can see it's something that the people need, I write another rhyme, it's like the pen is leaking, I am at the beacon, with a happy preacher, and a pessimist that's talking blasphemous\nBring it back, the flow is too amazing, I am innovating, you are emulating, you're insinuated, you are on the level, you can never be, as I proceed to teach, and I have built a fort that you can never breach\nYou wasn't ready for me, feeling incomplete, please don't compete, you will not beseech, you are obsolete, I am far from weak, my seinen represent to me, when it's looking bleak, be the first to preach\nI guarantee, you can't crack my faith, got up-scored taste, but the kid don't wait, my fate, if you really wanna hold your breath, vocab impress, my mind's a mess, I stress about my death a lot, the solitary seat I'm spinning, I'm sitting in Camelot\nI'm the head of the table, decapitate with Excalibur, calibrated my consciousness, it's of a higher caliber\nThirty feet in diameter, my poetic pentameter, passes the condescending, it's consequences are misery, viciously vindicate, liberate, but its expeditions leave as Plymouth Rock, the pompous place  this place composing my all\nI picked the perfect hemisphere like where humanity start, and was innovated, raped, and pillaged, now it's dearly departed, indigenous people possessing prominence that was reason, It was Kings and High Priests, but now we believe in Jesus, blue-eyed and blonde hair for gentrifying the thesis and descending us to something, slaves, I cannot conceive it but you take it as the gospel and think that it's concrete, we could start it in the {?} your o zealous testified when you died as high in the sky, and was documented in genesis, Exodus and Leviticus, Now in the beginning, God created heavens and Earth It was formless and filled with darkness that reigned all over the surface, the spirit of the omnipotent hovered over the water, divided the day and night and then said \"Well let there be light\"\nNow ain't that great, but where's the evolution of that verse, and if it was written by a man, well then there's lies in them words\nI think that we were given religion so we questioning less\nObsessing over all of your instincts, worry about what they think They giving false opinions like it mattered at all\nNot to mention many wars that all these deities started\nAs we crusade into to the current, I noticed the recreation of ignorance in the mind of this impotent generation generation, I think that I'll take it deeper, look how you viewing these places of infinite destitution, no resolution for poverty, Western Ideologies, only causing illusions, that's similar to mirages, remarkable mental martyrs that marginalize the struggle, a load that you never carrying, so everyone that's from the middle east is now a terrorist, embarrassing that you can't even see what it is, we from a place that takes the culture that we don't understand, and tell the people how to live while we raping yo land, taking every natural resource you have at your hand, you have it back, of course, for a discount price, there's no remorse within the fact that we have ruined your life, we gotta make sure that our vices and our pockets contrite, but you don't like it, not at all, so what you gon' do?, fight?, shit, get a steady hand, and finished plan, and you get infiltrated by a white man, with a lot of guns, and the biggest bomb, please don't move, we got napalm, so your plan's warped, put your hands up, We\u2019re gonna need the oil, yeah all of it, and that\u2019s every drop no we never stop, 'till we say so, you got a problem with it?, I ain't think so\n\n[Outro: K.A.A.N.]\nLawd, knowledge, ay"}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
