These are highly processed grains, that really are not good for you in the first place. And then they add insult to injury with things like yellow 6 and blue number 2, these artificial colors again are something we wanna avoid, especially when we talk about things that we're going to be giving to our children", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7c1dd79f5e740daf40ac14e92f0f0bef.999x999x1.jpg", "album": "The Cookout Chronicles", "title": "Lackadaisical"}]}
