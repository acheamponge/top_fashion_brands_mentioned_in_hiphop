average kid\nThe type of Latina I'd sit and contemplate marriage with\nFuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire\nDisciplined, intellectual beauty is what I desire\nFlyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez\nEveryone told me, kickin' it to her was hopeless\nAt first I just thought she didn't mess with broke kids\nThe thug niggas always talkin' about how they smoke kids\nBut the rich sniff-coke kids got no play\n\"I'm not even interested\" is what her body language would say\nEveryone around the way gave up tryin' to get in it\nIt didn't matter how good your game was, she wasn't with it\nOn the block, bitches was jealous but wouldn't admit it\nTalk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it, \u2018cause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it\nAnd no one ever gave them shit except McDonald's and did-dick\nSmokin' weed, with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it\nShe spoke intelligently and they bit it, always tryin' to copy\nBut when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy\nShe had a style, all her own, respectful and pure\nI was sick in the head for her, and there wasn't a cure\n\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nDon't you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it's all planned\nI'm blessed just to know you\nI've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night\nCan't find a reason why\nGod came between you and I\nIf I had the chance again, I'd never let you go\nHold tight to your love, \u2018cause you never know\n\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nHer eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad\nI used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad\nThat I wasn't just another nigga tryin' to get in it\nSo every now and then we'd stop and talk for a minute\nI didn't have a gimmick, so the minutes turned to hours\nOn her birthday I gave her a poem with flowers\nThen I took her out to dinner after her cousin's baby shower\nWe talked about power to the people and such\nWe spent more time together, but it was never enough\nI never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel\nI was too interested in keepin' it real\nPerfectly honest and complete\nShe would always call me \"cari\u00f1o\" and never Technique\nBought me a new book to read every two or three weeks\nForever changin' the expression of my thoughts when I speak\nIt was because of her I even deaded all of my freaks\nShe convinced me to stop hangin' out on the streets\nTo stop robbin' and stealin' from people like you\nInstead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo\nMuseo del Barrio, and the Metropolitan too\nGot to the point when I was either with her or my crew\nSo I decided one day to tell her my feelings was true\nI couldn't live without her, so I told her, facin' my fears\nBut honey's only response was a face full of tears\nShe could only sob hysterically, holdin' me tight\nI tried to speak, but she wouldn't stop until I left sight\nI felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light\nExcept I didn't burn, I turned cold after that night\n\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nDon't you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it's all planned\nI'm blessed just to know you\nI've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night\nCan't find a reason why\nGod came between you and I\nIf I had the chance again, I'd never let you go\nHold tight to your love, \u2018cause you never know\n\n[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]\nI went on with my life, college and my career\nEnded up locked up like an animal for a year\nWhere the C.O.'s talk to you like they were the overseer\nThen I got sent to the hole when my exit was near\nAt night in my cell, I'd close my eyes and I'd see her\nHold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared\nJust an empty cell until the state gave me parole\nIn the summer, came back, intact and on track\nBut the fact of the matter is I still felt cold\nEven after my mother hugged me, cryin' at home\nMy real niggas would catch me thinkin', outta my zone\nFuckin' lots of different women, but I still felt alone\nRelatively well-known around the New York underground\nBut I kept thinkin' of her and how we used to be down\nThe sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair\nThough gone physically, somehow it was still there\nI had to do somethin' because the shit was too much to bear\nSo I went and visited the building where she used to live\nThe world looks a lot different after you do a bid\nThe way your life done changed\nWhile primitive minds are still stuck in the same game\nLike her cousin who was on the corner, slangin' cocaine\nStepped in the lobby, and tapped the button next to her last name\nHer mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta\nBut her facial expression changed\nWhen I asked about her daughter\n\n[Hook: Jean Grae]\nDon't you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it's all planned\nI'm blessed just to know you\nI've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night\nCan't find a reason why\nGod came between you and I\nIf I had the chance again, I'd never let you go\nHold tight to your love, \u2018cause you never know\n\n[Verse 4: Immortal Technique]\nShe told me that there was a note, for me, that was left behind\nAnd she had left it there waitin' for such a long time\nI was inclined to ask about it, but she brought it up first\nI saw a tear swellin' up in her eye, and then she cursed\nShe told me where the letter was, and I started thinkin' the worst\nReversed my position, stepped over and opened the door\nAnd sure enough there was an envelope\nWith my name on the floor: \"Nobody loves you more than me, cari\u00f1o,\" is what the letter said\n\"By the time you get to read this, I'll probably be dead\nBut when you left in '97, a part of me went to Heaven\nI thank God at least I got to know what love really was\nBut it hurt me to see what true love really does\n\u2018Cause even though we never made love\nYou were all that there was\nIt was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave\nYou made me doubt the way I thought\nYou made me want to believe\nAnd then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me\nIt was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me\nThis was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be\nBaby, don't you see?\nI had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV\nHope didn't exist for me since late in 1993\nI died a virgin, I wish I could've given myself to you\nI cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you\nPromise that you'll meet me in Paradise inevitably\nNo matter what, I'll keep your love forever with me.\"\nWhat happened for the rest of the day is still a blur\nBut I remember wishin' that I was dead, instead of her\nShe was buried on August 3rd\nThe story ends without a sequel; and now you know why Technique don't fuckin' fall in love with people\nHold the person that you love closely if they're next to you\nThe one you love, not the person that'll simply have sex with you\nAppreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond\n\u2018Cause you never really know what you got until it's gone", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c628c98f9d53f039b060e7f0369c15b4.220x220x1.jpg", "album": "Revolutionary Vol. 2",
