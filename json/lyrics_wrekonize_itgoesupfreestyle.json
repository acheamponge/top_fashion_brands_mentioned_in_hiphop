John wick clip\nRip shit rhymers are hype as a hibiscus\nLive\u200a this every night grinding we like wiz kids\nSickness\u200a all in my lining it\u2019s quite cryptic\nRap patterns that batter them like hammers and\nAmateurs\u200a can\u2019t hang with shenanigans try grappling\nHandle them like baggage that shatters we magnanimous\nRavenous can\u2019t slang with the hatters that bang Alices\nBetter be on your job cuz you might fucking need it\nLazy\u200a motherfuckers cry to be the zenith\nYou really think it\u2019s just scenic when you\u2019ve become the phoenix\nBut how can you stomach the heat if you\u2019re bulimic\nWe Run with elitists that\u2019s known to wreak of genius\nAin\u2019t a secret we been the meanest the coldest in the genus\nDouble helix it\u2019s in my DNA to be twice the meanest\nChrist defeated Demons strategic trying to find the weakest\n\n[Verse 2: Bernz]\nOooooh Vacay for like days\nWhen Tech N9ne called and he asked for MAYDAY\nUbi dax and Kaliko all came\nNow the whole damn club is fucking or engaged\nTour of duty so unruly\nSaving all the stories for when we makin the movie\nTearing up the crowd every night its a thing of beauty\nTill we in the afterparty and smoking too many doobies bitch\nShouts to security for all the drinks\nI think I need me a sabbatical after this shit\nI know u think u know but homie its a fucking Myth\nNo one could ever really understand the life we live\nLove me or leave me alone\nIs now the only attitude I\u2019m feeling when i perform\nFeel like I\u2019m in a dream team and a night mare to ya'll\nSo don\u2019t wake up if I sleep walk\n\n[Verse 3: Dax]\nYeah uh, I need a dollar for every person who doubted me\nTo buy my soul back from the people who took it out of me\nIndependent greatness embedded, I'm on my Master P\nI'm try'na stack it higher for niggas' who coming after me\nI got a couple things I want to discuss\nWhy's masculinity defined by niggas' acting so tough\nWhy is my happiness reflected by me buying so much\nAnd spending money on these women when it's never enough\nIntrospective had to peep it from my new perspective\nHalf of the shit they told me was a lie, and they was so deceptive\nI was never one to make connections, yeah, I lack reception\nPromised I would get it on my own and never be dependent\nSo who you answer to?\nI answer to God\nNo entity, man-made machine, no fraud\nI'm the CEO so see me go far\nNo rap, no cap, that's facts, it's Dax\n\n[Verse 4: Ubi]\nI Can't deny it\nWhy try it I'm a veteran\nI don't know why you hyping like you better than\nAnd you can try and hide it but no\nI'm kinda psychic like Eleven is\nA lot of rappers writing, but they type is quite repetitive\nI'm selfish with the bars\nIn private life I'm generous\nI can't entertain y'all silly diatribes and rhetoric\nThe game's a motherfucker we idolize an oedipus\nTell leadership that we we desire higher benefits\nI'm holding my breath\nY'all know the rest\nOlder ex member show up\nStill hoping we coalesce\nIt's over, go with regret\nThey say that all of that hate is affecting your brain chemistry\nUh I tell them that they can expect the same energy\nYeah, came to collect and drain\nTaking your breath away\nThey caress your flesh and then take a rest in the Everglades\nFavored and decorated greater when separated\nEvery day and second I gave it labor and effort made it yeah\n\n[Verse 5: Krizz Kaliko]\nI been way too generous and general people all on my genitals\nMentally bent and the fentanyl's hit and got no sense at all\nAnd pimple popped that incident thinking we just defending it\nInternets undefeated and exposing secrets so intimate\nDon't lead too far away into it\nGotta flip with a dismount\nDon't flinch when it gets out\nEverybody, anybody been getting it Krizz for the discount\nBut me and N9NA the payday\nOn the way with Mike and \u00a1MAYDAY!\nThey say us get the boot and shoot\nAnd you believe what they say\nStacks with Dax, we get plaques, y'all relaxing\nRelax, don't make me act black bout that action\nRap class with badass kids and tongue lashing\nGet your fat ass in bed by 10 and quit rapping\nAnd easily could make a nonbeliever say it's so\nIt's a sequel but it's equal to the shit I said before\nIt's okay if you just say what you say, you don't really know\nYou need some proof, you need some proof\nLet Kali Baby say it's so\n\n[Verse 6: Tech N9ne]\nI ain't even gotta say nothin'\n'Cause I stay bussin', never nay bluffin'\nAll you gotta do is hit the play button, I'ma spray glutton\nDon't you worry 'bout the pay cut & who the A. fuckin'\nI'm Va J crushin', but I'm lay hushin'\nRaise up and then I'm way buzzin' when I'm hey puffin', cray clutchin'!\nMan I been given the gift (Ayy)\nAnd I been gettin' the grip (Ayy)\nGrand I be livin' in fantasy vision how can I be missin' the chips (Woop)\nWith no guts, it's no bucks get no plus\nJust go buss wit' no fucks, it goes up!\nI'm sick and tired of this motherfuckin' shit\nYou niggas liars comin' thug and suckin' dick\nAnd then it expires 'cause it wasn't what it spit\nAll your subbin' stuff it quits\nNo more bluffing plug exists! (Ayy)\nTo dominate the industry's been a race (Pyune)\nThey tryna kill me then call it a cold case\nBut wait they cannot close it on Yates\nHe's y'all fate so if you don't open the case\nI'mma unload in your fuckin' face!
