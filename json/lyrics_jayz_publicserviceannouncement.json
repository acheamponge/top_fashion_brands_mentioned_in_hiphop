Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm GONE!\nAnd I don't care WHAT you think about me\u2014but just remember, when it hits the fan, brother, whether it's next year, ten years, twenty years from now, you'll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you JACK!\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nVing ain't lie\nI done came through the block in everything that's fly\nI'm like Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex\nI never claimed to have wings on\nNigga, I get my \"by any means\" on whenever there's a drought\nGet your umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm\nYou can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game\nI just rolled the dice, trying to get some change\nAnd I'd do it twice, ain't no sense in me\nLying as if I am a different man\nAnd I could blame my environment but\nThere ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains\nHope you don't think users are the only abusers\nNiggas getting high within the game\nIf you do then, how would you explain?\nI'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins\nI got a hustler spirit, nigga, period\nCheck out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it\nCheck out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer\nNo matter where you go, you are what you are player\nAnd you can try to change but that's just the top layer\nMan, you was who you was 'fore you got here\nOnly God can judge me, so I'm gone\nEither love me, or leave me alone\n\nNow, back to our regularly scheduled program, L'Album Noir: The Black Album", "title": "Public Service Announcement", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/db98dd9c59a51c9b6b76f6d6a32cac9f.991x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2003-11-14", "album": "The Black Album"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
