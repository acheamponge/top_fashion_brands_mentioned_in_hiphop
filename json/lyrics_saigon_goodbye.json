How could you move on?\nI sit and reminisce as I'm poppin' off beer tops\nQuarter for my memories of all the fallen tear drops\nIt'd be a lie if I told you I couldn't cry\nYou never said goodbye so why shouldn't I\nEven before I fucked ya, I knew that I discovered my wife\nThrough prison and all the strife, you the love of my life\nWhen I was caught up in the mix, you bought my baby sis and brother kicks\nTrusted me even after you busted me with other chicks\nBy you departing, left my shit torn slim\nI 'member flirting with your friends and you be flipping on them\nIn missionary position, I used to feed you my manhood\nI even devoured you cause the power you was so damn good\nThem sad songs had me poppin' off beer tops\nQuarter for my memories of all the fallen tear drops\nI think deep when I recollect on your mindstate\nLately, I contribute to the rising of the crime rate\nAnd roam red\u2014all the sane thoughts in my dome dead\nWas it something I said that made you aim at your own head\nContinue sleeping.  I'm sorry I was wrong for cheating\nI'm in your heart even though its no longer beating\n\n[Outro: Saigon]\nMan, that's some fucked up shit, girl\nYou could've warned me, girl", "album": "All in a Day\u2019s Work"}], "artist": "Saigon"}
