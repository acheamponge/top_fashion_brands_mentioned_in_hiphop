Do I look a mess?\"\nShe said, \"I saw you through the peephole\nWith that pre-roll, chico\", she know\nMy demeanor is calmer\nWhen I smoke as much as I wanna\nI ain't never got no worries\nI ain't really ever got no drama\nI'm a perfect gentleman as I enter into her abode\nReady for whatever unfolds\n\n[Chorus: Krysta Youngs & Wax]\nI like you better when you're high\n'Cause when you're high you never make me cry\nI like you better when you smoke\n'Cause when you smoke you laugh at all my jokes\nI like you better when you're stoned\n'Cause when you're stoned you never bitch and moan\nThere's just so many reasons why (Mmm)\nI like you better when you're high\n\n[Verse 2: Wax]\nHanging out at your house\nWith an ounce in my pouch\nFuck yo couch, fuck yo couch\nWe be fuckin' on your couch\nWhen you bounce like you bounce\nI can see you as my spouse\nGirl, you sound like Minnie Mouse\nWith your little shrilly shouts\nI'm in heaven at your casa, king like Mufasa\nBefore I got to say hasta la vista\nWe feast on some pasta\nLot of women that I been with don't approve of my ways\nBut you different and I think it's amazing\n\n[Bridge: Wax]\nYou dig me when I fly (Fly)\nI'll meet you in the sky (Meet you in the sky)\nWe starin' eye to eye  (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)\nThere's no now or never\nIf I'm ever there with you\n\n[Chorus: Krysta Youngs]\nI like you better when you're high\n'Cause when you're high you never make me cry\nI like you better when you smoke\n'Cause when you smoke you laugh at all my jokes\nI like you better when you're stoned\n'Cause when you're stoned you never bitch and moan\nThere's just so many reasons why\nI like you better when you're high", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cc40ee6013398d8e9ab79150b9ba466f.800x800x1.jpg", "album": "B.A.A.A", "title": "Better When You\u2019re High"}]}
