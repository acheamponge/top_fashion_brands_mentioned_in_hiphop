Stack!\nWent to the dollars with a fistful of dollars\nKnowing nuthin\u2019 about the paperwork\u2026 Bring the car jerk!\nI\u2019m going to the carwash and the club, and I'mma bounce with summin\u2019\nRemember the first time? The first rhyme that made niggas say, \u201cSon! You got summin\u2019!\u201d\nRemember planning the day out, the whole layout\nPrecision every hour, taking that shower?\nClothes already laid out!\nRemember that first time you stayed at a honey crib?\nAnd came home with the sun\u2026\nRemember that son?\nRemember break night, Remember break white?\nRemember you sold in front of the police like it was nuff, remember that?\nIn December that year, remember when you failed to appear to the court?\n\n[Hook]\nDo you remember!?\nWhen we used to play shoot \u2019em up, Bang-Bang?\nShoot \u2018em up, BANG-BANG!\nYou remember!?\nWhen we used to play shoot \u2018em up, Bang-Bang?\nShoot \u2018em up, BANG-BAANG!\n\n[Verse 2]\nDo you remember when the used to have house parties?\nAnd you\u2019d find that girl that was the most in your world?\nAnd for them fine slow jams, y\u2019all got it in!\nRemember your first chain?\nYou\u2019d go out when the store closed\nI\u2019ma kill these hoes!\nRemember boosting clothes?\nSo you was fly on Easter\nPlaying the goose\nRemember when son died? How we all cried\nAnd for his daughter we provide\nRemember Rikers Island on the inside?\nRemember the boat parties we wouldn\u2019t let in?\nYou swore you was winning\nWent home spinning\nRemember Flex first dropped the bomb?\nSummin\u2019 nice on your arm?\nYou didn\u2019t wear the glove, so you made baby love\nRemember that!?\n\n[Hook]", "album": null}], "artist": "Sadat X"}
