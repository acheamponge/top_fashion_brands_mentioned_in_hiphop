Claire cleveland\nThuggin and thievin until a nigga stop breathing\nKeepin me from anything less than a thug\nFloatin on virgins rollin on dubs\nOn the corner when they getting out of pocket my demeanor like a drug dealer thug niggas clockin on the rita\nFrom the bus to the plane to the train to the geta\nKnock it outta the park now taste that parena\nLock jaw fuckin wit a pit\nMiami on the mind wit a tux and a jacket on a split\nFake niggas run real niggas do shit\nThen lie to the cops they ain't do shit\nNigga what we doin get into it so its fluid\nBB in the buildin but the money in the ceilin\nGot the feelin like a nigga finna steal it\nImma move it but the safe inside the wall\nBehind the picture wit the cubans\nIlluminated most of you muthafuckas ain't educated\nConsuming that dumb shit you niggas are aggravating agitated broke than a muthafucka we lattersated actin like a bitch will get you killed and exasperated\n\nItll be the death of them that'll be all gentlemen matter at all tell\n\nFire starter no barter ride on a nigga make a man sleep\n\n[Pre-Hook: Bizzy Bone]\nSleep wit it loaded my Glock locks rolling\nEast double 9 all the time i know you want it\nSleep wit it loaded the Glock i be holdin\nEast double 9 all the time i know you want it\nSleep wit it loaded my Glock locks rolling\nEast double 9 all the time i know you want it\nSleep wit it loaded the Glock lock im holdin\nEast double 9 all the time i know she want it\nI know she want it ,she want it ,she want it\n\n[Chorus: Excel Beats]\nYou came into my dreams\nNow the darkness consumes everything\nMy life will never be the same, no\nIts safe to say, that this pain\nThis pain is all i'll ever know\nAll i'll ever know"}], "artist": "Bizzy Bone"}
