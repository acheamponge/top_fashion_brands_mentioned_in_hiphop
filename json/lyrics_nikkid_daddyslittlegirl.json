No way, no how\nIt'll break his heart, wreck his whole world\nTo have to grow up quick - daddy's little girl\n(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)\nBut I'm daddy's little girl\n\n[ VERSE 3 ]\nNeighbors asked could he trust me, yeah, daddy loves me\nCause I can feel it in his arms strong when he hugs me\nBut there comes a time when his angel must spread her wings\nSo I bow my head and get deep into the swing of things\nSort of raunchy I must be, cause mama knew\nEvery time I skipped school mama sat home and sang the blues\nNow I regret the day that daddy let me out to play\nBut I'm a woman now, so let's keep it this way\nDaddy's little girl\n\n(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)\nBut I'm daddy's little girl"}], "artist": "Nikki D"}
