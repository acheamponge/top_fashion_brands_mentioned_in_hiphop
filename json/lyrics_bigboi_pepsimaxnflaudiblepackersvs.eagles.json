I tip my hat off to the Packers\nStill with all the injuries defense became deciding factor\nFrom the rafters to the goal line, somebody fin' to go home now\nBut will it be the Eagles or the Packers? It's a showdown\nWho wants some?\n\nPepsi Max, zero calories, maximum taste", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6ab5c816aabfeaaf6d9419aff7e1e84c.1000x563x1.jpg", "year": null, "title": "Pepsi MAX NFL Audible - Packers vs. Eagles", "album": null}]}
