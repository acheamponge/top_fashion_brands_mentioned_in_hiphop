used to tell me I was nothing more than worthless\nA stupid motherfucker that would live without a purpose\nPut my thoughts upon a page so I could try and prove him wrong\nAnd every time I write a song I reminisce about the pain that I'm repressing in my brain so I don't ever feel alone\nAnd I've been living with depression so I wonder how this shit really begins\nI'm comfortable with the thoughts of vision and now it is\n\nI've been working on this record for a minute\nStill I feel like nothing that I do is good enough\nMy insecurities are creeping in so they would seep in to the music\nAin't it funny when other people see your pain as amusing?\nAbusing many a pill and numbing the way I feel 'til the point of my reality's the furthest thing from real\nThe only thing I ever needed was a little piece of love and I couldn't find that in people so I would seek it in drugs\nAnd I wanted to be the greatest instead I'm facing the truth\nBut the fact of the matter is that I'm losing it what's the use\nAnd I know I'm sounding repetitive lack the lust for living\nI pray that I be forgiven , I say let\u2019s take a picture\nFor sinners to get the sentiment a critical acclaim to explaining  it wasn't evident\nA premonition of my early death I'll make it prevalent malevolent confessing\nAnd if I was down and out I can't sell my soul to be relevant\nGallivanting around like 'Fuck I'm finally free\nI'm ignoring all of my problems\nI said I'd bury them deep '\nBut I'm actually terrified and my paranoia was verified cause I just realized I don't wanna make it to twenty-five\nA suicidal psychopath, a schizophrenic kinda guy that's looking for your empathy hoping that you'll remember me\nThe message I provided collided within the melody\nA metamorphosism reliving giving debauchery\nThe resurrection of a savior coming out of Nazareth where you could catch a laceration and a crucifixion\nUnder what condition d'you make the decision moving like it's in a mild position living at the bottom wishing I was with it\nCouldn't tell the difference\nSo tired of giving the false opinions\nMy faith in the book that was written by other people\nThey probably wrote with agendas\nSo every role was intended for anyone to follow\nAttention, I got a testament\nJust like the book of Mark\nI'm sparking a revolution\nMy story a revelation\nAmazing, I'd rather save it, debate it\nEverything on my mind\nWhile I was taking a mental picture\nOK, so my train of thought is evasive\nI'm faded within my memory\nFrom a daily addiction of always staying sedated and claiming I wanna make it\nI'm nothing more than a follower\nNo apologies for it\nEnforcing my fucking happiness\nDon't know what I believe and I'm seething and barely breathing\nI was thinking of positivity\nThe possibility that I'll be sane is like a fallacy\nI got a way to go and I'm showing you people gradually\nI been imagining a better life and then I contradict it\nThe consequence of feeling like a loser with no confidence\nAnd I've been all alone, I'm tryna find the source of inner peace\nI suffocate the beat until the flow has been consumed\nI strangulate that mother fucker, turn the tune and turn the night maroon\nAnd if I'm being honest, I think I'm losing my passion\nI'm passing on opportunities\nGiving in to distraction\nThe problem's that I've been having is all of it's a facade\nIt's quantity over quality\nProfit over the product\nBut shit if it makes a dollar\nWho gives a fuck if it's garbage?\nWe'll get it radio play and then now make it a classic\nAnd take a nigga with talent that's about as big as a grain of salt\nAnd put him on a pedestal\nHe'll eventually catapult to perpetual force\nThe actual result distracting\nThey forgot that mother fucker was never decent at rapping\nThey reminisce on the past and there ain't nobody original\nBut niggas stealing styles and never giving their credit\nAccepting that shit's pathetic\nA hypothetical pondering\nI put it on a paper for some people I'm being honest with\nAbolishing a novice and murdering his accomplice\nA complicated affair with the notorious hitter\nThese habitual liars supplying a lot of ignorance\nIt's all about an image, so everyone's irresponsible\nAnd if you got a positive message then it's impossible to overcome the current plan and rap a better obstacle\nIt's illogical to think that\nThe future is looking brighter\nWhen money comes into play than the vision will get distorted\nCause you were forced into feeling by acting out of your character\nYou lost your sense of pride that's inside\nDon't let them embarrass ya\nBarely making it now when you're coming up from the rubble\nRefuse to be in the rut\nAin't no need for an introduction\nMy shit is really disgusting\nIt's different and impeccable\nIntelligent and highly respectable\nYou're susceptible to this lyrical giant\nA tyrant acting defiant\nI'd rather do this alone\nSo mother fuck an alliance aligning with preservation\nTo practice my dedication by defecating the delicate\nRelegated with delegates to give them rigamortis\nSupported within a deficit\nCelebrated a reverence\nTelevising my decadence\nFrom years of destitution\nThe resolution's irrelevant\nIt's gotten to the point where I can see that nothing's real at all\nIt's leaving me appalled and\nI'm embarrassed I will get involved to mental regression for I have yet to evolve\nGot to find a spot to put my aggression before I'm gone\nBut the pain that I feel has lasted so long\nSo by the end of this song I'm praying for my desire cause I'm refusing to fake it\nI\u2019d rather reform than retire so my generation remedial\nI really can't believe this shit is happening\nIn any lie, I\u2019m surrounded by fucking geniuses\nAnd you gotta be kidding me\nThe only thing I was meant to be is the dopest mother fucker that people will probably never see\nAnd if I never make it then I'm fulfilling the prophecy\nEverything that I write has been centered around my honesty"}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
