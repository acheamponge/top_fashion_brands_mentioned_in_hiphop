Yeah, listen, bitch\nHere is bag, get to filling it\nLady moved kind of slow like she forgot the code\nYounger brother watch the clock, \"yo, it's time to go\"\nHe ain't leaving out this door without this pot of gold\nLock and load\n\n[Verse 5]\nThe old owner's down stairs doing invoices\nSeen the power go out, and he could hear noises\nKnew what was taking place and had a little something\nOf his own waiting for this situation\nHe came out bummages to show them what time it is\nThe guns are kind of big, but one ain't ever fired his\nAim ain't confident plus he got the power kick\nHitting all kind of shit except of what the target is\nBut old papa did just the opposite\nShots just ricocheting, \"listen mister, isn't playing\"\nKids made it out the spot, but he followed them\nNines still firing, sirens hollering\nPolice arrive and the younger twin dropped just then\nThe owner hit him in the collar and bodied him\nKemosabe isn't stopping\nContinued throwing shots at the cops until the officers slaughter him\nDamn, now who's suppose to tell grandma and them?", "year": null, "album": "Left In The Deck"}], "artist": "Brother Ali"}
