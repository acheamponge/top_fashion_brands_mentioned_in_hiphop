Blige]\nCome close to me, baby\nLet your love hold you\nI know this world is crazy\nWhat's it without you?\n(Nothing, nothing)\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nPut down your bags love\nI know in the past love\nHas been sort of hard on you\nBut I see the God in you\nI just want to nurture it\nThough this love may hurt a bit\nWe dealing wit this water love\nWe dealing wit this water love\nI want to build a tribe wit you\nProtect and provide for you\nWe dealing wit this water love\nWe dealing wit this water love\nI want to build a tribe wit you\nProtect and provide for you\nWe dealing wit this water love\n\n[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]\nCome close to me, baby\nLet your love hold you\nI know this world is crazy\nWhat's it without you?\n(Nothing, nothing)", "title": "Come Close", "year": "2018-09-28", "album": null}], "artist": "Unknown Artist"}
