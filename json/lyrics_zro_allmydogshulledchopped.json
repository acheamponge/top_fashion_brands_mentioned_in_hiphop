us, in a trunk steady bumping us\nAnd wasn't ever giving up on us, and down to ride when it's time to bust\nLil' Trae fin to spit the real, now what would I be with none of my niggas\nI'd prolly be dead in the mist of guerillas, or stuck in a cell with multiple killers\nYou gotta keep your head up, take your-take your time don't let up\nEven though this life be tough, you gotta be standing strong even though you know the road get rough\nI'm a hundred percent down with y'all, you gotta do what you gotta do\nAs long-as long as you plan on never giving up, the Maab gon forever stay down

creeping off in the land to the end of time\nAK-47 3-57 mack 11 and a mo'fucking sawed off, everybody get hauled off\nTo the cemetery, when a nigga get aggravated\nRunning up in your house with the nickel plated, artillery up in your mouth\nCause I'm a mad man, all of my-all of my dogs are ignant and twisted\nCall me a landlord, cause I tend to make niggas souls get evicted\nMass murder, all of my dogs down with it\nGot a lick for ninety bricks, and yeah my people gon' go hit it\nAll of my people stay on the grind, 24/7 a constant shine\nHPD can eat a dick, cause we guerillas and we above the law\nAin't got no love for y'all, ain't no compassion\n'Cause everytime y'all motherfuckers come to the ghetto, y'all come blast\nThat there-that there why I be masking, and ready to run y'all over\nI'm about stacking my fetti, but feminine niggas feel me cause I'm a soldier\nLike britches I'll fold ya, I done told ya already\nBack-back or the black mack, will touch all y'all belly\n\n[Chorus: Dougie D]\nThis for all of my dogs\nAll of my people, all of my killers, all of my dogs\nAll of my niggas all my gorillas, all of my dogs\nAll of my people, all of my killers, all of my dogs\nAll of my niggas all my gorillas, all of my dogs\nAll of my people, all of my killers, all of my dogs\nAll of my niggas all my gorillas, all of my dogs", "year": null, "image":
