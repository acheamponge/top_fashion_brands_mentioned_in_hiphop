Nope\u2014bed, floor, dope; go for it, couch now\nSlow motion around, put it down\nLord knows she was gone \u2018fore the morn', hold up\n\n[Hook: Tiara Thomas]\nIs it bad that I never made love?\nNo, I never did it\nBut I sure know how to fuck\nI'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya\nI can't promise that I'll be good to ya\n'Cause I had some issues\nI won't commit, no, not havin' it\nBut at least I can admit\nThat I'll be bad, no, to you (to you)\nYeah, I'll be good in bed\nBut I'll be bad to you\n(Yeah, let me tell you 'bout her, look!)\n\n[Verse 2: Wale]\nShe hurt feelings, she break hearts\nShe stay quiet, she play smart\nShe take pride in goin' out\nAnd gettin' hollered at and sayin' nah\nShe no saint, but she don't pose\nShe don't wear make-up by the boatload\nRidin' through lake shore with the nose up\nShe don't really date much, but it slows her up\nShe got haters, but we all do\nHeard you're winter-time cold, shawty, fall through\nBaby, look at they approach, how they court you\nAll those minds games, nevermind, 'cause they all lose\n(Bad, nooo) In the physical sense I mean that\nI ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas\nI ain't like them nigga you suckin' your teeth at, nope\nPlay big, trust me I'll humble yo' mean-ass\nLook, shawty is actually in prevent\n'Cause the one in front of her is workin' with deep threat\nYep\u2014bed, floor, couch, more\nMore, shower, Lord, perm, done\nLove? Nah, called in the morn'\nCell number wasn't on, goddamn!\n\n[Hook: Tiara Thomas]\nIs it bad that I never made love?\nNo, I never did it\nBut I sure know how to fuck\nI'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya\nI can't promise that I'll be good to ya\n'Cause I had some issues\nI won't commit, no, not havin' it\nBut at least I can admit\nThat I'll be bad, no, to you (to you)\nYeah, I'll be good in bed\nBut I'll be bad to you\nBad that I never made love\nNo, I never did it\nBut I sure know how to fuck\n\n[Produced by Kelson and Tiara Thomas]", "album": "Folarin", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/3ddeb5c4bb4ca99b8c5672ad5ff9c78d.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
