{"songs": [{"title": "Dreams Are...", "lyrics": "The words it's impossible and I can't\nShould never be uttered because they just aren't\nTrue, we just gotta' let go\nWhoever saw the baby that said it couldn't grow\nOr the river that said it couldn't flow\nGet in and have a go\nCome along have a role\nBut it seems we sow only seeds of doubt\nJust in our head yet we can't pick them out\nAnd what do the sprout? Fear and arrogance\nSame thing \u2026 do with extravagance\nFeel better or worse, than anyone here\nEither way still the cause is fear\nI am the enemy and I'm the ally\nPast the pauper and the Prince now can I\nSee I'm the cause and the source of the greed\nAll I ever think is me, me, me\nMy Ambition, My life, My belly\nMy radio, My car, My telly\nMy meditation, My hurt\nMy Temple, My Mosque, My Church\nLook now at my technology\nBut I can't make a blade of grass\nOh, no please reassure\nMe the somehow I am more\nThat is the crutch that I need for my balance\nComparisons how I define my talents\nConquer the World with my sword, my falace\nDecorate my cotch', make it look like a palace\nA cage may be golden, still a cage\nWhat do I mean? Let me explain\nDivisions of race and class in these prisons\nMake us feel better, but it ain\u2019t really living\nKinda' like aspirin the numbs the pain\nBut don't deal with the cause\nSo nothing ever change\nI still feel empty, I still feel envy\nHaving nothing though, I steal plenty\nThose we applaud and laud as our gentry\nLook back through the course of the centuries\nCall it history\nBother to record it\nBut all it is, is the wars that we thought in\nWho we have hated and stripped naked\nWhich places, enslavement\nDraw on a pavement, call it a nation, give us a flag\nWhat happened to the way you\nSplit us into factions, factions, captions\nGive us a distraction\nLights, Camera, Action\nGive me an Oscar\nNow I'm important\nMore than a Doctor\nYou know the circus, make you're self worthless\nTV makes us more than a person\nGive me a badge, I'm an authority\nAnd I have the right to protect property\nBut not people, that's far too dangerous\nWhat happens to privilege, if their the same as us\nBut the real question that puzzles philosophers\nIs there another way that we don't feel shit\nOr is this it?\nJust a bunch of misfits\nFor what it's worth, here's my two p\nI think the worlds perfect, life is brilliant\nThe only thing wrong, is our own ignorance\nCan't describe the beauty, the mystery\nDon't subscribe to beauty, that is misery\nHard is for us, it's what\u2019s obvious\nIt's obvious were independent, but that don't bother us\nObvious\nWe keep killing\nNo matter what nature keeps giving\nThings keep growing and the earth keeps spinning\nWhat don't compete is the only thing winning\nObvious that men are intermediated by women\nBut it's obvious that women have greater power within em'\nWith that said it's two sides of a coin\nYing and the Yang like twins conjoined\nIt's obvious people can't create wealth\nOnly thing we destroy is ourself\nAnd the self is the hardest thing to believe in\nIt's obvious to see that they keep deceiving\nObvious that we live lives with no meaning\nObvious that we forgot to keep dreaming\nLike we did when kids went playing\nThat is the truth, forget what I'm saying\nSo dream\nBut don't dream for more cash\nDream for the vision to see that your rich\nDon't dare dream for a better tomorrow\nDream in the moment, or it's just hollow\nDream for whatever, Dream to be clever\nDream, Dream Jimmy and Bob made an album together\nDream for whatever, Dream to be clever\nDream, Dream Jimmy and Bob made an album together\nDreams are just dreams when we dream together\nDream Jimmy and Bob made an album together\nDream forever", "year": null, "album": "Knowledge Is Power Vol. 1", "image": "https://images.genius.com/95f4dbc07c7455e0bbf14b55f99cc7a0.918x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
