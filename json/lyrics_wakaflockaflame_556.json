dead last\nI told you O, Let's Do It and then we sped past\n\n[Beat Switch]\n\n[Verse 2]\nShow me where the king, point him out\nOne day we're gon' meet and I'ma see what you about\nI keep a few pistols tucked in my accounts\nPlenty henny and a blunt in my mouth\nGet the fuck out of my house\nRappers say sophisticated shit to sound clever\nWhen it come to business, I handle mine better\nBut I handle my sweater, I'm revealing my pistol\nI'ma hit him with a missile\nGrim reaper gon' kiss him\nAin't nobody gon' miss him, just another dead rapper\nMan [?] drinking lean, he a fake trapper\nRich dope fiends, how the fuck you get famous\nWe from the jungle, can't blame us or tame us\nI'm cold to the sinless, your heinous\nI'm the nicest definest, and the rhymes all timeless\n\n[Beat Switch]\n\n[Verse 3]\nA lot of rapper wafted me\nAnd gradually, I had to be\nBetter than every rapper, these critics be naming after me\nI'm a savage doing damage, if hes after me\nFuck yo salary, you get catastrophe, I'll blast you to reality\nYou can't fuck with me, or push your luck with me\nI kicked you out of the public, you just a sitting duck to me\nNow suddenly, I let that heat out like a oven b money tree\nSo I got a green thumb, I kinda love my theme song\n\n[Beat Switch]\n\n[Verse 3]\nRapping's full of metaphors, but they don't really love themselves\nPass the mic, your hermaphrodite, and go and fuck yourselves\nI feel like Biggie in a tunnel, without 100 Brooklyn niggas\nI stay away from crooked niggas, sideways looking niggas\nTaylor's gettin' prayed, but what they say on social media\nYou don't really know me, your just reading Wikipedia\nPull up at yo front door, take the [?]\nSlap the holy ghost, I let anyone agree with ya\nI feel like Nas 01, this my Ether\nYou rappers couldn't make it with a Jay-Z feature\nWe way deeper, you pay people to slay people\nInstead of change, we blade evil to hate people\nMy people, black, white and brown people\nFuck skin tone, cuz we all equal\nI'm just tryna teach you\nAnd if my hands can't do it, let me voice reach you\nThey say the people need you\n\n[Beat Switch]\n\n[Verse 4]\nLook at Waka putting them all good words together\nThem old fans checking back, like they heard me better\nHe was playing with this rap shit the whole time\nI was geeked up, freestyling in my old rhymes\nBack in 09, now I'm taking my time\nElevating my mind, I got the game in my palms\nSay As-salamu alaykum, Wa alaykumu salam\nArm, leg, leg on head, lets break bread\nAll I need is proper sentence, spent the winter in Queens\nRealize that I'm living my dream\nKeep going, that's a river-dale thing\nOne thing I won't do is let my feet fail me\nKeep prevailing\nShit, keep selling\nLet's go!\n\n[Beat Switch]\n\n[Verse 5]\nYou got no fucking clue what I've been through\nLearn to never get in shark water that I swim through\nThey say guns kill people, that defends you\nKinda fucked up, the type of shit that your friends do\nIts fucking with my mental, it used to be simple\nWhen I'm done with you, they I.D. you by ya dentals\nAnd that's the end y'all, muthafuckin be all\nI holla out that b card, my boss will come see ya\nI could never be ya, yall bout knee tall\nBetter hope I never meet ya, I have to teach ya\nAnd when I'm dead, bury me 5 feet\nMy team elite, treat every man equally\nCuz we all kings with billion dollar dreams\nWAKA FLOCKA\n\n[Beat Switch]\n\n[Verse 6]\nHere comes the brand new Flocka in yo ears\nPut the gun down, no choppa in the air\nYou gotta think deeper, and believe is one\nPeople gotta work for ya money, ain't nobody gon' feed ya\nA new page need a turn, need to save what we earn\nYou could save every day, or live a little while you learn\nNo divisions, support family business if\nWe all came together, shit is all limitless\n\n[Beat Switch]\n\n[Verse 7]\nI ain't gotta fucking flex, been around these streets\nBeen a man my G, now its time to mainstream\nI just made a 100 bands, for a show in UStream\nPrince of the fucking south, my fourth album call me king\nI'm married to the streets, you niggas just had a fling\nI live the shit that I speak, you niggas just sipping lean\nPopping pills, looking sick in talking fiction\nI'm different, I'm on my mission, got visits off getting richer\nRapping 4 years, could have been in college\nFuck the industry, I'm in the streets, the energy acknowledged\nI pull up looking polished\nMy whip ain't got no mileage\nMy work turn bitches gay\nMan I'm like this shit okay\nGod took me out the hood, threw me on stage\nMy heart was full of pain, anger and full off rage\nGetting high hills, blowin that stiletto\nI keep to myself, watch you puppets get Geppetto'd\nI'm my own Captain keep it Brackin' for the ghetto\nWe see who y'all trust, when the fucking dust settle\nRevolutionary rebel, [?]\n5 rings like thee Olympic necks full of gold medals\nWoah!", "image":
