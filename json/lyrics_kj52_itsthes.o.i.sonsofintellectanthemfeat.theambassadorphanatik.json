Yo, stop the blasphemies\nI'm going to battle steady charging like some batteries\nGraduate, first class, Cross Movement academies\nPhanatik, Ambassador, to stimulate your faculties\n[?] laced up like Parry C's\nYou getting on probably running with the Pharisees\nLaying with the dogs, and you waking with the fleas\n52 spitting words, deep like Pacific seas\nI verbalize full circle, 360\u00b0\nDust be getting shocked, the heaven's mentalities\nLyrical missionary threaten the bias, match these\nTriple trinity that reigns now throughout the seas\nOverweight lyrics might call for arteries\nBut your hypocrisies will become your casualties\nSo, smoking threes had at least fatalities\nI'm waiting for the day the whole world comes to His knees\nHoping with the Movement 240s not His steez\nSo underfed emcees, come and get your calories\n\n[Hook]"}]}
