Things have been happening}\nYeah yeah yeah yeah\nYou always talk that things have been happening stuff\nYou know what I'm saying\nI want thinks to be happening between me and you\nYou know mean\n{Oh everything's cool and everything, but I don't know}\n{I don't know, I just don't know}\nYo, I don't have time for that I don't know stuff\nYou know what I'm saying, I'm ready to do this now\nYou know mean\nI'm a man who's used to not settling down with one girl you know but\nYo, like for real I'm break myself down you know I want you to be with me\nYou know what I'm saying\n\n[Verse 2: Kardinal Offishall]\nYo, first things first\nI Kardinal seems to always find a way\nTo strip my soul of a bad man's status\nThe phone apparatus seems to be my killer\nBefore the soundwaves slices my heart all of my insides tenses\nAll of my senses telling me the next flex\nCause my Madmoizellez, tone suggest I am alone\nMadmoizelle have a different face, different body same character\nBecause it lives within the nature, that's why it's natu-ral to the Offishall\nThat I should live for the time, so that I won't lose my mind\nWord up\nTo give you artificial, hoping futuristic dreams about a never-ending team\nWhat the fail to neglect, is that in retrospect\nWhy they take a piece of you, what you receiving isn't true (word up)\nHow many times you hear that I'm gonna, we're gonna\nCheck it, just get to steppin' cause you're damaging my reppin'\nMy best friend's suppose to be my ace\nWhen both of we is genuine, then I might let you shine Madmoizelle\nMy best friend's suppose to by my ace\nWhen both of we is genuine, then I might let you shine Madmoizelle\n\n[Chorus: Wade O. Brown]\nBaby when I know\nI know how to leave Madmoizelle\nI will put you on as well\nThere's no fronting, all of we can do\nI know you can be my Madmoizelle\nI was with you on as well\nThere's no stopping all of we can do\n\n[Verse 2: Kardinal Offishall]\nI was lead to believe that both of we would be\nIn the same vicinity, for infinity\nCheck the lyricy, talks of walking, sexin' in parks after dark\nTurn to private relation, for word sensation\nDreams of my seed having you there to raise him right\nAnd while he's sleeping, I can bust a lyric to your heart heating\nI bear with...\nBut those weren't suppose to be an option\nAfter crossing lines of manhood, tears we both feared\nBut I knew I wasn't gonna, as long as I had you in my corner\nBut then you as a friend started to disappear\nI couldn't hear what you was saying\nJust, the Madmoizelle's face displaying\nEnough young, but old enough to know the best is incomprehendable\nThe grasp of life you possess, if you taught me something\nIt was to be solo on the search, you should be attached to no one\nAmbilicals was cut at birth, Madmoizelle\n\n[Chorus: Wade O. Brown]\nBaby when I know\nI know how to leave Madmoizelle\nI will put you on as well\nThere's no fronting, all of we can do\nI know you can be my Madmoizelle\nI was with you on as well\nThere's no stopping all of we can do\n\n[Verse 3: Kardinal Offishall]\nWhere you were carasseing me, emotionally undressing me\nI couldn't wait for the next session and counting blessings\nNow that you were part of life, living through dramas wasn't nothin'\nNo fronting, your aspiration let me know that you were something\nA mind's travel to distance places, on top of mountains\nTouching the sky together through different climates and weather\nBut this was all reduced to a verbal seduce\nWhen I was introduced to past, all that going too fast isht\nOnce bitten, twice shy, once written Eye & I\nSeen many doves cry but I never heard you lie\nStill the one thing that scares me is that you're true\nAlthough it's ripping me apart, can't go back and stop supporting you\nBreddrens for life, nobody else could share your title\nBesides God, money and Mom, it's in you that I see you knight\nLooking in your eyes is poof, with powers of bud\nIt's a wonder that we never made love\n\n[Chorus: Wade O. Brown]\nBaby when I know\nI know how to leave Madmoizelle\nI will put you on as well\nThere's no fronting, all of we can do\nI know you can be my Madmoizelle\nI was with you on as well\nThere's no stopping all of we can do"}], "artist": "Kardinal Offishall"}
