Some of the Indians turf\nThe Beauty that once flowed from the Nile\nLike the Moses child\nThe hand that writes is a good as the hand that holds the plow\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Killah Priest]\nSome say the spirit of a dead angel lies within me\nLook in my eyes, they're empty\nPoverty stricken beaten with the rod of envy\nLurking through the shadows of death\nDragging my wings, saw the image of a beast\nRam, dragon and queen, heard the bragging of kings\nWhose laughter was as bitter as a scorpion sting\nForced in the ring with idiots so many cliques\nLetting out automatic clips\nA dead lady combing the hair of a bastard bitch\nI spit graphic shit you ain't hear half of it\nFrom my fucked up marriages\nTo dealing with miscarriages\nFrom drinking with savages\nDriving hazardous\nI'm here today to meet the man from Nazareth\nWhere's the pastor? Show me where that chapter is\n\n[Chorus 2x]"}]}
