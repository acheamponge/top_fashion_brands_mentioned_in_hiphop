{"songs": [{"title": "Roll With The Punches", "lyrics": "Roll with the punches is what I tell\nTo people when things dont go too well\nWhen you go for the gold and come back empty\nWhen the ups are few and the downs are plenty\nWhen you talk with the girl that you always desired\nYou busted a move but the move backfired\nWhen life puts you in the little crunches\nDont give up, you've got to roll with the punches\nRoll it baby\n\nWork, no matter what occupation\nAny time's good time for vacation\nEveryday's the same you can't believe the monotony\nSo when the weekend comes its like you had a lobotomy\nYou can't do a thing without the boss start yellin'\nIt wouldn't be bad if his breath wasn't smellin'\nA good day's work for a good day's pay\nBut that's before Uncle Sam takes a portion away\nNow a lot of times you feel just like quittin'\nBut without a job you're home alone sittin'\nCheckin' the want ads for jobs to fill\nWatchin soaps, Geraldo and Oprah, and Phil\nMy advice is to roll with with it honey\nAnd soon you'll find that you'll be in the money\nExpense accounts and three martini lunches\nAnd thats what you get when you roll with the Punches\nRoll it baby\n\nYou got to roll with the punches\nRoll with it\nRoll it baby\n\nLotto, take your chance for a dollar\nIf I win then I'll scream and holler\nHigh on the hog is the way to be\nAnd it's def livin in the lap of luxury\nI picked 4 numbers they were all okay\nFor the 5th and 6th I used my birthday\nBut I erased my birthday and said better yet\nI'll use the birthday of a girlie that I just met\nI filled out the ticket gave it a kiss for luck\nHanded it to the agent with a brand new buck\nWent home to watch TV on a Saturday night\n4 numbers came up and they were all alrright\nNow what happened next, nearly made me drop dead\nIt wasn't her birthday it was mine instead\nI said next time I'll just play my hunches\nBut what the heck, I'll just roll with the punches\nRoll with it\n\nYou got to go with the flow\nLike this\n\nWomen, let me tell you about 'em\nCan't live with them, can't live without em\nThe ones you like only seem to hate you\nThe ones you hate only seem to date you\nGirls will often tell you, you come on too strong\nYou got to take it slow to make the love last long\nBut I say, the early bird catches the worm\nThe late bird gets the gilrie with the two dollar perm\nMan, that put me in dilema\nCase in point a fly girl name Gema\nI met this lady at a quiet place\nAbout 5 years ago we were face to face\nI stepped up to her, tossed the first line\nLike fishin' I was wishin' that the girl would be mine\nI told my best jokes and she started smilin'\nA voice inside said yo Young you're stylin'\nBut then Gema really startin actin' silly\nCuz she broke up with her boyfriend Billy\nShe wanted advice and she was coming to me\nI said you need Dear Abby not the Young MC\nBecause I don't mind being a shoulder to cry on\nBut I need one who needs a body to lie on\n'Cause nowadays I got girls by the bunches\nSee I got smart and just rolled with the punches\nRoll it baby\n\nYou got to go with the flow\nRoll it baby\nNowadays I got girls by the bunches\nI got smart and just rolled with the punches", "album": "Stone Cold Rhymin\u2019", "year": "1989-09-05", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7e9ff08751b8e32d468ac9e4127b8bec.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young MC"}
