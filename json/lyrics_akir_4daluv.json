YG - \u201c4DALUV\u201d\n[Emcee(s): AKIR and YG]\n[Producer(s): [?]]\n\n[Intro: AKIR and YG]\nAKIR: Yeah, this goes out to all my emcees out there keeping it real.  But when you get a record deal, it seems like keeping it real might even be keeping it wrong.  In this fucked up world we live in.  Yo\nYG: Whoo!  Come on.  One Enterprise on the rise.  They don\u2019t understand, man.  These niggas don\u2019t even know.  AKIR and YG.  Yeah, it\u2019s classics, baby.  Yeah, yeah\n\n[Hook: AKIR]\nI do it for the love, man.  Not for the fame\nNot for the chicks, the whips, or the change\nNot for the two-ways to flip or the Range.  Yeah\nI want to get paid, but I do it for the stage\nI do it for the love, man.  Not for the fame\nNot for the chips, the six, or the name\nNot for the video flicks or accolades.  Yeah\nI want to get paid, but I do it for the stage\n\n[Verse 1: YG]\nHeartbeat of\nThe streets\u2014feel the energy\u2014it\u2019s therapeutic\nEverybody got to hustle, but I\u2019m used to it\nSleepwalking through the system, now we all victims\nOf greed, money, and lust.  What happened to us?\nOnce a family that stuck together.  Torn apart \u2018cause\nNowadays, it\u2019s all about the cheddar, the chrome, twenty-inch\nRims, the Lex, Beemer, the Benz, [?]\nWhen will it end, man?  Live from the block, you see them\nNiggas making ends, selling poison to their neighbors\nAnd friends, doing well, moving up the chain.  They got\nFly whips and things, a house on the hill, but still\nSell poison in the block, still trying to kill\n\n[Hook: AKIR]\nI do it for the love, man.  Not for the fame\nNot for the chicks, the whips, or the change\nNot for the two-ways to flip or the Range.  Yeah\nI want to get paid, but I do it for the stage\nI do it for the love, man.  Not for the fame\nNot for the chips, the six, or the name\nNot for the video flicks or accolades.  Yeah\nI want to get paid, but I do it for the stage\n\n[Verse 2: AKIR]\nAin\u2019t shit gon\u2019 change except my chains\nForgets my chain, never gets those chains\nRespect my age and accept my wage through the\nRoads we\u2019ve paved.  No, we won\u2019t be slaves\nHelp my homie so we won\u2019t be slinging.  For your\nOwn peace, say what\u2019s real, for Pete\u2019s sakes\nRoll grass while in the dirt to see snakes.  Don\u2019t\nHold back, say what you feel like handshake.  From the\nDef Jam, whenever you can, have you read, man?\nThere\u2019s no limit to the gifted mind.  You master\nYour P\u2019s and Q\u2019s.  Boy, you\u2019re bad and it\u2019s big news\nFellows rock to your tunes, chicks roll J\u2019s, mimic-\n-ing the words that you say \u2018cause it play all day\nRadio airplay, windows, and hallways\nIt\u2019s time that we rocked \u2018til the time stopped.  Live\nFrom the block, it\u2019s hot like rock on a wild block\nSo don\u2019t stop the art just \u2018cause you climbed the chart\nReach inside the part that\u2019s deep inside your heart\nMake a beat that made you hungry to eat, that made you\nExcited, ignited while you out on the street, that made you\nScared to rip, that made you proud to spit a blessing\nSent to all the people.  Your God\u2019s giving gift\n\n[Interlude 1: AKIR and YG]\nAKIR: Your God\u2019s giving gift.  Yeah.  To all my emcees out there\nYG: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayyo\n\n[Hook: AKIR]\nI do it for the love, man.  Not for the fame\nNot for the chicks, the whips, or the change\nNot for the two-ways to flip or the Range.  Yeah\nI want to get paid, but I do it for the stage\nI do it for the love, man.  Not for the fame\nNot for the chips, the six, or the name\nNot for the video flicks or accolades.
