Might as well spit in my food\nBitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool\nWent from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news\nI started speakin' my mind and tripled my views\nReal bitch, only thing fake is the boobs\nGet money, go hard, you're mothafuckin' right\nNever been a fraud in my mothafuckin' life\nGet money, go hard, damn fuckin' right\nStunting on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite\nAin't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory\nI ain't tellin' y'all to do it, I'm just tellin' my story\nI don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny\nAnd I got enough bras, y'all ain't gotta support me\nI went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga\nOnly person in my fam to see six figures\nThe pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders\nWhen you gotta make sure that everybody straight\nBitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face\nTalking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case\nI waited my whole life just to shit on niggas\nClimbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas\nSaid \"I was just tryna chill and make bangers\" (Bangers)\nTell all these old bitches they in danger (Stop)\nThe thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (Brrrt)\nThat's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer\nYou gon' run up on who and do what? (Who?)\nI think y'all got your story screwed up (Yeah)\nI came here to ball, is you nuts?\nI don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough (Facts)\nI'm the one that's killin' shit, hands down (Hands down)\nIf you got a problem with me, say it now (Say it)\n'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissin' (Huh?)\n'Specially not from one you weak bitches\nI'm on go like I don't see no stop lights (Skrrt)\nI'm steppin' out every day, prom night (Facts)\nSo if it's all love, show me love then (Huh?)\n'Cause you hatin' on a bitch, that's what it sounds like\nBeast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga\nHoodie, low, that's how I'm pullin' up\nJust 'cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run\nAnd you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun (Brrrt, woo)\nAnd we all know you ain't that type (No)\nI smack you and the bitch that you act like (Yeah)\nI started gettin' money, bitches upset (Cash)\nThey remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight\nNails done, hair laid, keep 'em both laced (Laced)\nCo-come through shinin' with a Rollie bust face (Shine)\nHe-headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case\nAin't no bitch spittin' like this since '08\nI don't trust no nigga, I don't fear no bitch (Fear no bitch)\nWhole life been through some fucked up shit (Fucked up shit)\nThey say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this\nWhen you see what I've seen, you end up like this (Woo)\nI walked into the label, \"Where the check at?\" (\"Where the check?\")\nCardi B on the charts, ain't expect that\nWhere that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? (Where?)\nI'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at\nThey say I'm too ratchet, they say I act wild (I act wild, wild)\nI'm tryna whip the foreign like a bad ass child (Bad ass child, skrrt)\nThey caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now (Try that now)\nCardi B, know it's me, hear that \"blap\" sound (Blap!)\n\n[Chorus]\nMan, I said we gon' win\nKnock me down nine times but I get up ten\nLook myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win\nKnock me down nine times but I get up ten\nLook myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win\nKnock me down nine times but I get up ten\nYeah, but I get up ten\nKnock me down nine times but I get up ten, bitch (woo)\n\n[Bridge]\nI'ma make a fuck nigga feel me (yeah)\nSaid I'ma do a broke bitch filthy (ah)\nI'ma make a fuck nigga feel me (grrr)\nSaid I'ma do a broke bitch filthy (grrr)\n\n[Chorus]\nWe gon' win\nKnock me down nine times but I get up ten (woo)\nYeah, I said we gon' win\nKnock me down nine times but I get up ten, bitch (grrr)"}]}
