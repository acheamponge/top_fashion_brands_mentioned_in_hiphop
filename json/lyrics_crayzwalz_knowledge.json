I don\u2019t\nKnow.  I\u2019m just a local kid from the East.  I don\u2019t\nKnow, but I don\u2019t want to do my thing if I\u2019ll\nBe stuck in the bing.  I don\u2019t know.  I don\u2019t\nKnow how I\u2019m supposed to live in the streets.  I don\u2019t\nKnow.  I\u2019m just a vocal kid from the East.  I don\u2019t\nKnow, but I don\u2019t want to do my thing if I\u2019ll\nBe stuck in the bing.  I don\u2019t know.  I don\u2019t\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nIt all started with that metro card\u2014damn!\nWhy my moms ain\u2019t let me use that metro card?  Unlimited\nScars.  What I spit on bars bone-chill.  She said\n\u201cNo\u201d to me\u2014what?!?  I just paid the phone bills.  My stone-\n-willed ego screamed, \u201cYou broke?  Do a robbery\u201d\nMy guardian said, \u201cYou\u2019ll let locked up probably\u201d\nWith anger in my heart, I retorted, \u201cDon\u2019t bother me,\u201d and\nContinued to \u201cDeal in the Now\u201d constantly\nI hopped the train.  Flame on my brain, I see my target\nAvirex leather, platinum chains, fat pockets\nI punched him in his face.  Blood dripped on my cloth, kid\nThinking to myself, I\u2019m like, \u201cDamn, I\u2019m beyond this\u201d\nBut, regardless, I gotta finish what I started\nI drugged him with punches like a knuckle narcotic\nI heard the gun click right before I seen the sparks spit\nThe bullet ricocheted.  I\u2019m like, \u201cDamn, this is a knock home\u201d (Oh shit)\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nI didn\u2019t\nKnow how I\u2019m supposed to live in the streets.  I didn\u2019t\nKnow.  That day, I could have killed police.  I didn\u2019t\nKnow.  Now how I\u2019m supposed to do my thing?  If I\u2019m\nStuck in the bing?  I didn\u2019t know.  I didn\u2019t\nKnow how I\u2019m supposed to live in the streets.  I didn\u2019t\nKnow.  That day, I could have killed police.  I didn\u2019t\nKnow.  Now how I\u2019m supposed to do my thing?  If I\u2019m\nStuck in the bing?  I didn\u2019t know.  I didn\u2019t\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nWith a swift arm twist, I let a shot up in his heart kit\nBy mistake, I reacted to a flashback of bondage\nI heard the radio, started my sprint like a runaway\nSlave in a maze.  Because of this, I might be\nUsing the walls to count days/daze\u2014confusion\nLeft me choosing the wrong ways.  I feel\nLike Kunta.  Pounce on my tail, there\u2019s drama, god\nCops chasing me and jails is packed like Amistad.  I don\u2019t\nWanna manifest Allah through bars (Nah) or dress in\nGreen that ain\u2019t fatigue, and I\u2019m used to \u201cCamouflage\u201d\nClaustrophobic, I\u2019ll go crazy in my cell.  Fuck\nRhyming.  I\u2019ll roll acapell in that hell.  Instead\nOf stoges, I\u2019ll ignite my soul and write\nLike Mumia: \u201cLive from Death Row.\u201d  I\u2019ll feel\nLightning blows from nightsticks, a crowd of chokeholds\nBlack boots massage my limbs\u2014ten in a row.  I could\nSee it now: murder-page face, I\u2019ll be famous.  In the\nPrecinct, they beat me like Larry Davis.  The cop\nDied.  I see my moms cry in my mind.  Threw my\nWatch against the wall \u2018cause now Amadou/I\u2019ma do time.  I know\nJustice.  The judge ain\u2019t got to speak fate.  Damn\nI should have stayed home and wrote rhymes to that beat tape\nI could have been paid with fame from lyrical flame.  Now I\u2019m\nSlave, using the walls to count days\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nNow I\nKnow everything is real in the streets.  Now I\nKnow.  That day, I killed police.  Now I\nKnow I\u2019m never gonna do my thing, forever\nStuck in the bing.  Now I know.  Now I\nKnow everything is real in the streets.  Now I\nKnow \u2018cause, that day, I killed police.  Now I\nKnow I\u2019m never gonna do my thing, forever\nStuck in the bing.  I didn\u2019t know.  Now I\nKnow\n\n[Outro (Overlapped with Verse Adlibs): C-Rayz Walz]\nKnowledge.
