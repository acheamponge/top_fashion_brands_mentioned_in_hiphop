Cause mommy thought it was too late\nThe struggle in her flesh got her mixed up just like a Clue tape\nShe straddling the fence switching back and forth just like two lanes\nSo we present the grace that's available since this Jew came\nWhy did we do it?\nCause we deny the hand that was given\nWe'd rather prison before we choose the Lamb that is risen\nWe're unaware that our hearts are deceitfully wicked\nIf trusted it'll trick you like Shai Linne when he flipped it\nSo don't come up in the game tip toein'\nDip low when we blowin'\nTip slow and chill upon the fact men\nGoin' through notions still jokin' imploding'\nThey lookin' up to God for props and more dollars\nFor collars for poppin, but it on a move\nYo crosses, cause lost men seek flossing like bosses\nIt's 116 the only reason I live\nMake it plain like window panes and outfits without appeal\nYes I am young but like Vince I rally\nI'm unashamed I stand out like Longhorns in Cali\n\n[Chorus-Tedashii & Trip Lee:]\nBecause of God's love and grace - that's why we did what we did\nFor little kids up in the faith - that's why we did what we did\nHis Son died up in our place - that's why we did what we did\nTo meet the Father face to face - that's why we did what we did\nTo show them boys it's not an act - that's why we did what we did\nBecause the Christ is comin back - that's why we did what we did\nTo rep His name and hold it down - that's why we did what we did\nWe grab mikes and say it loud - that's why we did what we did\n\n[Verse 2-Trip Lee]\nHey!\nCats always wanna ask us why we made a switch to livin life for the Master\nAin't nothing great as this\nWe don't be feelin like we have to be smoking and drinking Cris\nThey don't understand so they be asking why like Jadakiss\nWe used to be your average dudes man livin' just to live with ungodly attitudes\nStraight content within our sin\nBut glory to God He snatched us up out of confusion, we ain't fools cause Christ cross shook us like we was hoopin' man\nWe ain't even know that our vision was blurred, was all up in the world but wouldn't get in the word\nYou wonder why we dirty south but ain't sippin' the syrup, cause He took the crucifixion still was risen on the third\nHis Spirit took control that's why we some new creatures\nTaught us everything we know like He was a school teacher\nNow we pursue Jesus we ain't livin' in sin, cuz He snatched us out the pit that's why we did what we did\n\n[Repeat Chorus:]\n\n[Verse 3-Tedashii]\nHey it's T-Dot, I'm back on your corner up in your hood man\nStill reaching for them junky monkeys grippin the wood grain\nStill reaching out to my family just like I should man\nEven if they blow me off with it it's all good man\nCause the truth of the gospel I got it\nJust like apostles I shout it\nLoud like little kids who be pouting\nTill this whole circle get crowded\nSee the world is undoubtedly cursed with a curse\nSo we spit a verse with no curse for the reverse of the curse\nChildren are fighting to live, addicts keep popping them pills, Christians are frightened to spill, passively croppin' them fields\nI'm unashamed of the God who would take my blame, the lashes on the Master passed me fastly when Jesus came\nSo reading His Word- that's me, witness on curbs- that's me, no four letter words- that's me, does this sound absurd? That's me\nSee through what Jesus did, now we some believer kids, see it's His love that compels us to do what we did\n\n(Repeat chorus)"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
