But this is gonna cost 'em\nI walk in the sneaker store\nMy ass is about to get raw\nLook at my watch it's a quarter past four\nMy mind's blank, flipping, shitting\nThis the dead zone\nI see this Spanish kid listening to reggae on his headphones\nI grabbed him, snatched him backwards\nSmacked him, he tried to react, it's when I was tempted to put a cap in him\nBut I didn't, I figured it was best if he was living\nPulled the SIG out everyone inside the store started shitting\nI made everybody in the spot get down on they fours\nI made a 300 pound woman strip down to her drawers\nIt was sickening, I couldn't believe what I was doing\nMy life is ruined at the age of 22\nAnd it's for real, trying to find the spot the safe is\nCannot escape this, I'm scared to be in jail with all the rapists\nI tried to rule the world but I blew it\nI gave the fat naked bitch the gun to kill me, she wouldn't do it\nSo I took the gun back and beat her down\nI gotta find a place to creep now (I gotta be out)\nYo, yo\nThis where my shit stops\nI turned around, surrounded by six cops\nPut the clip in my SIG, got six shots\nThey made my skull almost cave in for misbehaving\nIt's cause I chickened out and threw the gun down and gave in\nI had no respect on the outside\nBut now I got less respect on the inside (inside)\nI tried to rule the world but I blew it\nWishing I was dead but I still don't got the guts to do it\n\n[Hook x6]", "title": "Smithhaven Mall", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6c5a71cd1b560bcf519adbe42cf4f4ff.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
