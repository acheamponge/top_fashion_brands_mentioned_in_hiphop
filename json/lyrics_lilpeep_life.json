I think that life is beautiful\nTryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral\nFindin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual\nYou were not invited 'cause you're nothin' like the usual\nIsn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful\nYou wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital\nDoctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal\nTumor in your brain and they say that it's inoperable\nIsn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful\nThey'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal\nThey'll fuckin' kill you too, so you better not get physical\nWelcome to America, that type of shit is typical\nIsn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful\n\n[Verse 2]\nWake up in the mornin', now you doin' the impossible\nFind out what's important, now you feelin' philosophical\nWhen I die I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable\nIsn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible\nYou think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable\nYou think you can do it, but your chances are improbable\nOnce you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle\nIsn't life comical? I think that life is comical\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd if you ever need a friend then you got me\nAnd in the end, when I die, would you watch me?\nAnd if I tried suicide, would you stop me?\nWould you help me get a grip or would you drop me?\nRunaway, make friends with the moon\nWhy you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon\nThere comes a time when everybody meets the same fate\nI think I'ma die alone inside my room"}], "artist": "Lil Peep"}
