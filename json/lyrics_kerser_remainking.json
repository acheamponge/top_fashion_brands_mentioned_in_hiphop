(fuck)\n'Cause my tax bill bigger than your yearly wage\nI'm the lad still sipping on the clearest day\nI'm the hash pill pimping like I'm here to stay\nI'm the rash, got you itching 'cause you feel my pain\nI make your head explode with just one of my rhymes\nI'm like Andrew Johns on drugs in my prime\nI'm like Mike eighteen round one when Pac died\nTo say I've got an attitude, you ain't even seen my dark side\nKers one, I ain't ever had to lay low\nBut you's did once Shoey fucking came home\nWe stay real with the crew till the end\nFuck your peace 'cause here we've got unity man and\n\n[Hook]\nThey see me shine, they see me win\nIt hurts their pride, I laugh inside\nAnd they still whine 'cause I'm the kind to remain King\nI run this scene\nThey see me shine, they see me win\nIt hurts their pride, I laugh inside\nAnd they still whine 'cause I'm the kind to remain King\nI run this scene\n\n[Verse 3]\nTriple popping pills while they still in a saddy bag\nI couldn't wait, if you ask I just had to lad\nIt's the way I am, yeah I'm on a detox\nI'm getting tested, who wants to wee swap?\n'Cause my piss filled with LSD\nAnd I've never ever, ever, ever, ever been clean\nThey say the Kers gets repetitive\nWell I like to blame that on the sedatives\nYeah I said it kid, don't fucking do drugs\nNext minute biting belts as you shoot up\nWhat the fuck? You ain't even listen lad\nNow I've gotta write a whole new mission pat\nTo get cunts clean, throw jabs like Mundine\nHolding knives in both hands, wanna make a cunt bleed\nO plus G's, I'm sipping lean\nI don't need a Nebs beat to be spitting mean, yep\n\n[Hook]\nThey see me shine, they see me win\nIt hurts their pride, I laugh inside\nAnd they still whine 'cause I'm the kind to remain King\nI run this scene\nThey see me shine, they see me win\nIt hurts their pride, I laugh inside\nAnd they still whine 'cause I'm the kind to remain King\nI run this scene"}], "artist": "Kerser"}
