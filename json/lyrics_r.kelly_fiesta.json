Kelly]\nChilling in my four point six at the light\n'Bout to be VIP for the night\nShorty in the drop top V made a right\nPull up to her bumper, baby beeped twice\nJumped out the whip like I was the police\nDidn't have a gun, but my wrist said freeze\nGot Friday on a DVD\nShe's a baller and I'm a baller\nWha-what?\n\n[Chorus: R. Kelly]\nTo all my hot girls living fiesta\nTo all my hot boys living fiesta\nTo all my Chi-town niggas, fiesta\nAnd all my uptown niggas, fiesta\nTo all my players and my hustlers, fiesta\nAnd if you sitting on them blades, fiesta\nTo all my honies in the club, fiesta\nAnd if you rolling with a thug, fiesta\n\n[Verse 2: R. Kelly]\nWe be off in the club sipping lot\nRed-eye deep in the club puffing lye\nStrippers in the back of the club showing live\nSoon as I get a buzz I'm showing out\nHouse on top of the hill, counting what?\nWho's gonna buy the bar? Got enough\nTake the haters out in the back, rough 'em up\nI'm a baller, now where's my ballers?\nWha-what?\n\n[Chorus: R. Kelly]\nTo all my hot girls living fiesta\nTo all my hot boys living fiesta\nTo all my Chi-town niggas, fiesta\nAnd all my uptown niggas, fiesta\nTo all my players and my hustlers, fiesta\nAnd if you sitting on them blades, fiesta\nTo all my honies in the club, fiesta\nAnd if you rolling with a thug, fiesta\n\n[Bridge: R.
