I would have made these damn songs anyway\nSome of y'all still listen to 'em everyday, beautiful thing, I bow my hand and pray\n\n[Hook - Brother Ali] - 2X - w/ ad libs\nI love the life I live, my laughter and my tears\nI don't know where it's goin but I like it like it is\n\n[Verse 2 - Brother Ali]\nUh, I get a lot of love in my hometown, twin cities, y'all know how it go down\nSame club where Prince shot \"Purple Rain\", advertise my name and it's sold out\nI'm surrounded by greatness, my loved ones are amazin\nSometimes I look in their faces and just think of the lives they're changin'\nAnd I don't just mean Rhymesayers, my son's grandmother quit freebasin'\nDesiree got eight years straight, now that right there cause for celebration\nAh, I'm so happy for her, we used to fight like cats and dogs\nBut she ain't even mad that I left her daughter\nShe calls me her son, so that's my mama\n\n[Hook] - w/ ad libs\n\n[Verse 3 - Brother Ali]\nAh, keep it goin now\nAll my life I had this music, my heroes have all saluted\nI don't need y'all to like my new shit, them dudes are the reason I do this\nI done did so much cool shit, lived a lifetime in the last two years\nGot the memories to prove it, look what a dude who ain't even graduate high school did\nHa, used to always be the new kid, laughed at cause I never used to pull chicks\nNow I turn down more girls than them rich ass pretty football playin fools get\nSometimes I smile so wide, I think about the dreams that I've lived\nShit even if I died tonight y'all, I'm the luckiest son bitch that ever lived\n\n[Hook] - w/ ad libs until the end", "year": null, "album": "Us"}], "artist": "Brother Ali"}
