(Do something crazy!)\nDon\u2019t want every day to be the same thing\nWould be a shame to miss the beauty that the rain brings\nWhen the change intimidates and says remain tame\nLook it in its face and say that ain't how he became king\nKing, king, but really I don\u2019t need much\nWhen it comes to time I want for mine to be on recess\nNo more feeling tied up in complete stress\nBig sigh of relief\nI have reset\n\n[Chorus: Major Myjah]\nWhen the crows fly away\nAnd the sun decides to come out\nAnd all my dreams awake\nAnd I feel free again\nThe crows fly away\nAnd the sun decides to come out\nAnd all my dreams awake\nAnd I feel free again\n\n[Post-Chorus: Major Myjah]\nJust let me be right\nJust let me be right\nJust let me be right\nJust let me be right\nJust let me be right\nJust let me be right\nJust let me be right\nJust let me be right\nJust lettin' the beat ride\nJust lettin' the beat ride\nJust lettin' the beat ride\nJust lettin' the beat ride\nJust lettin' the beat ride\nJust lettin' the beat ride\nJust lettin' the beat ride\nJust lettin' the beat ride", "year": "2014-04-22"}]}
