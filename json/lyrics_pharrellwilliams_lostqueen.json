It's automatic\nGet your motor runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom\nI'm never too busy to tell you that you're pretty\nAin't gotta ask me to\nSurprise you in the city when your day is goin' shitty\nAin't gotta ask me to\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat planet are you from, girl?\nAnd are there others like you there?\nAnd could you do that magic trick again?\nPoppin' up from nowhere\nThough my planet's full of warfare\nYou make it feel like a dream\nMan I hope they never find you\n\n[Chorus]\nI think you are a lost queen\nLet me serve you, serve you\nHot sex and gold, shiny things\nI think you are a lost queen\nLet me serve you, serve you\nRemind you that you are a lost queen\nI think you are a lost queen\n\n[Verse 2]\nI don\u2019t have a problem meeting mommy and daddy\nHoney and sugar, man I bet they're so classy\nHalf of me is good, the other half nasty\nCan't help it if I want it, want it\nSure I meet your friends on my best behavior\nTalk about relationships, I used to be a player\nAnd like GEICO, the time I saved 'em\nAnd get their motors runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom\nLift your head when you're down so you don't drop your crown\nAin't gotta ask me to\nAnd right before we finish, I'll ask you did you get it\nAin't gotta ask me to\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat planet are you from, girl?\nAnd are there others like you there?\nAnd could you do that magic trick again?\nPoppin' up from nowhere\nThough my planet's full of warfare\nYou make it feel like a dream\nMan I hope they never find you\n\n[Chorus]\nI think you are a lost queen\nLet me serve you, serve you\nHot sex and gold, shiny things\nI think you are a lost queen\nLet me serve you, serve you\nRemind you that you are a lost queen\nI think you are a lost queen\n\nBonus Track", "year": "2014-03-03"}]}
