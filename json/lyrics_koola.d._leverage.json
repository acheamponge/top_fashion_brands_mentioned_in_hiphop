[Woolly Bully?]\nLouie Louie, I gotta go\nShout to Yazzie and the whole damn Navajo nation\nJill Gibbons used to stay playing chess and drive around with the pot and on acid\nI flash back and forwards, I don't need no more words, I do me groovy\nHeh, you feel me? Sit back, cold beverage, writing Leverage"}]}
