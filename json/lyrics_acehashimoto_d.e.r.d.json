I did with lately\nWould never let a chick make or break me\nBut real talk, if I gave you a shot\nYou did me bogus, the other you're not\nNo one for me, so I guess I'll keep it moving\nBecause my jewelry was sevens, while my [?] time grooving\nWe're moving irrelevant girls out of my life\nThis is HiCLAS!, homie, signing off, good night\nYeah", "year": "2009-12-25", "album": "Your Favorite!
