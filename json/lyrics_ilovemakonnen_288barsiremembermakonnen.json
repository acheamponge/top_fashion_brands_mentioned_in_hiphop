rhyme\nI don't even sell no dimes, cause I do not have no time\nBut I used to reminisce when me and my homies was on the grind\nAll the time, tryna shine cause we need them new things\nNow a boy got pinky rings, switching lanes with 6 chains\nI don't even give a fuck, used to have a black truck\nAll the way in zip codes that I do not go no mo\nOh shit, I got shows every motherfuckin' weekend\nMe and my best friends ain't fuckin' speakin\n'\u2028Got friends from down under arrivin' in the morning\nTell 'em that Makonnen is the best thing goin\nWorldwide, now you know it, finally I can show it\nYoung boy in the city lookin' like I'm fuckin' growin'\nAll the way with the moon, ocean sun when it be snowin\n'\u2028I don't know how I got it, I'm so thankful for the flowin'\nMy friends, once again, when they come back around\nI remember all night, we was sellin' that brown\nTo some motherfuckin' junkies, I was actin' like a monkey\nSwingin' off them god damn trees\nMakin' hunnid of them things\nAll damn night with the white, now a nigga barely see\nAny type of fuckin' drugs, who the fuck is me?\nI just once was a young boy, on the fuckin' corner\nSellin' all this dope from Atlanta to California\nAnd now I brought it back all the way to the West\nCuz them niggas in the East said that I was one of the best\nSo I'm like, let me go, see if the rumors true\nWhen I step off in the room, niggas be mad at who?\nWhen I step in studios, niggas tryna sound like who, now\nGod damn, I ride around in black fuckin' coupes now\nDon't even need to pick it up\nNigga come deliver me\nFeel like
