{"songs": [{"title": "Pissed Off", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Akala]\nTrue Words are never beautiful\nBeautiful words are never true\nEvery truly clear thing\nNeed never prove\nIf it is not enough, it will probably never do\nEver feel like someone lives your life but it is never you?\nYou? Not knowing if coming, going or flowing\nEvery door that you open\nA key to another one that's broken\nEvery word that is spoken\nSomebody else's poem\nAnd the more that we focus\nThe less we ever seem to notice\nIt's like the sound of the letterbox early in the morning\nBut you know it's nothing good\nJust a red letter warning\nSucking every penny that we got\n'Til we ain't got a pot left\nAll this pressure on my back\nDo we want it off off off? YES!\n\n[Hook: Akala]\nDo you feel pissed off just like me?\nDo you feel pissed off just like me?\nDo you feel pissed off just like me?\nI got an idea just why that might be\n\n[Bridge 1: Akala]\nWe touch it, we taste it, we take a sip\nWe breathe it, we need it, it invades our lips\nWe hold it, we own it, it controls our grip\nIt's something, it's nothing\nIt's just how we live\nI can't call it\nIt's something with how we live\nI can't call it\nIt's something with how we live\nI can't call it\nIt's something with how we live\nIt's something, it's nothing\nIt's just how we live\n\n[Verse 2: Akala]\nTrue Words are never beautiful\nBeautiful words are never true\nWhat is your view?\nBlessings or curses, are never ever few?\nThe man with no mind\nThe one who will never choose\nThe skin with no feeling is the one that will never bruise\nWe can't feel it, we touch it, we taste it, we breathe it\nWe peel it, eat it, believe it, we feed it\nHeed it, we need it, defeat it?\nWon't even meet it\nTo beat it you have to seek it\nCheat it? You just release it\nBeneath it you get the secret\nIt's not real\nGuns don't kill, the people behind them do\nAll the ism, schisms, divisions, if you decide it's true\nThey are doing nothing, shit\nJust what they're designed to do\nLook close enough at your enemy\nAnd you will find it's you\n\n[Hook & Bridge 1:Akala]\n\n[Verse 3: Akala]\nTrue Words are never beautiful\nBeautiful words are never true\nThe liar is the only one in the world that is never true\nFly all over the world but never move\nThe only vehicle he have, we never use\nTalk a lot about dreams but never do\nIs this just me and you?\nStuck in this position\nWishing we even had a mission\nAnd wouldn't spend 40 years barely chasing a living\nJob that we hate with a dying soul\nBoss that we'd like to strangle slow\nThe partner we live with we don't even know\nBecause the man in the mirror is just another freak show\nStand like a pillar but what do we hold?\nHave a lot of things but what do we really own?\nAbsolutely nothing\nWe're just bluffing the entire show\nAll of our discussions\nAnd our fussing over the price of Gold\nShould we be reminded that a Diamond is just crushing coal?\nAnd they don't own it\nIt's we that make up the motive\nThey are not giants, just notice\nThey only stand on our shoulders, shit\nAnd they don't own\nIt's we that make up the soldiers\nThey are not giants, just notice\nThey only stand on our shoulders\n\n[Hook 2: Akala]\nDo you feel pissed off just like me?\nDo you feel pissed off just like me?\nDo you feel pissed off just like me?\nI've got an idea why the fuck that might be\n\n[Bridge 2: Akala]\nWe feel that we are not in control of our own lives\nWe see that we are not in control of our own lives\nWe taste that we are not in control of our own lives\nIt's clear that we are not in control of our own lives\nBut we are more in control, then we could ever know\nBut we are more in control, then we could ever know\nBut we are more in control, then we could ever know\nThe steering wheel is right there, just grab a hold", "year": null, "album": " The Thieves Banquet", "image": "https://images.genius.com/acaf5708a18660f33365d7d63e4937b7.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
