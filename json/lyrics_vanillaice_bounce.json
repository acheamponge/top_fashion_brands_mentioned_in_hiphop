And let it all\nHang out like prostitutes. For those that don't\nKnow, I'm back up in ya grill. Set it off, can I do\nAnother spill, I make the speakers go boom in\nYour ear. Write a rhyme, put it together like\nShakespeare. Drop it in the streets, you bump it\nIn your Jeeps. We make it phat enough, Now\nEverybody get your drinks up Get your drinks\nUp Get your drinks up Get your drinks Get your\nDrinks Get your drinks up\n\nPut your head in the air\nBounce like you really don't care\nBounce Bounce\nI could take you there\nBounce Bounce\nAre you scared? Tell me, are you scared?\n\nBaby, put your head in the air\nBounce like you really don't care\nBounce Bounce\nI could take you there\nBounce Bounce\nAre you scared? Tell me, are you scared?\n\nCause I get crazy, party with your friends all\nNight. In the club feeling love, everything's all\nRight. Now Come on along and just ride this\nSong. To the proper cuttin rhythm. Dj cuttin it\nRaw, To the break dawn, Got it going on, Keep\nYou hot in the shade, While I go in a rage, I got\nPounds and pounds of this so go on down to\nThis, I ain't net to this, Woo, dope I'm sellin ya\nKeepin' you coming back, Capable of cutting up\nThe party like a lumberjack, Thought I wasn't\nCapable but yet I get the flava bro, Back to the\nLab, grab the pen and pad. Yeah, droppin' science\nThat you thought I never had, And if you came\nHere to party like you don't give a Fuck. Put your\nDrinks up, Put your drinks up, Wooha, Wooha", "album": "Platinum Underground", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6cb6a5698568a3c6d4ee16b134b1f6ce.640x640x1.jpg"}]}
