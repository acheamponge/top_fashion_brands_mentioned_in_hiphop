{"songs": [{"title": "When I Spot The Loot", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nDollar dollar bill, y'all\nMoney, paper\nCheese, cheddar\nScrilla, spot the loot\n\n[Hook]\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nAnd any other alternative does not compute\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nAnd any other alternative does not compute\n\n[Verse 1]\nPaper chase, it's a paper chase\nAnd if you don't think so, let me make the case\nOn your mark, get set, gotta make the race\nAnd if you come into my lane, you better make some space\nCause folks'll do anything to get that note\nLike politicians out tryna get that vote\nOr the media following to get that quote\nAnd if you fall short, baby, that's all she wrote\nWhether rich or poor, people want some more\nWanna do a little better than they did before\nThey can hate their job, but they know the score\nThat the paycheck's simply what they working for\nWanna buy anything from a fancy store\nOr get the nice out by the shore\nLadies to adore, lookin' hot and cute\nThat's what I think about when I spot the loot\n\n[Hook]\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nAnd any other alternative does not compute\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nAnd any other alternative does not compute\n\n[Verse 2]\nI first grabbed the mic when I heard the beat\nAnd then laid the hot joint to alert the street\nBut I had to do more than just serve the heat\nHad to raise the bottom line on my balance sheet\nHad to make my mission statement clear\nJust to put hot songs into your ear\nTo erase my doubts, overcome my fear\nAnd transform my hobby into a career\nIf you understand that, you can understand this\nI put every bit of effort into how I planned this\nOn tour to ensure the fans that man this\nWith my eyes on the prize so I'll expand this\nI worked hard to get it, you can take it from me\nBut you better get your own, you can't take it from me\nCause I'm breaking in, see, like a top recruit\nAnd that's how I go about it when I spot the loot\n\n[Hook]\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nAnd any other alternative does not compute\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nAnd any other alternative does not compute\n\n[Verse 3]\nLight bill, phone bill, cable bill, damn\nGas bill, water bill, got me in a jam\nInternet, Blackberry, they know who I am\nAnd that's on top of breaking off Uncle Sam\nAnd I ain't even mention either mortgage or rent\nOr the car, no payment for the money they lent\nAnd the credit card charge, man, its hard to prevent\nNo matter how much you make, its like its already spent\nNow there ain't no doubt that it's hard to cope\nBut that ain't no reason to give up hope\nYou can see yourself sliding the slope\nBut if you reach out ya hand, you might find a rope\nNow here's my point, and there's no dispute\nYo, for hard work, there's no substitute\nIf you plant a seed, then you'll bed a fruit\nAnd that's the way I feel about it when I spot the loot\n\n[Hook]\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nAnd any other alternative does not compute\n(Hey!)\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nAnd any other alternative does not compute\n(One more!)\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nAnd any other alternative does not compute\n(Hey!)\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nWhen I spot the loot, I'm in hot pursuit\nAnd any other alternative does not compute", "album": "Relentless", "year": "2008-08-01", "image": "https://images.genius.com/08c3be4c0ddd7a7107b37d924261e3a0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young MC"}
