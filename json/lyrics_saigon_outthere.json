Shiet\u2026\n\n[Chorus - Saigon and (Diana Ross Sample from \u201cSleepin\u2019\u201d)]\nOut there\u2026 (He's been out there, out there, out there\u2026)\nIn the streets you know\u2026 (In the street you know\u2026)\nI was out there, man.  Really doing the years.  Really busting guns, man.  Let me talk to \u2018em.  (And strugglin', scufflin' trying to survive\u2026)\n\n[Verse 1 \u2013 Saigon]\nI\u2019ve been out and about there\nWiling since ten and a half\nRunnin\u2019 from cops, \u2018cause I ain\u2019t never like gettin\u2019 harassed\nI would tell them niggas to kiss my ass\nThey\u2019d tell me, \u201cGet on the wall.\u201d  (Phoom!)  And that\u2019s when I dashed\nUsed to flash my lil\u2019 du-knot\u201420\u2019s, over one-hundred ones\nEating Chick-O-Stick and Big Bol bubble gum\nWas young but hung with niggas that slung jummies\nBeing a dumb dummy who disrespected my mummy\nAnd I never forgot who put me on this Earth\nWho brought me up right and who loved you since your birth\nBut that didn\u2019t stop me from stealing money out her purse\nCursing at her worse than an Eminem song verse\nThirsty for street love \u2018cause I ain\u2019t feel itthat home\nThree years later, I\u2019m thirteen, concealing that chrome\nReady or not, like L-Boogie, Pras, and Wyclef\nI promised my cousin Woody I\u2019d ride to my death\n\n[Chorus - Saigon and (Diana Ross Sample from \u201cSleepin\u2019\u201d)]\nI was out there\u2026 (He's been out there, out there, out there\u2026)\nIn the streets you know\u2026 (In the street you know\u2026)\nIn the muthafuckin streets, man.  Brooklyn, Spring Valley, New Berg, Virginia, B.A.  (And strugglin', scufflin' trying to survive)\nNigga, out there\u2026 (Out there, out there, out there\u2026)\nBustin\u2019 shit.  Robbin\u2019 shit.

Why?  Nigga, I might spoil it\nIt\u2019s not fair, we out there.  They rap about it and live\nThey act like it ain\u2019t, but nigga that\u2019s what it is\nIf you really did what you said, you would\u2019ve been dead\nWith ten in your head or on the Feds with me in yo\u2019 bed\nMe, I\u2019ve moved on.  I was doing wrong for too long\nTorn, watchin\u2019 Satan, miseducatin\u2019 the newborn\nRead the Qur\u2019an, check atrocity, [?]\n\n[Chorus - Saigon and (Diana Ross Sample from \u201cSleepin\u2019\u201d)]\nOut there\u2026 (Out there, out there, out there\u2026)\nEvery day, man\u2026 In the street, man\u2026 (In the street you know\u2026)\nTeaching the youngsters, know what\u2019m saying?
