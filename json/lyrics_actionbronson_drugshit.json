{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nStraight from the depths of Queens\nLeave you sleeping on the mezzanine\nLike you Lincoln, and switch into a desert scene\nOften heard, but this motherfucker seldom seen\nI'm throwing blows while you're waiting for the bell to ring\nDrug smoking, raisins make the pasta sweet\nSlumped over when the barrel and your posture meet\nStay lean like some motherfucking ostrich meat\nYou full of shit, it's time to get a colonoscopy\nScissor kicks, dick's up for Miss Elizabeth\nLex Luger arms, four in the morning in the dark with the computer on\nWaste of my time - my thoughts are patient, [?] replaced in my mind\nBorn to shine like the eyes on a cat\nSame cat fuck around, put the knife in your back\nCause it's nothing, we live and let die and roam the land\nAnd you bluffing, you lifted the cards and showed your hand, pussy\nTailor-made rubber, rubber made reliable\nNever spill the soup, rock a linen suit\nPlay the streets like the ball court, spin and shoot\nStrong as Popeye, dipping in a spinach Coupe\nPull my nuts out your mouth, let me breathe for a minute, please\nYour life is cheap like a hooker in the Philippines\nAbout to be a huge star and I'm still in Queens\nYou on the shelf like a figurine\nDrugs infesting my mind, but I'm destined to shine\nSpit the shit to keep these motherfuckers pressing rewind\nThousands of pounds of pressure pressed on your spine\nLift the vine, free the bonds - lead the blind, read the signs\nHands up like you stepping in the party\nNow you getting robbed, motherfucker, with the shotty\nSaid you pottied - make your body do an ollie\nThen dig your shorty out cause I geeked her up on molly\nHave her eating dick, no need for seasoning\nIf seven dudes are in the room, then she's pleasing 'em\nLike a tropper, hit her in the pooper\nThrow her in the shower then I take her out to LUPA\nI'm kinky, I'll hit it even if it's stinky\nPut 'em in the shower, make the pussy brand-new\nRan through, give her money's what I can't do\nStuff her lunch box and burn her with a candle\nConsensual rate, vinegar solutions\nAnimal abusing, down with revolutions\nDon't get me pissed off, fuck around, rip your tits off\nStill getting head even if my dick soft\nRising quick, no Fleischmann's\nI'm in the end zone with one leg up, posing like Heisman\nThrow it like Theismann, suede foot\nWith the village leader, smoking a pipe with seven wise men\nI eat the biggest piece of chicken at the table\nLet 'em know I'm hungry, Polo on the Rugby\nThe .44 long, surely got a trusty hove\nTryna live the American dream, Dusty Rhodes, yeah", "title": "Drug Shit", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/4c92d833aae01e64b71a556bb1cb9f0b.990x660x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
