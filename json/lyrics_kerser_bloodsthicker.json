That's trash\nStill with the saddie bag stashed in the front seat\nStill got these chatty lads thinking they can compete\nWith the sickest, ain't no chance for that\nAnd your missus love the Kers when she dance to rap\nI'm what the scene needed, you fuckin' it up\nPutting coke in your missus, straight up in her cunt, she's fucked\n\n[Verse 3: Rates]\nWe got that bad man, that aggression with rap\nIt's a lesson in fact, two images and you can't remember what you snapped\nCrash, take 'em to your legs and your back\nEvery line that you ever crossed and tred in your tracks\nWe ain't generic spitters\nYeah you've all got the same [?]\nIt's funny when we rock up and they hit the legs like Usain Bolt\nThe same old with my team, and I will kill for all of 'em\nAnd they would do the same so check these bangers, we recorded 'em\nMy brother is my blood brother, the cunt's killin' all of 'em\nWhen it comes to real shit my blood's thicker than water yeah\nWe sparked a slaughter yeah\nWe started right there\nWe fuckin' partied 'til there's fire in the quiet air\n\n[Verse 4: Kerser]\nThe quiet air and we standing like right there\nWe can tell how they stand that they're quite scared\nRight there, blood brothers of rap\nCunts running, you're whack\nYou catch one in your back\nSince we stepped in the game, we come repping with flame\nThe name remains in your brain 'til you're aching in pain\nBut I just give you life through words, and it kinda spins me out\nDoctors say I need their help but I don't feel like sitting down\nI'm a man, I remain on my feet\nI'm the rapper that these rappers are training to be\nI'm the one of a kind, but then some of the time\nSo stress eats me alive, never run they will find\nAll right"}], "artist": "Kerser"}
