Yawk! Yawk!)\nGet it, get it, got it, good\n(Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!)\nGet it, get it, got it, good\n(Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!)\nGet it, get it, got it, good\n(Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!)\nGet it, get it, got it, good\n\n[Verse 1: S.O.]\nGet it, get it, got it\nI ain't tryna brag with what's in my wallet\nSee that lady winking at me\nTell that lady bird I ain't on it\nThink what you want my man, you're my team\nBut you ain't gettin' none of my Bonet\nChrist rules everything around me\nThat cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me is all that I'm wantin'\nI'm wantin' my life to be like His\nStand where the righteous picked up the pen and I'm writing\nKicked off the care what appears that I'm here\nBut appear when I once used the pair but I'm right\nYeah, Yeah, light shine bright\nIn the night with the right wear\nI'm thinkin' hindsight, thinkin' My Dear\nI'm duckin' the limelight seein' my fear\nI'm busy just setting the scene\nThey chasin' the lizzy well let 'em be seen\nI could feel pressure but I am a messenger\nTryna get people to trust in The King (My God)\nThe One that they call Yahweh\nStand firm and affirm till they call my name\nOne thing I have blood bettin' on my days\nUnaware of a snake see I'm on that grace\nI feel the pressure huh\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Json]"}], "artist": "Json"}
