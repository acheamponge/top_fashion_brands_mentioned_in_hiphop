That's a rookie mistake\nShe love crackin' codes like a kid loves cake\nInfiltration in fifteen minutes, I wish my password wasn't my name\nThat's real nigga shit, now I gotta deal with this bitch\nMouth and her hand submissions\nGotta watch 'cause her stance South Pole position\nPlenty swings all missin' 'cause she rather be kissin'\nCrazy 'cause it took two months to get it\nProbably went through way too much to hit it\nBut I got it and I'm tryna keep it\nCause we celebrate every weekend\nAnd she polish it every evenin'\nLove is a hell'uva drug\nBut it still rule out my addiction to lust\nEvery time I leave out she lose a little of trust\nEvery step that I take it increase the stars\n'Cause girl I'll be back when I'm back not givin' a fuck\nBut I'll be devastated if it's splitin' us up\nIt's a double-edge sword, a two-sided war\nBut instead of making peace I still reach for the door, damn\nDamn, damn\n\n[Chorus]\nAll that is worth it if I got you babe, here\nAll that is worth it if I got you babe, here\nAll that is worth it if I got you babe, here\nAll that is worth it if I got you babe\nIt's worth it if I got you", "title": "Password", "album": "Big Baby DRAM", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a01101e6d0af1e6a6c6bd062579f30f8.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DRAM"}
