Y'all better win!!\"\nPut the rim on the street: \"Aight, a'ight! Let's play to ten.\"\n'Till that morning knock on the door. We hear it from his mom\nSaying Man just got jumped! We don't know if he gonn' survive\nInsane! Couldn't stop the bleeding from his brain\nHe's gone. Tears shared; the block was never the same\n\nAs time passes...\n\nYeah, Puritan Ave. looking over your shoulder\nDon't realize you from the ghetto 'till you get a little older\nOn some summer time high B, summer time Spike Lee\nSomehow I had that white Range Rover out nightly\nCalling my nigga Dre up...like: \"Yo I got that whip let's dip!\"\nYou see these chicks that wanna lay up when they see that truck creep in\nGrey goose, hotel rooms, like every weekend\nBitches that wanna blaze up [Inhale]\nBlowin' money at the young age of [cough cough]\nWhat you expect from some young players?\nThat never seen and never had nothin'\nBut make money of making rap shit\nAnd start living fast, put some cash stuntin'\n\n[Beat development]"}], "artist": "Black Milk"}
