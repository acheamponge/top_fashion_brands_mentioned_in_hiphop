Yo, I\u2019m thankful for that\nThankful for every question that you bank on a [?]\nHopin\u2019 that he might stumble, fallin\u2019 flat on his back\nAnd so polite, most the times no one\u2019s thankin\u2019 him back\nIt\u2019s that socialite, a certain few are hopin\u2019 he dies\nBut hoping is inaction so they know he\u2019ll survive\nHe\u2019s grown to his height, regardless, you still know that he\u2019ll rise\nAnd realise you\u2019ll always see him if you open your eyes\n\n[Chorus]\nI feel this is what I see\nWalkin\u2019 on an empty road\nCrooked footsteps underway\nNever knowin' where to go\nNo realness, all a dream\nStarin\u2019 at my life below\nHope my life\u2019ll form a trail\nTo get where I wanna go, I don\u2019t understand\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou have doubts believin\u2019 you\u2019ll be somethin\u2019\nBut doubts are your enemy, lead you to see nothin\u2019\nYou can\u2019t help it, you\u2019re eager to see somethin\u2019\nYou\u2019re seein\u2019 your dream stuck and you\u2019re needin\u2019 the freedom to be\nOne with yourself and you\u2019re runin\u2019 through hell\nLived a life of others, never fell in love with himself\nAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s needed to ever be completed and knowin\u2019 what\u2019s true\nAlways defeated \u2018cause you never will focus on you\nAnd yo, it\u2019s good to be compassionate\nBut give yourself an itch or somethin\u2019 or your spirit takes some damagin\u2019\nThere\u2019s no accidents, just fate and destiny too\nSo why have a million friends and one enemy \u2013 you\nAnd I can tell you callin\u2019 for help\nYou gotta try and work it out and maybe call on yourself\nAnd put down the shield and maybe talk to yourself\nThat\u2019s your main biggest problem, you\u2019re at war with yourself\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIn your life, there\u2019s one to find\nYou gotta know it takes some time\nBut when you work it out you feel\nBetter than before\nAnd in your life, there\u2019s one to find\nYou gotta know it takes some time\nBut when you work it out you feel\nBetter than before\n\n[Chorus]\nI feel this is what I see\nWalkin\u2019 on an empty road\nCrooked footsteps underway\nNever knowin' where to go\nNo realness, all a dream\nStarin\u2019 at my life below\nHope my life\u2019ll form a trail\nTo get where I wanna go, I don\u2019t understand"}]}
