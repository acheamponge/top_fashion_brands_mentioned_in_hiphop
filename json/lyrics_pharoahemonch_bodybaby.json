Doin' you. You make me hot\n\nPharoahe's that nigga and the other thinking it's wishful\nSick wit it with a ridiculous flow\nTake over, make over, move over\nShow's over, flows over, who Told ya?\n\nIt's a down, except I flipped the script tho\nFrom the window to the wall just get low\nRock and roll, hip-hop music, and disco\nT dot O to Atlanta to Frisco\n\nRufis, oh yeah, with a new twist oh\nSo y'all can get a gist of the rhyme that I do not miss. I will not fail\nPlease take a glimpse at the time at your own risk. I will not bail\n\nFuck da boys, grab the flock. The planet rock\nThe fiends and the fan on the block\nTeam's scheme on the knock\nMy hand, you want, dreams of your man\n\nOh!\nOh!\n\nI've got just what you want. (What I want)\nYou've got just what I need. (What I need)\nYou want my body baby (Body baby) So let me plant the seed. (Plant the seed)\n\nYou are my heart's desire. (Heart's Desire)\nYou set my soul a fire. (Soul on fire)\nI wanna. Doin' you. You make me hot\n\nGrab the master's plans with ease\nThose seeds can't see past me\nNo patch in the plan, the raps are not flash\nFree at last- We never recycle the same songs from last week\n\nThank God almighty , we are free at last\nWe went back to ash, before raps harassed me\nNo relax. Do not pass. Do not ask me\nBut you can get backstage where you can see ass free\n\nElope- The Goat\nNigga vote for ya boy\nI hope ya lied to the rope and the board\nSmokin the dope\nRelate to the gate\nTo the words you wrote, with the moving the scales ya say:\n\nI've got just what you want. (What I want)\nYou've got just what I need. (What I need)\nYou want my body baby (Body baby) So let me plant the seed. (Plant the seed)\n\nYou are my heart's delight. (Heart's Desire)\nYou set my soul  . (Soul on fire)\nI wanna. Doin' you. You make me hot\n\nI've got just what you want. (What I want)\nYou've got just what I need. (What I need)\nYou want my body baby (Body baby) So let me plant the seed. (Plant the seed)\n\nYou are my heart's delight. (Heart's Desire)\nYou set my soul a fire. (Soul on fire)\nI wanna. Doin' you. You make me hot\n\nHow's everybody feeling out there?\nYou want my body baby?\nI'll give you my body baby\nYou want it\nI'll give it to ya\n(mumbling)\nYou want my body baby?\n\nThank you very much.
