{"songs": [{"title": "Non Stop", "lyrics": "Well if you listen, you're learnin'\nThe money I'm earnin'\nOut from Hollis, Queens, and not from Mt. Vernon\nPeople all over the place, I'm tellin' you now\nIt's guaranteed for treble and bass, and showin' you how\nTo kick out rhymes like a blizzard kicks snow\nCause my name is Young MC, the boy that's good to go\nCause I'm rough like Hunter, clever like MacGyver\nRock the mic all 24/7, don't spit saliva\nCold like ice and hot like fire\nGivin' you a shock like a plug and a wire\nCause people go crazy when the mic's in my hand\nCause I'm like a Robocop and you're a regular man\nMy rhymes are mine and not stolen, the mic that I'm holdin'\nYou told me some rhymes that was weak, so I was rollin'\nAround on the ground cause it was so damn funny\nDon't call me honey, no you never make no money\nMy rhymes are written, fresh and never bitten\nI'm standing, you are sittin'\nYou hear me and then you're quittin'\nYou're out of the game, nobody knows your name\nAnd your claim to fame is that you show no shame\nNew York to California, yes coast to coast\nAnd I'm dustin' MCs like Ghostbusters dust ghosts\nI wrote a little record for the hip and the hop\nMy name is Young, the record's called \"Non Stop\"\nNon stop for the rhythm, non stop for the rhyme\nNon stop for the people who are right on time\nNon stop for the treble, non stop for the bass\nNon stop for the brother who is on the case\nI came here to prove a point and to try my best\nTo get the people on the floor in three minutes or less\nThere'll be no time for cuttin', no time for mix\nTo do in three what other rappers can't do in six\nCause I was chillin' at a party, the record was playin'\n\"this is brand new\", that's what the DJ was sayin'\nBut no matter what the people stand on the wall\nThey'd have more fun goin' shoppin' at a shoppin' mall\nSo then the DJ called me over to help out that night\nHe said \"Yo yo that's Young MC\", I said \"Yo yo that's right\"\nSo then I grabbed the microphone, the party started to hop\nCause when I start you know I go non stop\nI'm ready willing and able, the mic and turntable\nIf I'm not on tour, I'm at home watchin' cable\nI made \"My Name is Young\" and I made \"Let Them Know\"\nSo on your mark, get set... here we go\nI make the crowd go insane, don't use cocaine\nI like to travel a lot because I travel by airplane\nSittin' by the window, sleepin' with a bimbo\nTake you off your balance like your life was in limbo\nToo hot to handle, hotter than a candle\nSloppy like Oscar, but neat like Tony Randall\nMy rap is inconceivable, it's unbelievable\nTo me it's easy but to you it's unachievable\nThis is the lowdown, forget about the throw down\nLive from New York, it's a hip-hop hoedown\nMy lip service makes you nervous\nYo don't play dumb, cause you know that you deserve this\nRenegade rebel, rockin' bass, rockin' treble\nTakin' rap to a higher echelon and level\nElevatin' hip-hop, let me make a pit stop\nYo, go tell your friends about the jam they call the non stop", "album": "Stone Cold Rhymin\u2019", "year": "1989-01-01", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7e9ff08751b8e32d468ac9e4127b8bec.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young MC"}
