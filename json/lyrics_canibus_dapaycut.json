Your view too black\nYou must have smoked somethin I used to call pool hall crack\nPut a suit on you still look whack\nSomewhere givin orders from confined quarters, handcuffed to a fag\nPlayed the street too much, shoulda been in the lab\nNow you sad, mad at who you was fussin with last\nLife's a bitch ain't it? Smile, it ain't nothin to laugh\nRose hell at show'n'tell, brought a gun to your class\nKeep the herb on the dash cause I'm servin 'em fast\nClassic lyrics for that ass, cause the purpose is cash\nLook I got a couple photos of you tryin to showboat\nBefore my gunboat touch your throat, don't talk\nThe microphone shark tear your bones apart\nSpread you over your background like bogus art\nPut the most in art, try to focus on the frozen dart\nCold and dark as a cobra's heart\nI drink the absinthe raw, no chaser\nMadness follows me like investigators after Al'Qaeda\nThe metaphor make a voice like Lord Vader\nIf you love hip-hop, I am your saviour\nRip your mixtape up and still take a paycut\nMe and you in the booth, who you think is gon' say somethin?\n'Member ninety-eight when I rung those bells?\nI'm a chip off the old block like Uncle L\nFuck a bootlace, I strap velcro up\nNiggas had gun talk, so what? They still didn't show up\nFuck around with 'Bus on the mic, they got no luck\nOther than that, I don't really know what"}]}
