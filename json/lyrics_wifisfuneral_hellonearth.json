Wow so I guess we down to earth too\nDown to Earth man, these roots gonna hurt you\nPraying five times so I hope that it will bless you\nSitting contemplating on my life in a restroom\nComing live vibe I just die so regretful\nI said coming live vibe I just die so regretful\n\n[Hook]\nHide my face from the world\nI disappear like a magician\nNow my world had done swirled\nFade to black look where I\u2019m at this hell on earth is a curse\nI stage diving ghost riding the whip then right in reverse", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cac6a7c0dead4e1e75cd05c8b05fa65b.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "When Hell Falls", "title": "Hell on Earth"}]}
