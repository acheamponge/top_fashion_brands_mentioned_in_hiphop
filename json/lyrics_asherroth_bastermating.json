are, my raps are unbelievable\nMy raps, my raps\nMy raps are, my raps are unbelievable\nToo advanced for y'all\nGo try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar\nGo try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar\nI spark light with the pen\nMy raps are, my raps are unbelievable\nGo try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar\nGo try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar\nMy raps are, my raps are unbelievable\n\n[Verse 1: Asher Roth]\nI think it's time I play the lotto\nI'm feeling lucky sucker, oh well fuck it is my motto\nGotta bring the ruckus, smoking nuggets, sip moscato\nWith Roscoe Dash while I play his record on serato\nVado's prolly my favorite rapper since Bob Dole\nOdd flow so I drive slow with my eyes closed\nStop stroll, nah yo I'd rather eat hot crow\nClosed throat, gross bro don't forget to swallow\nHollow that's what they try to tell me that my rhymes is\nSo I found God, had to tell him what his Moms did\nWhat is this some fucking sick joke\nLike an anorexic chick putting on a strip show\nNo shit oh bitch go and let them nips show\nLet me see a pole flip and then throw it back ho\nBend that back bone when I take it back home\nHeard I made that ass fat, im a fucking rap pro let's go\n\n[Chorus]\nMy raps are, my raps are unbelievable\nMy raps, my raps\nMy raps are, my raps are unbelievable\nToo advanced for y'all\nGo try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar\nGo try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar\nI spark light with the pen\nMy raps are, my raps are unbelievable\nGo try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar\nGo try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar\nMy raps are, my raps are unbelievable\n\n[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvey]\nMan I came to bring the pain, Twelvey spitting flames\nLive from the 212 with my A dollar gang\nAP Audamar, running like a Viking back\nInstagram with the flow\nAll the hoes be liking that, recite it back\nRun it back, play it over, play it over\nASAP everything, my young nigga\u2019s taking over\nPop Rex make your soda loud its a roll up\nCooking up some shit Ty Dash screaming hold up\nRosay what it do, trill niggas making moves\nCame to give you hell, for the pleasure and the principal\nKicked outta school, school, trapping in the frat house\nGorgeous motherfucker getting pussy like a cat house\nBlow her back out, didn\u2019t bring the stacks out\nThen she got a train, everybody in the stash house\nCarolina blue jays, shit is like Stackhouse\nSipping real slow but a nigga on the fast route\nLast year this time I was on some low shit\nLast year this time y'all was on some ho shit\nBody after body I'm a twelve gauge shotty\nToasted to the most high cause I know that God's got me\n\n[Bridge]\nMan I came to play\nI ain\u2019t talking bout no games today\nMan I\u2019m tripping on the fame today\nMan I aim to spray, step back and let the flame away\nI set it off, man I came to play\nMan I\u2019m tripping on the fame today\nMan I aim to spray, step back and let the flame away\nYo I think I took to many of those\nYo Ash how many was I supposed to take, I think I'm fucked\n\n[Verse 3: Chip Tha Ripper]\nWalk in the most expensive strip club with my dick out\nPitched a fist full of change at the stripper and knocked that bitch out\nToday was my first day at work I brought your dish out\nClip my toenails over your plate to watch you fish out\nPictures of greatness show me wear the cake is\nI'mma take it and shove it all up in the lawmakers faces\nDoing what you feel could be unreal\nI looked up and spit like a half a mill\nPictures of my old crib hanging in my new crib\nRaps and hoes besides those I don\u2019t do shit\nTrying to live extra cool, I don\u2019t fuck with the stress\nLouie condoms, bitch come get fucked with finesse\nThe school pimping the kids, they selling chocolate bars\nMe and my niggas in this bitch and we some chocolate stars\nYou said I fell off, my money said that bitch a liar\nHow you sleeping on Chip when your mattress on fire\nTonight's the night that could change your life girl\nAll you gotta do is give him what he like girl\nA lotta head, a lot of shut the fuck up and chill\nMaybe a twenty-five some and two Viagra pills\n\n[Chorus]\nMy raps are, my raps are unbelievable\nMy raps, my raps\nMy raps are, my raps are unbelievable\nToo advanced for y'all\nGo try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar\nGo try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar\nI spark light with the pen\nMy raps are, my raps are unbelievable\nGo try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar\nGo try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar\nMy raps are, my raps are unbelievable\n\n[Verse 4: YP]\nBlunts rolled now flame up, I done came up\nWhen you steady going up they wanna hang you\nBut I ain't worried until they read me a verdict\nI promise I'ma splurge it cause I feel I deserved it\nI get more from flipping than burgers\nMove from a worker to the chairman of my own operation\nYou could get under, no wonder\nI throw a party and bitches think it's a slumber\nIt's some chicks that spent the night, I never gave em my number\nI'm young Hefner, couple cuties to measure\nHundred and twelve weigh it up, its nothing extra\nAnd when you murdered the pen they wanna test you\nJust dont make me black yo eyes like Uncle Fester\nDon't you know I'm one of them guys go check the record\nHave me get to clapping like the end of a lecture\nI'm building an empire you part of this, you lucky\nThey call me YP but in my city I'm like Nucky\nRipley's couldn't believe it and haters feel the same\nThey dont know about the grand, think juices are Minute Maid\nI tell them all the time, get out, get paid\nAre you here for the long haul or only just a phase", "year": null}]}
