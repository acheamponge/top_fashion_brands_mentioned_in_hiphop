Goin hard at her\nLike REALLY y'know, throwin game at this chick\nBut she had a man, I really- I was runnin in place kinda sorta, y'know\nWe kiss and all that, y'know we'd make out\nBut I never could smash cause she was tryin to be faithful to her man\nYou know how that bullshit goes - anyway, my 21st birthday, it was a wrap\nSo I hit her up like, 'Wassup?! You gon' come hang with me on my 21st birthday?'\nAnd she's on the phone soundin all sad and shit and she's like\n'No.. I CAN'T!' And I'm like, 'Why? What's goin on? What's wrong?'\nAnd she's like, 'My boyfriend got shot today!' And I just, y'know, sit there for a second\nThen I go.. 'Well alright~!! Happy birthday to ME! So wassup?! You're gonna come thru or what?'\nHAHAHAHA! But yeah, long story short., she never did kick it with me that day\nHer boyfriend pulled through and I never did get to smash\nCan't win 'em all, but yeah, that's about the funniest, craziest most fucked-up\nBirthday I ever had, I feel like a pitiful person tellin this shit\nBut that shit was funny, brah! I was drunk man, shit happens\""}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
