But quite clever\"\n\"I'm the sickest\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nI came lyrically known as the most foul clinic\nBiochemist spittin' a mutated AIDS virus\nPuttin niggas careers on cryogenics\nI math with godly wrath when it go all\nLike pinocchio eatin' pussy while he takin' a polygraph\nI'm bane on some angioplasty shit\nJust fuck you out of the frame into your nasty bitch\nSpit epic novels evil and episcopal\nFuck your respect, I done dropped two singles and already my rep is gospel\nIn this world of cutthroats\nI'm a midget with a scalpel and a non remorseful grin\nCircumsizin' everything below the torso skin\nYou fuckin' with the only one in the wet t-shirt contest with a dorsel fin\nI spit fire faggots and fart in a flame\nBackstabber, but I'm terribly takin part in a plan\nGive a fuck whatever, if your ironing it, throw the book at me\nI'm throwin' it back full of pubic hairs with the pages stuck together\nI nut on CDs and shit on tapes\nFar as vinyl, I'm the last cat you wanna see workin at a fast food joint\nTo grasp at our plates, none sicker\nSworn revenge like a driveby car with a rainbow bumper sticker\nI'm lettin off a thick cream blast\nTil the whole planet is sleepin in a wet spot with a well reamed ass\nWhile you playin dreamcast and suckin so many of these rap niggas dicks\nYour mouths starting to look like a Scream mask\n\nHook 2x\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm sick by design shorty because I shine jewelry\nWith blind fury, the underground assigned jury\nTry to accuse me of being too jiggy and shit\nDisregarding the fact that I'm like christlike nice with mass purely\nDraw me with thorns and a bracelet to match\nI'm matter but known to make car stereos and niggas faces detach\nQuintessentially dark intregal, poisonous tipster\nHeart wrinches, spit ink like I was anatomically part tentacle\nSubliminal Vakill disses echo past ya\nWhile I squeeze off til your fucking dosely echo plaster\nCode malice streets got my soul callous\nBut I'm nice like twelve deciples\nSip my blood from a dope chalice, shit\nMy worst effort is madness in reverse method\nShittin' with a jamaican work ethic til this game bitch unfold\nAnd niggas grip my nuts so tight\nI don't know whether to spin or tap out the self-'gnition code\n\nHook 2x", "album": "The Darkest Cloud", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f0fa8d572f04773a721576175bcefb21.488x500x1.jpg"}]}
