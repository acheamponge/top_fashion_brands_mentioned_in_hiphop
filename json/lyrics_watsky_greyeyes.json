Please tell me why\nNo one saw what happened there that night\nThe only clue\u2019s to look you in the eye\nThose gray and cloudy eyes\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nAll the people run and take a side\nDon\u2019t nobody want to break their stride\nBut what if we were to make a mistake\nWith stakes this high?\nNo one\u2019s ever gonna truly heal\nYou want to gamble; who do you let deal?\nWhose future rep do we ruin?\nLet\u2019s spin that roulette wheel!\n\nIt has never been a secret: cowards posin\u2019 as leaders seek\nTo pervert their power and prey on the weak\n\nBut I also\nKnow\nWith an accusation, a wound is made\nYou wouldn\u2019t be the first to wield a rumor\nAs a blade!\n\nFingers pointed like bayonets\nWhat\u2019s it cost you to make a threat?\nDon\u2019t be shy come on place your bet\nIf you roll snake eyes you don\u2019t pay that debt\n\nLet\u2019s set it straight:\nOnly one things certain, that some\u2026 body is the serpent\nAnd were\u2026 you to win that verdict\nSlither out and take your curtain call\n\nLookin\u2019 for a bit of mercy for she\nShoulderin\u2019 a heavy burden with\nNothin\u2019 but cursed choices\nSilence is the worst of all\n\n[Chorus]\n\nWho should I believe? Please tell me why\nKnow one saw what happened there that night\nThe only clue\u2019s to look you in the eye\nThose gray and cloudy eyes\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nI do not share your load on this journey\nI do not wear black robes in the court\nSo I will not bang the gavel; I won\u2019t lock your shackles\nThis is not my trash to sort\n\nFolks who think they\u2019ve found truth tend to tremble\nAny time the ground beneath them shakes\nFind the closest rock to cling to\nLock your fingers into fissures where it breaks\n\nBut what if turns out things aren\u2019t as we know \u2018em\nReapin\u2019 the harvest we\u2019ve sown; Here in this garden of stone\nWhat kind of hideous, selfish obsidian\nHeart do I own?\n\nCould you forgive me if my hesitation\nDemands that you weather this hardship alone?\nHow could you pardon my tone?\nI know that hatred can scar\nThat it can carve to the bone\n\nSo would somebody let me know how do we\nTake shit back to when life was all wonderful?\nGet to buildin\u2019 a home or a chateau we\nCan get comfortable feeling uncomfortable\nI\u2019m not talkin\u2019 a Huxtable\n\nWhat a difficult and retched affair\nPeople seekin\u2019 anything solid\nTo keep them from scratchin\u2019 at air", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1aacc5c51f6e3a30a154e12a7fc3100f.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Oops!
