It's not something we should be striving for. It's a necessity. Equality is like gravity. We need it to stand on this earth as men and women, and the misogyny that is in every culture is not a true part of the human condition. It is life out of balance, and that imbalance is sucking something out of the soul of every man and woman who's confronted with it. We need equality. Kinda now.\u201d\n\n[Hook: Styalz Fuego]\nEven though I want you near me\nI'm on a planet no one knows\nSo even though I've never been here\nI've never felt so at home\nEven though I want you near me\nI'm on a planet no one knows\nSo even though I've never been here\nI've never felt so at home"}]}
