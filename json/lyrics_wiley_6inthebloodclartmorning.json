Eski-boy in the building\nDecember madness\n\n[Verse 1]\nThis ain't a fluke, this ain't a parody\nI be in the hall of fame and art galleries\nVision in my head before Amy did Valerie\nGradually you felt like you knew me and added me\nI am not a present, ain't nobody wrapping me\nShoulders are here, many women they love tapping me\nChatting about how I come across unmannerly\nLike I'm in a bike gang, Sons of Anarchy\nStep on to the track, burn calories\nPekker got me on the higher salary\nHeavier riddims, I got the clarity\nNobody pushed me, nobody carried me\nSearch for comparisons you're only gonna find similarity\nI blaze weed, it controls my sanity\nWithout I couldn't defy gravity\nI'd be a floater, and you'd be mad at me\nI'm from the hood and I ain't new to tragedy\n\n[Hook]\n6 in the bloodclart morning, you follow me\nI run bass, I'm the Bass Odyssey, of course you're dodging me\nFor me to act like I never knew you? It would be odd of me\nIt would be cold of me, it's the older me\nIn effect, directly from the L-O-N\nEast side set, got bangers, got manners\nBut no respect for goal-hangers\nWiser the older I get\n\n[Verse 2]\nI said, nobody's fucking with the shower man flow\nI said, nobody's fucking with the shower man, bro\nYou'd better know\nMan can't handle these levels and I'm sorry bro, you gotta go\nDraw from the pain that I had and the brain that I had\nFrom the days when the money was low\nMic sound crystal clear, we're like Bose\nWalked in the dance, in the war you froze\nMy ability is a par, that's why I don't wanna use it\nIt's lary, start showing off with the music\nShows you, why I lived this why I do this\nShows you, if I'm complacent and abuse it\nGot it installed in my skin, I was born to win\nMaintain so I can't loose it\nI don't know why you wanna question my flow in the game every day, man prove it\nPopping, I got a vibe that's popping\nWon't work blud if your vibe ain't popping\nI've spent so many hours on the radio\nAsk anybody car most of them locked in, popping\nI get it done get it popping\nBeen here for years and the style ain't stopping\nGot a whole back catalogue of songs, but it's a new day got a vibe what's popping\nDon't get stuck, roll with the times\nYou're there in the past, we've grown with the times\nWho do you know from the new generation?\nNo one, cus you don\u2019t roll with the times\nI don\u2019t get blocked man roll with the lions\nI will never get lost man go with the signs\nWhen I was a kid I was in Limehouse blocks\nFriday night man might go to the chimes\nIf you hear me sound whack tell me I\u2019ll get my to bag to pack\nI\u2019ll leave there and I\u2019ll never come back\nI\u2019m sure of myself\nYou\u2019re raw in a crew, but I\u2019m raw by myself, I could tour by myself\nIf its shanks you\u2019re looking for turn back now bro\nI'll bust a roundhouse kick like Shaodow\nStraight in ya chest, hurling dub plates in ya chest\nThat flows without breaks, I\u2019m the best\n\n[Hook]\n6 in the bloodclart morning, you follow me\nI run bass, I'm the bass Odyssey, of course you're dodging me\nFor me to act like I never knew you? It would be odd of me\nIt would be cold of me, it's the older me\nIn effect, directly from the L-O-N\nEast side set, got bangers, got manners\nBut no respect for goal-hangers\nWiser the older I get\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd I think for myself, I was born on my own\nI don\u2019t wanna false friend in my zone\nTell a brudda don\u2019t chat to man, it\u2019s alright\nStay on your side, don\u2019t wan' it with our side\nEnough of them are too ropy\nCan\u2019t cope with all the vultures\nWe don\u2019t want ya here you\u2019re like ulcers\nWe ain't vibing with you cause you\u2019re fake bro\nWhen I speak it\u2019s truth without hate bro\nLet me move on step up the pace\nI had to chill a bit when I got her wet in the face\nHave you ever seen a devil when you step in the rave\nVersace shades and screw face step in ya face\nAnd say what\nI\u2019m too London I\u2019ve realised\nAt 22 I was getting texts from XL and EMI\nLooking like a walking pound sign\nBait as you like they saw my cold town side\nDon\u2019t rub your wins in the face of the hood\nThe outcomes not gonna be good\nI know the real ones and the wannabe Suge\u2019s\nI had to, take time so the quality\u2019s good\nAnd now I\u2019m back in the mix back in the combo\nBack with an umbrella back with a poncho\nIf you got a good vibe you can holler me\nSix in the bloodclart morning you follow me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/31892ca44365988a695f47863567e0c0.631x627x1.png", "album": null, "title": "6 in the Bloodclart Morning"}]}
