Your pops found out you lost that job and shit\nMmm-hmmm\nWell don\u2019t worry homey, man parent be like that sometimes, it\u2019s like they mad at you because they get old. Just don\u2019t go all crazy on me, talking about you going to kill yourself again, alright\n\n[Verse 1: Anybody Killa]\nYes, in my mind I want to do it but when I pursue it I can\u2019t seem to go through it\nSo I\u2019m going to write a song just so you can feel everything I feel when I\u2019m in the mood to kill myself\nI can\u2019t control it, these thoughts of suicide, I\u2019m always dealing with\nAnd I know I\u2019m not alone when it comes to this, cause everyday it\u2019s like the whole world pissed\nSo fuck your attitude and keep your bad mood cause I got one too\nAnd I don\u2019t give a shit who you rolling with bring your whole damn crew\nWe\u2019ll call it suicide when you messin with a killa someone\u2019s bound to die\nAnd it won\u2019t be me cause only one\u2019s claimin my life is g-o-d\n\n[Chorus x2]\nYou ever thought of suicide, you ever thought of suicide, you ever thought of suicide\nGlad you didn\u2019t do it, if you did you wouldn\u2019t be here now\n\n[Verse 2: Anybody Killa]\nAre you easily influenced\nDoes your parents always say that your friends are the reason that you ruint\nDo you have hate for your boss, to where you wanna catch him alone and pop one off\nOr is it mental health, where the only problem that you have is with yourself\nCan someone please explain why it feels so good to cause so much pain\nWith all these thoughts we have, yep it\u2019s easy to say to just relax\nBut when you that fed up, only thing in your mind is how deep to cut\nBecause you hate your life and you really don\u2019t care\nAnd things would be better if you just weren\u2019t here\nSo now you ready to go end it all\nInstead of thinking of the ones you won\u2019t see tomorrow\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\n[Verse 3: Strict 9 & *Anybody Killa*]\nIt\u2019s nothing nice, got the thoughts steadily running through my head\nI close my eyes and try to picture if I\u2019m better off dead\nIt sucks to me, the one and only as I sit here by my lonely\nSeparated from the world cause the world is so phony\nHear my cries, tell me why when you do it tell them lies\nYou wear a disguise I can see it in your motherfuckin eyes\nIt\u2019s suicide, last ride if you wanna get inside\nShotgun it\u2019s your boy and I\u2019m ready to die\n*Do people that commit suicide go to heaven?\nI\u2019m sure everyone has their own theories\nBut I\u2019m a firm believer that if you take you own life\nYour soul is trapped*\n\n[Chorus x2]", "year": "2008-11-25"}]}
