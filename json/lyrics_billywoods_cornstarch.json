Every time I see one of those old guys I...\nEvery time I see one of those old guys [?] I always think the same thing\nWhat do you think?\nI always think that he was once somebody's baby boy. No, really, I do, I think he was once somebody's baby boy and he had a mother and father who loved him and now, there he is, half dead on a park bench"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
