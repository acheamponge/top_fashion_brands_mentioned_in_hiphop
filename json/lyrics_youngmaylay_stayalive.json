Verse\nI got my day to die\nBut id rather stay alive\nAnd see my kids having kids looking in their eyes\nImma meet my maker jesus christ lord and saviour\nBut i hope i dont go down by no haters (the game fishy)\nThe devil's lurkin im up in the same trenches\nWhere is killing revenge for game vengeance its senseless but\nI dont wanna be the victim or whitness or the defendant\nFor chippin' then repentin' for forgiveness\nActing like I didn't but its all in my conscious\nI do it all again i promise just beein' honest (swear to god)\n(on my momma) i ain't tryin' to be violent\nLet me pause moment of silence ..... (for what)\nFor the people that didn't make it to the gates i can't take it\nI need to bathe in holy water naked\nI can't lie im a wrong doer not the kids a whole people in shittin\nA nigga is a long shooter\nAnother calendar another four seasons\nHopefully i make it no grievins\nIf thats how its meant to be\nIts to the tenth degree but i smurk like i did the work\nWhen they sentence me\n\n[Hook]\nAll this jealousy and envy\nAll this hustelin\nThey wanna tell on me\nTo my enemies AR-15\nIm talking Penalties\nIf u run up on me\nI'd rather Stay Alive (6x)\nI'd rather Stay Alive (7x)\n\nAll this jealousy and envy\nAll this hustelin\nThey wanna tell on me\nTo my enemies AR-15\nIm talking Penalties\nIf u run up on me\nI'd rather Stay Alive (6x)\nI'd rather Stay Alive (7x)", "album": null, "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/d48cd974e2683c644e05778ab0768a19.386x386x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young Maylay"}
