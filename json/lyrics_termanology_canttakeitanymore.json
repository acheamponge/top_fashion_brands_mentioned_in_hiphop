Them cats kiddin', I ain't close to pussy\nNever showin' fear, so quote it clear\nCall me Chipper, cause Jones been brave his whole career\nI can't take it\n\n[Interlude: DJ Doo Wop]\nDamn!

Bounce on the twin, just bounce on the twin!\n\n[Verse 3: Termanology]\nI'm the greatest, got two lasers like Darth Vader's\n45 with an Inf beam that's calibrated\nGive it a little kick, it'll open your soul\nAnd let the vultures pluck the eyeballs out of your skull\nFuck a collab, I could get you snuffed on the ave\nBucked and then stabbed, pistol whipped and stuffed in a cab\nYou a small guy, spreadin' all them immature lies\nMake me wanna pull a Joker, stab this pen in your eye\nI hate you like I hate cops, chase you down for 8 blocks\nHit you in the stomach and have you burnin' like straight shots\nMake me wanna spray shots, snatch ya Rollie, take clocks\nIt's gettin' out of hand, this time, you know, take it off\nRun it, the last one you would think of done it\nCause you changed over them dollars, couldn't keep it a hunnit\nGive me patience, 'fore I pistol whip his fuckin' face in\nAnd use the blood for my lil' daughter's face paintings\n\n[Outro: DJ Doo Wop]\nDamn, slow down Term! The mic is officially dead, rest in peace to the microphone! Tonight I told y'all I was in here with straight monsters! Real emcees, baby, Boston, Mass! Brooklyn, New York! Lawrence, Mass! Y'all was representin' so beautifully tonight! DJ Doo Wop, I'm signin' off right now - I can't even say nothin' else, man. This is crazy, this the new hip hop!"}], "artist": "Termanology"}
