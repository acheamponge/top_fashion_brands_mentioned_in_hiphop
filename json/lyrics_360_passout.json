Thank you!)\nYeah\n360, \"Pass Out\"\n\n[Chorus: 360 & Labrinth]\nYeah, yeah, I'm getting large now\nAnd I'll be winning 'cause I'm in it for the stars now\nWent to Sydney, hit up EMI with arms out\nThen I told 'em how I'm gonna murder \"Pass Out\"\nLet it rain, let it pour away\n(Yeah) We won't come down\nUntil we hit the ground and pass out\n\n[Verse: 360]\nAyo, I guarantee you suckers that I'm one of a kind\nChange your perspective and have you wondering why\nI'm being honest when I'm saying that I'm loving my life\nIf life's a bitch, yo, it's 'cause you ain't fucking her right\n(You're pretty loose ayy, 6?) Yeah, mate, I reckon\nI'll pass out drunk on the stairway to heaven\nThese bitches wanna see what making love will get them\nDangerfield shirts; I got a crazy dumb collection\nHad these labels in a bidding war\nHad to decide that if we're gonna be signed and what figure for\nGotta lock 'em in a figure four, see\nBut I've gotta make a killing 'cause I can't be fucked living poor\nI don't do it 'cause I think it'll sell\nI'ma do the same shit if it sits on the shelf\nBut I gotta go and treat it like a business as well\nSo if the shit ain't gonna kill it, I'll be kicking myself\nMe and Pez are gonna see more and get more\nThe champ is in the building, go and gimme my belt (Cheers)\nA major label ain't the be all and end all\nBut trust me, motherfucker, I'm convinced that it helps, yo\nI don't feel like swapping the flow\nKeep doing what I'm doing and I want you to know\nThat it's a one-way street, but I'm blocking the road\nWith no choice but to sit there and watch it explode\nYeah, head overseas, man, burn it down\nAnd fly back, watch him fade in a blurry cloud\nAnd if you got a big sister, go and turn it loud\nThe show's over, so go and put the curtain down (down)\nCheck your size, bitch, you're below me\nIf you pouring me a drink, you better pour it slowly\nI ain't pouring out liquor for my fallen homies\nNah, I'm pouring out liquor 'cause I'm awesome, blow me\n\n[Chorus: 360 & Labrinth]\nYeah, yeah, I'm getting large now\nAnd I'll be winning 'cause I'm in it for the stars now\nWent to Sydney, hit up EMI with arms out\nThen I told 'em how I'm gonna murder \"Pass Out\"\nLet it rain, let it pour away\n(Yeah) We won't come down\nUntil we hit the ground and pass out\n\n[Bridge: Labrinth & Tinie Tempah]\nWhoa\nWhoa-o-o-o-o-o-oh-oh\nWhoa\nWhoa-o-o-o-o-o-oh-oh\nUh, look at me I've been a cheeky [bastard] man and\nLook at all the drama we started, now I'm\nIn here laying on my back\nSaying DJ won't ya gimme one more track\n\n[Refrain: Tinie Tempah]\nI'll apologize for tonight, tomorrow morning\nI'll apologize for tonight, tomorrow morning\nI'll apologize for tonight, tomorrow morning\nI'll apologize for tonight, tomorrow morning\n\n[Chorus: Labrinth]\nLet it rain, let it pour away\nWe won't come down\nUntil we hit the ground and pass out\nSo let it rain, let it pour away\nWe won't come down\nUntil we hit the ground and pass out"}]}
