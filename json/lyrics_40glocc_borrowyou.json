Akon)\n\n[Hook: Akon]\nCan I borrow you for a minute?\nMaybe two or five, maybe for the rest of my life\nBorrow you for a minute\nJust us two it's alright\nIf you decide to be by my side\nI might not give you back\nMight not give you back\nMight not give you back\nIf your here by my side\nMight not give you back\nMight not give you back\nIf your here by my side girl\n\n[Verse 1: 40 Glocc]\nMet me a chick from ATL\nThick as hell\nNames Channel\nShe could tell from the status living well\nLoves my cabbage\nLoves my carrots\nMy grind, my career\nI shine like a chandelier\nTell the pilot\nLand in the middle of the ghetto\nI'm still here\nJust for a minute let me borrow your ear\nMake all your troubles disappear\nBet you never like this here\nLet's pop a bottle bring in the New Year\n\n[Hook: Akon]\nCan I borrow you for a minute?\nMaybe two or five\nMaybe just for the rest of my life\nBorrow you for a minute\nJust us two, it's alright\nIf you decide to be by my side\nI might not give you back\nMight not give you back\nMight not give you back\nIf your here by my side\nMight not give you back\nMight not give you back\n\n[Verse 2: 40 Glocc]\nOne two... minutes\nAll I need to consider\nIf she the right one to get with her\nI'm still the same, want the cash, keep the chain\nShe don't trip\nWon't complain\nTrip to Spain off the plain\nAfter party of the chain\nBack to Cali, off the plain\nBlack Denali swerving lanes\nWith the strap\n\nThree. Minutes, all I need is your name\nNumber to call something to ball\n\n[Hook: Akon]\nCan I borrow you for a minute?\nMaybe two or five\nMaybe just for the rest of my life\nBorrow you for a minute\nJust us two, it's alright\nIf you decide to be by my side\nI might not give you back\nMight not give you back\nMight not give you back\nIf your here by my side\nMight not give you back\nMight not give you back\n\n[Verse 3: 40 Glocc]\nI'm off the chain\nI'm off the chain\nSpecial when I take off the chain\nI'm special\nI can give you special things\nGet you wet without the rain?\nDrop the top blow your brain\nHit the club cop a drink\nIt's Akon he don't drink\nMoney pouring out the bank\nFlip a coin what to take\nOccupate what you make\nWhat you like what you hate\nWhat your type, what you date\nWhere you live, where you stay\nI don't care what your race\n\n[Hook: Akon]\nCan I borrow you for a minute?\nMaybe two or five\nMaybe just for the rest of my life\nBorrow you for a minute\nJust us two, it's alright\nIf you decide to be by my side\nI might not give you back\nMight not give you back\nMight not give you back\nIf your here by my side\nMight not give you back\nMight not give you back\nIf your here by my side girl (more) (less)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7fdb871fc0f0f0caae60fc303f4456b3.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2009-03-17"}], "artist": "40 Glocc"}
