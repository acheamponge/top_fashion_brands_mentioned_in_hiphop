{"artist": "Big Daddy Kane", "songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere's no myth or fable about the pimpin' at your label\nWhat goes on under the table, why you think your deal is so unstable?\nNow, whose the macaroni, A&R's acting phony\nOnce you make the matrimony, then he start to slackin' don't he\nOr could it be the president that's being hesitant\nPlayin' his artist like a corner workin' specimen\nAnd I ain't kidding you when I say it's political\nThe way they make a ridicule of artists can be pitiful\nYou know damn well there shouldn't be no company CO\nTrying to show me about rap that's 53 or so\nBut yet and still they want to add advice, trying to keep their status right\nWhen they should be working records for Gladys Knight\nWho shape artists, man they catching rape charges\nOnce you sign on the dotted line, they lead you in the blind\nThen you find, your state of revenue remains the same\nCause you getting less points than Steve Kerr be getting in a game\nAnd just because it be too hardcore to judge it\nThey won't even touch it, and get to frontin' on the budget\nWhen new artists come out, I can foresee the worst outcome\nCause everybody I know got beat their first album\nSo I took my contract to a lawyer so he can check it out (He don't know)\nThen I took it to Dionne Warwick so she can  read my hand (She don't know)\n\nChorus\nIt's a shame, when artists gotta deal with cheats\nThey got game, for every young rapper they see out on the streets\nYou sign your name, they get like Big Red on the Five Heartbeats\nNow who the blame, when you starvin' and your record label eats\n\n[Verse 2]\nPreach brother\nThey say the truth will set you free, but I see signs of treachery\nGo on perpetually, here's how they get you G\nThey use the tricks, just to juice your mix\nBut cross be in their heart like a vampire stabbed with a crucifix\nI had the enemy in my vicinity with the false identity\nOf a friend to me to injure me\nThey ride along just to guide you wrong\nPlay like they beside you strong, and start to faking moves like Olajuwon\nWho side you on, revealing all that low down dirty dealing\nI can see your skin peeling it changed like a chameleon\nFirst you believe in them, but once you disagree with them\nThey try to get Magilla repertoire and that ain't even them\nAnd all those who has betrayed, be fast to fade\nCause they cast a shade, with the masquerade\nWhat's dealt, is low blows below the belt\nLord have mercy, I know how Julius Caesar must have felt\nI start to think back when I was just a youth\nI should have listened to the words of the God Born Truth\nHe said, \"look out for black snakes they all up in your cypher\nBlack snakes you can't see therefore they sneak up and they bite ya'\"\nThey get to flippin' cause they think you slippin'\nSo remember, don't get to slippin' cause they get to flippin'\nAnd trippin', what's that you grippin', beside your hippin'\nYou think my heart is skippin', go save that game for Scottie Pippen\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's a shame, to see how far left people be going\nThey got game, to think that all this time you said you know them\nIt ain't the same, Aah, so now you see the way they flowin'\nNow who they blame, ain't nothing but a wolf in sheep's clothing\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow, wait a minute, I'm starting to see lotsa, hip-hop imposters\nIs rap a category at the Oscars?\nToo much Nino Brown up in your life\nCause since then, man I done seen Wesley Snipes playin' a drag queen\nBut yet and still you want to mimic the stars of cinema\nPretending huh? So full of it they need an enema\nCause see dig, they all like to talk big\nBut then they want to renege, when there's a curling iron in their wig\nYou talking loud and saying nothing, what's the world becoming?\nThe frontin', now pay attention you may learn something\nNow, I ain't knocking you, but come on let's be logical\nYou know that it's impossible to stop the unstoppable\nI would suggest that they, go back and check my resume\nCause tunes that I made yesterday, can hang out with the best today\nPeace to Easy Mo, cause he makes the beats to flow\nAnd I grab the microphone and flip it like pizza dough\n\n[Chorus]\nShame\nNow who the blame\nI need to be the Mayor, so I can change the things around here\nI need to be the Governor, I need to be the Governor", "image": "https://images.genius.com/55a075f6632f5b5a223681bd3f7a7ca8.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "1998-04-28", "title": "Shame!", "album": "Veteranz Day"}]}
