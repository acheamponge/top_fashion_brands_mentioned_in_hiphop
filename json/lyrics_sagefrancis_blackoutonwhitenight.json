Deal with it\"\nBaby's waiting for a ring\nAnd won't settle for the substitute excuse that's forming\nI've got a complicated case of escapism\nFor her, I tried to rewire my\nNature\nToo tired to wake her\nUp out of that artificial calm she was on\nA drug-induced future that slipped out of her palms\nSeductive rain dancer, she thinks I'm waterproof\nLike Superman doesn't need a roof over his head\nWhen I come home to roost\nI'll need truth to hold in bed\nBut I'm seeking salvation in a booth, and the phones are dead\nAnd the lights are out\nAnd I'm the only thing that's living in this ghost town\nExcept for the clouds\nAnd man, they're coming down\nIf I knew my way around by now, I'd be bound for home\nBlack out on white night in Rome\nBlack out on white night in Rome\n\n[Jolie Holland singing]\n\nI know that I'm in love, but I know I'm out of touch\nAnd I know that I get dumb when I can sense something's up\nAnd then I bottom out\nEuropean tailspin\nScrawling messages out on my pale skin in hopes they get mailed in\nBefore the ink poisoning takes effect\nAnd it gets smudged cause I budge before letting paint set\nI get judged by the ones who have shelter and rain checks\nWhile I trudge through the mud because this foreign terrain's wet\nRegain consciousness, then lose common sense\nThe ominous, dark skies that lie between me and Providence are signs\nThe obvious answer isn't standing on your face with stilettos on\nIf you pop the question wrong\nEvery song's a post afterthought, but I won't grab the chalk\nTo outline my body of work\nToe tags get caught in my teeth cause my foot is in my mouth\nAnd the spurs are in my words, so my tongue can't dismount\nEven after our rapport had fully run its course\nI couldn't figure out the most heroic time to jump from the horse\nAnd place this old hat for the last time on the coat rack\nBut I'd donate all my earnings from the race just to know that\nResisting urges to go back and get it later\nLike the milk would unsour itself in the refrigerator\nA wet boy in a dry, dry state\nOn an old country road where tradition has a blind date\nI'll make it dance on its own grave tonight\nWith a change of direction by the pale moonlight\nAnd if it needs theme music, I'll break out the bagpipes\nPlay a tune you ghostwrote me in a past life that goes like ...\n\n[Jolie Holland singing]\n\nBlack out on white night in Rome\nBlack out on white night in Rome\nBlack out on white night in Rome\nBlack out on white night in Rome", "album": "Human the Death Dance"}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
