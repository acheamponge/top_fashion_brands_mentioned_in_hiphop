For as long as you took\nYou better look like Halle Berry... Or Beyonc\u00e9\nShit, then we getting married\nI brought sand to the beach 'cause my beach is better\nYou can keep ya beach 'cause that beach whatever\nStarted out at The Darby, ended up at 1 Oak\nLeft the house with 100 grand, ended up near broke\nDon't get mad at me, I'm buying bucket after bucket\nWhen it's gone I'm like \"Fuck it\"\nI replace it with another one\nCan't take this money with you\nBurn this shit up like I'm Richard\nNiggas asking \"Is the oven on?\"", "title": "Beach Is Better (Interlude)", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/MCHG_cover.jpg", "year": "2013-07-04", "album": "Magna Carta...
