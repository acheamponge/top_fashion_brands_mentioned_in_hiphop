You know what I'm coming to\nIt's just my point of view\n\n[Q]\nYou gotta readjust the means\nI'll tell you what I mean\nSometimes you gotta work it out\nSometimes you gotta figure it out\n\nYou gotta readjust the means\nI'll tell you what I mean\nSometimes you gotta work it out\nSometimes you gotta figure it out\nYeah, yeah...yeah yeah yeah (reverbs)\n\n[Afu-Ra]\nAnd as we realise life, and what?\nWe gotta suck it in\nAnd are we droppin' some knowledge, or are we frontin' an'?\nYour course in life, no matter how you rub it in\nThere's so many roads, either you strugglin' or bubblin'\n\n[Q]\nYou gotta readjust the means\nI'll tell you what I mean\nSometimes you gotta work it out\nSometimes you gotta figure it out\n\nYou gotta readjust the means\nI'll tell you what I mean\nSometimes you gotta work it out\nSometimes you gotta figure it out\n\nYou gotta readjust the means\nI'll tell you what I mean\nSometimes you gotta work it out\nSometimes you gotta figure it out\n\nYou gotta readjust the means\nTell me what I mean\nSometimes you gotta work it out\nSometimes you gotta figure it out\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah\nOh oh", "title": "Readjustment", "album": "Life Force Radio", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2ab295588bcecbcbb2710f3930d44f59.945x945x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Afu-Ra"}
