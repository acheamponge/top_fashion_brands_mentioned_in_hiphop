Did i do all these things in my brain?\nWas the sling blade curse or was i going insane?\nI ran out the front door and just looked all around\n100 headless corpses' laying all over the ground\n\n(Chorus 2x)\n(Otis)\nGot it in my hands and a feelin' rush though\nAin't nobody know what to do when my sling blade fucks you\nCuts through with a 1,2\nI drop poison on my airplane when i crop dust you\nSee i gotta put food on the table\nAnd give sacrifice to the Gods that i pray to\nAnd that means that nothing can save you\nApologize to Mother Earth for what the humans bring you\nI raise through the fields and chase you\nWith fast pace your back breaks\nWhen the sight takes you\nThen i drag you back by the hair to my shack\nButton up my coat and dissect your throat\nI cut out the flesh the pieces are so big\nI put 'em through a shredder then i feed them to my pig\nAnd i know the job move a little slow\nBut the heart is dissened and imma sweep what we sew\n\n(Chorus till end)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9bc5140eadd19250a34c88748f1ddafa.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
