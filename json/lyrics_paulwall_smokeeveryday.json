(smoke weed everyday) seven roaches in the ashtray.. seem like all i do is pour up and keep blazin..\nPaul wall- \"im high as a cloud, and im floatin like a parade. full of that high grade, i stay on that purple haze. My mind in a daze, i ain't been sober in days, from all punch that i been pourin' and the blunts that i blazed. Remember back in the days,i ain't lean, smoke, or sip. But things changed a bit, now-a-days im lit. See, i started after high school, and now i can't quit. Watchin ol' skool, it taste soo good when it hits the lips. im floatin like the mothership, higher then mars. gone offa couple handle bars, i see stars, gone offa couple loushes, jammin that dude devin, i wonder what pac, and pimp c talkin about in heaven. im flyin in the gorgia down antwan dry, but if the laws catch me swervin, i'll be gone for a ride, feelin' soo good inside, so high indeed, with no sticks, no seeds, just some indo leaves, now breathe..\n\n(chorus X2)\nDevin the Dude- I wake up in the mornin.. pour up a cup of coffee, take a pull on this toffee, now im off to have a good day, blessed to have another one", "year": null}]}
