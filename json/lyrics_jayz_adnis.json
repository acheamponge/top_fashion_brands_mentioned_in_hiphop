{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nUh, letter to my dad that I never wrote\nSpeeches I prepared that I never spoke\nWords on a paper that I never read\nProses never penned, they stayed in my head\nJotted on dotted lines, \"I'ma fight you, nigga\"\nFrom stories that I heard, I'm just like you, nigga\nMust've been some pain in your past, too\nMust've been a karma that was past due\nMust it be the energy that passed through\nMust've been a pastor, many snafus\nStarted a good man, you married my mama\nI was in her belly, you hurried that Summer\nShe had two kids from a previous mister\nOne family, I don't believe in half-sisters\nNever treated my brother like a step, Pop\nRemembered the many lessons when we stepped out\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat was you preparing us\u2014\nFor?\n\n[Verse 2]\nDid you see the runt as the front-runner\nLeader of the pack, you see that in your youngins\nWhat ancestors did you summon to the summit\nTo give me what I needed, what you need to take from 'em\nThe tsunamis that I swum in to become in\nHad the cable with the anchor for the places that I sunk in\nUnc in a better place but you couldn't function\nShot junk in your arms, more than your veins was punctured\nI punted on feelings, 'cause you said you was coming\nYou couldn't kick the habit, I wish you said something\nYou can't avenge these many sins with your own hands\nYou wanna make God laugh, just tell him your plans\nWho would've thought I'd be the dad I never had\nBe the husband I've become, usually nothing come from that\nI forgive you as I live through the beautiful present of the past\nI'm just thankful that I get all these gifts to unwrap\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat was you preparing us\u2014\nFor?", "title": "Adnis", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4cf5f4f88ace021acdc18cc3cefcf2f4.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2017-07-07", "album": "4:44"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
