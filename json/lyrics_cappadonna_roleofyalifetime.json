New York City, the burnt out apartments, the hallways that's gritty\nIt's a pity we livin' this shit, cracks under my dick\nFeel my pain, if you know about this shit\nDope in the toilet, money in the mattress\nWe keep ratchets, and like niggas up north, we fuck a fat bitch\nWe eat octopus too, and we love the catfish\n\n[Chorus: Solomon Childs]\nThe building of the most powerful dynasty\nWe not just any stars, whether you be a murderer\nOr maybe the world just never heard of you\nGo 'head and play it out, this the role of ya lifetime\nThe building of the most powerful dynasty\nWe not just any stars, whether you be a murderer\nOr maybe the world just never heard of you\nGo 'head and play it out, this the role of ya lifetime\n\n[Interlude: Solomon Childs, (Cappadonna)]\nShoot 'em up shit, nigga, shoot 'em up shit, nigga\n(Yeah bitch), yeah all up in your voicebox nigga\n\n[Verse 2: Cappadonna]\nYo, all ya'll bitch ass muthafuckas, ya'll ain't shit\nYou actin' like you can't happen til I pop the clip\nHave your girl suckin' my dick, run in your crib and take chips\nYou don't know me, I don't fuck around with ya'll, homie\nYou can't hold me, fake ass niggas owe me\nBig Don from the group home\nSittin' on the front stoop smokin' a bone\nAll ya'll hatin' ass niggas, get one in your dome\nOr I'm up in the studio, playin' the phone\nI put hits on your fam, dog, now you alone\nSo why you just not popular yet, I grab my tech\nAnd run around the blocks and demand respect\nIt's the who? Nigga, Jay Bird, that's my word\nI leave your body in the dollar van, your brains on the curb\nStaten Island niggas be the most superb\nLaid back in the joint, just be smokin' the herb\n\n[Chorus: Solomon Childs]\nThe building of the most powerful dynasty\nWe not just any stars, whether you be a murderer\nOr maybe the world just never heard of you\nGo 'head and play it out, this the role of ya lifetime\nThe building of the most powerful dynasty\nWe not just any stars, whether you be a murderer\nOr maybe the world just never heard of you\nGo 'head and play it out, this the role of ya lifetime"}]}
