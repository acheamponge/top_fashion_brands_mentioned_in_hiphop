I told you I got you forever\n\n[Chorus: Lil Zay Osama]\nI was locked up, you wasn't wit me, not no calls, not one visit\nNo receipts, not no pictures, I couldn't eat, I wanted friendly's\nRest in peace to my niggas, I'll bleed for my niggas\nAnything for my niggas 9 P, they fuck with me\nI'm with my brothers for lifetime, free my brothers for the right mind\nAnd your brothers ain't like mine, argue don't shoot, won't fight mine\nMade out we ain't got no worries, in the jam don't switch your story\nWhile some ain't there not for me\nMy brothers right here they love me\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Durk]\nWhen he slide for you, gotta get him a lawyer\nReal homicide nigga play with my daughter\nYou was caught in the jam you ain't change the story\nNiggas got mad when I went and signed Tory\nDifferent baby mommas gotta take em' to [?]\nBooka tell me every time, niggas ain't for me\nRide around with my gun cause they niggas be on me\nRide with the vultures we ain't gotta be 4 deep\nFuck them other niggas want the main factor\nIt was crazy when I seen his brain splatter\nHe was talkin' he ain't make it no better\nVlone like em' mixed with margiela's\nHe had to move around cause I know he was jealous\nGot all them guns like that nigga really actin'\nWhy you front your move? Choppa make you move backwards\nAnd you showed the streets your word don't matter, yeah yeah\nBack of the berry, sweeter the juice, 3500 the bigger the booth\nNo Iphone addicted to boost\nAnd I drink me a cup addicted to juice, lean\nAnd I'm still the same nigga by any means\nYou put cap in your rap nigga literally\nNowadays you can't tell a nigga anything\nThem niggas gonna try to remember me\n\n[Chorus: Lil Zay Osama] x2\nI was locked up, you wasn't wit me, not no calls, not one visit\nNo receipts, not no pictures, I couldn't eat, I wanted friendly's\nRest in peace to my niggas, I'll bleed for my niggas\nAnything for my niggas 9 P, they fuck with me\nI'm with my brothers for lifetime, free my brothers for the right mind\nAnd your brothers ain't like mine, argue don't shoot, won't fight mine\nMade out we ain't got no worries, in the jam don't switch your story\nWhile some ain't there not for me\nMy brothers right here they love me\n\nI was locked up, you wasn't wit me, not no calls, not one visit\nNo receipts, not no pictures, I couldn't eat, I wanted friendly's\nRest in peace to my niggas, I'll bleed for my niggas\nAnything for my niggas 9 P, they fuck with me\nI'm with my brothers for lifetime, free my brothers for the right mind\nAnd your brothers ain't like mine, argue don't shoot, won't fight mine\nMade out we ain't got no worries, in the jam don't switch your story\nWhile some ain't there not for me\nMy brothers right here they love me"}], "artist": "Lil Durk"}
