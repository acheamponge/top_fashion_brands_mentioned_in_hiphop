{"songs": [{"title": "Westwood Freestyle(2008)", "lyrics": "[Verse 1 - Akala]\nI set the times like Greenwich meridian\nRhymes good for any terrain, like amphibians\nMr Brazilian, blown to oblivion\nTough guy snivelling when I start chiselling\nRaps on stone tablets like hieroglyphics is\nWriting can\u2019t quite define how my lyrics is\nRhetorical, historical, metaphorical oracle\nCompare to me yo, your son ain\u2019t prodigal\nImpossible to you, to me its quite probable\nI am the one I feel it to my hair follicles\nSo sure, never been a spitter that\u2019s so raw\nThere just about digesting what I was doing in \u201804\nSo \u201908 your late, go get your mate\nCuz, can\u2019t you see, can\u2019t you see I scraped the plate\nI speak truth your booth is a cinema\nYou rap a little, I compose literature\nThat\u2019s very separate like a sket in a celibate\nIntelligence or precedence, I'm a terrible terrorist\nSplit second of hesitance will cost you your residence\nSo what you think is, the top of what is Everest\nCompared to galaxies, that\u2019s when you challenge me\nYour reality is complete and utter fallacy\nSo wrong no matter how you try to prolong\nI stroll on still studying stars like the Dogon\nI\u2019m so gone, couldn\u2019t come back if I wanted to\nMy honest view is the only thing I promise you\nOh and, flow with the wisdom of old mans\nI don\u2019t do seconds like a watch with a broke hand\nYo fam, this is second nature like another earth\nMust see me this year, like another hearse\nNo tug, pussyhole, go grab another purse\nBut please whatever you do, don\u2019t rap another verse\nYou\u2019re not on my level negro please\nHow can you talk to me when you don\u2019t even read\nWhile I, study degrees but attend no classes\nNo profit, just don\u2019t rap about arses\nLike all of you pickneys, no matter who you pick me\nThe HIV MC you can\u2019t live with me\nNor go against me, flow to immense be\nI\u2019m scoring no matter how strong your defence be\nI feel like it\u2019s a race but everybody's walking\nAnd I got 2 speeds, horses, the Porsches\nOf course it's the raw shit, that hit 'em like a horse kick\nForfeit, here's the flow tight as a corset, pause it\nTake a second to think proper\nYou will come a cropper if you ramp with the topper topper!\nDungargan, knock you out like yard rum\nBredrin don't you that my style just can't done\nI know no other way, just can\u2019t stop ascending\nJust like you, just can\u2019t stop pretending\nSilly kids, ain\u2019t you sick of your silly fibs\nReally that scared just to be who you really is\nYour tasting American shit, tongue like brown\nTalking like a tug when you\u2019re as soft as a night gown\nCouldn\u2019t even cut mustard so put the knife down\nYou are not the king you\u2019re just posing with my crown\n\nYou are not the king you\u2019re just posing with my crown\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe saga begins shit escalates so quickly\nRoad so shift get your marrow clap quickly\nPricks chat swiftly, while mandem attack sickly\nJust to think it\u2019s the same kid you stacked chips with\nWent to school with \u2018em, bought your first tool with \u2018em\nNow you\u2019re in the pool riddled with bullets it's not cool\nTrust don\u2019t live here, lust for the chips here\nTo push a pluck shits here\nKids will flip, yeah\nNo discussing your life ain\u2019t worth nothing here\nTurn your bright lights to night lights for bluffing here\nCome on man I don\u2019t play with these kids\nYou can\u2019t reason with a man with no reason to live\nWhat can you prove to a dude who thinks he already dead\nMove food with the kid but he already fed\nEverbody gat [?], back stabbing is black habit\nWe ever stick together now, that will be black magic\nInstead we steady flipping, ready to stick the clip in\nDickheads that get it twisted get lifted like a magician\nThis is the road religion, we cold as a winter blizzard\nBlowing our little triggers and falling our little figures\nBut, on the real cuz we dying inside\nDon\u2019t watch the screw face that we hiding behind\nGo to the box talk to the mandem with time\n9 out of 10 say they wish they could have rewind\nIt's why I can\u2019t stand theses grime kids talking \u2018bout bussing\nPrats can\u2019t even scrap how the hell are you thuggin\u2019\nShit is serious talking about taking a life away\nWe no killers but we play anyway\nPraying away, Stuck in the same fate\nMoving at 100 miles an hour but we stuck in the same place\nIt's hell on earth and they shook they halfway crook\nThey couldn't ramp, couldn\u2019t come where I look\nCouldn\u2019t read what I read, or see what I see\nOr go where I go, or be where I be\nMan ain\u2019t close to Akala, straight off the top harder\nHere with Tim Westwood man they can\u2019t touch it\nThe flow is black Russian, yo\nHave blood rushing\nMan can\u2019t ramp with Akala it's nothing", "year": null, "album": null, "image":
