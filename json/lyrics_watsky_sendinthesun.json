I\u2019m tired now, I\u2019ll go to sleep\nAnd when this is the coldest solstice, maybe folks\u2019ll notice me\n\n[Chorus]\nSend in that sunshine\nMake everything right\nTurn on your love light\nCause baby I\u2019m coming on by\nSend in that sunshine\nMake everything right\nCause there ain\u2019t no suffering in life\nThat don\u2019t ease with the passage of time\n\n[Verse 2]\nGoodbye Maggie, Goodbye Jules\nI wish you\u2019d stuck around, you wise fools\nCause friends they tend to come and go\nThe way the ocean ebbs and flows but there\u2019s reminders in the tide pools\nBut when the standing water\u2019s putrid\nWho am I to say a choice you made was stupid?\nThere\u2019s a bunch of us who loved you\nFucking stuck here pointing fingers at ourselves for something you did\nYou you you you you packed your problems in a suitcase\nYou you you went away forever to a new place\nYou left behind a lot of blue faces and bouquets and loose ends like shoelaces\nBut my friend, it\u2019s too late\nSo all my lightweights and barflies, let\u2019s raise a pint each time a star dies\nAnd toast the memory of hard lives\nFiled on the interstellar hard drives and archives", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0ed2171f9fa650ff0ccb5bcecb02d6f3.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Cardboard Castles", "title": "Send in the Sun"}]}
