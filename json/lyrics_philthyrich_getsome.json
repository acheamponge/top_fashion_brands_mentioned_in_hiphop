"lyrics": "[Intro]\nLegendary Town shit though, boy\nFrom the Ville to Seminary, nigga\nPhilthy, what's happening, boy?\nThe Mekanix\nLook, look, look\n\nI got manpower like ant flowers (Sem City)\nWe was sellin' cocaine before the cam flowers (Off top)\nWe was sellin' heroin, now them Xans hotter\nDan dada, Gucci sweatsuits at the Porsche Tower\nZilla, I go hard in my Goyard\nReal Ville nigga, all G's on my report card (Field Boy)\nI can paint a picture like Mozart that go dark\nSlide on bitch niggas like go-karts, the flow spark\nMy son caught a double homi', got a cold heart\nThat phone call got him callin' shots from the foe yard\nWe vacuum seal it, then send this shit like a postcard\nCool bottle drip, they ride the wave like a coast guard (Touchdown)\nYes, Oakland vet', I was holdin' TEC's\nSlidin' a stolen Lex', sellin' crack soakin' wet\nField Boys pushin' that weight, nigga, like Soloflex\nStolen sets, I bought a tool to bust the Oakland TEC\nThe first on the West with that platinum grill like Big Pun\nThe first with the Rangers TVs, I made you get one\nYou ballin' on an income\nI been stuntin' 20 years and then some\nYou better get up, get out, and get some, Zilla\n\n[Chorus]\nYou better get up, get out, and get some (Get some)\nYou better get up, get out, get some (Get some)\nGet up, get out, get some (Get some)\nYou better get up, get out, get some (Get some)\nGet up, get out, get some (Get some)\nYou better get up, get out, and get some (Get some)\nGet up, get out, get some (Get some)\nYou better get up, get out, get some (Get some)\n\n[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]\nUh-huh, look\nNothin' come to a sleepy nigga but a dream (Uh-uh)\nHealth is wealth, I had to fall back on the lean (I had to)\nRunnin' up these M's way more important (Ayy, run it up)\nHe from the neighborhood but he gettin' extorted (It's Philthy)\nThick bitch, ass fat so it's pokin' out (Bitch)\nI wasn't jokin' back then, I ain't jokin' now (Is that right?)\nTook fifty thou' and opened up a clothing store (Chump change)\nAsk you niggas' net worth, it ain't more than four (It's Philthy)\nYou can flex on the 'Gram 'cause you gettin' scammed (Broke nigga)\nI was eatin' good, nigga, when I was in the can (34 West)\nPuttin' niggas in position so they can feed they family (Oh, I remember)\nI seen niggas true colors, I guess I wasn't family (It's Philthy)\nFifty pointers on this Dre Feddi tombstone (Ayy, rest in peace)\nBust down Submariner, no two-tone (Bust down)\nBeen playin' with this money way before you niggas (Sem City Money Man)\nAnd it'll get a nigga touched, don't make me show you, nigga\nIt's Philthy\n\n[Chorus]\nYou better get up, get out, and get some (Get some)\nYou better get up, get out, get some (Get some)\nGet up, get out, get some (Get some)\nYou better get up, get out, get some (Get some)\nGet up, get out, get some (Get some)\nYou better get up, get out, and get some (Get some)\nGet up, get out, get some (Get some)\nYou better get up, get out, get some (Get some)\n\n[Verse 3]\nDope boy, fresher than fresh\nRock out with my cock out, go dumb on the rest\nOptimist in my prime, rest dressed to finesse\nCatch a chick like a sign, let the ho do the rest\nNo, nigga, yes, rude boy contest\nClose range headshot, shootin' that thing at his vest\nOut here, boy, in the flesh, head up\nTacklin' practice, hittin' rappers, fuckin' it up\nNo punks, suckers get squashed and stepped on\nChoppers come out to wake the game up, who slept on?\nYou step wrong, trick play mine, your leg gone\nGo find another body to put a motherfuckin' head on\nYou dead and gone, when we be on, no turnin' off\nLeavin' the scene cloudy, all that rubber we burnin' off\nYou dead and gone, when we be on, no turnin' off\nLeavin' the scene cloudy, all that rubber we burnin' off\n\n[Chorus]\nYou better get up, get out, and get some (Get some)\nYou better get up, get out, get some (Get some)\nGet up, get out, get some (Get some)\nYou better get up, get out, get some (Get some)\nGet up, get out, get some (Get some)\nYou better get up, get out, and get some (Get some)\nGet up, get out, get some (Get some)\nYou better get up, get out, get some (Get some)\n\n[Verse 4: Dru Down]\nI used to grind on the block\nFour-eght slide, six-nine, sellin' rocks\nHigh Street to Seminary, very scary\nBullet holes and bullets will fill the cemetery\nThe white fence, a little house on the fuckin' prarie\nNigga, we got on\nBaby projects turfed up, nigga, hello\nMy neighbors shoot me but they call me Dru\nMy last name Down, it came with the town, woo\nI carry the two-four-fives in my Levis\nAnd I was only 15, nigga, knee high\nAnd I'll sting you like a bee out a beehive\nSometimes we on the news, Channel 2, we live\nEast Oakland where the tides be smokin'\nTop show with a bad ho, break it up, po-po\nAnd then we skeet-skrrt, back to the teaser\nWhere we get all the dough from the wheezer\nAnd now I'm throwin' up the fingers in her thong\nAnd I ain't wavin' bye, sucker, this the five\nAnd I'm a pimp, I don't pimp 'til I pass out\nReal nigga here, lil' boy, check the background\nEast Oakland\n\n[Chorus]\nYou better get up, get out, and get some (Get some)\nYou better get up, get out, get some (Get some)\nGet up, get out, get some (Get some)\nYou better get up, get out, get some (Get some)\nGet up, get out, get some (Get some)\nYou better get up, get out, and get some (Get some)\nGet up, get out, get some (Get some)\nYou better get up, get out, get some (Get some)", "year": "2019-05-31"}]}
