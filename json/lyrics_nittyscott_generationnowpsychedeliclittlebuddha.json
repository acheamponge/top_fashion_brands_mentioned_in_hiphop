Here's Tom with the weather\n\n[Intro]\n\n[Verse 3: Nitty Scott]\nIf every eight year old was taught meditation\nI think we have peace for an entire generation\nSet the times ablaze, we do it in waves\nAnd be brave like ancestors on slave ships for days\nStomach churning because the world is burning\nAnd we inhaling the second hand, but I got a second plan\nCarry the comradery to continents\nWe don't need religion cause we got our consciousness -ness\nAnd I ain't just an optimist\nNew earth is coming ain't no stopping this\nSay goodbye to buy consume die\nAll my realized beings will spread wings and fly\n\n[Outro]\nThat we are all one consciousness experiencing itself"}], "artist": "Nitty Scott"}
