Riots are reported in\nLondon and the United Nations is calling for an emergency meeting\n\nVerse 1:\nA-Yo back in the day I sold hand to hand crack\nEscapin' jail all day to get my money back\nStarving' so bad that my stomach touched my back\nAnywhere that I went yo I didn't know how to act\nOh his chain is phat\nFuck that snatch that flash the gat\nWhen all I really wanted to do was rap (1,2 y'all)\nI've been preparing for this moment for years so step back\nCla clack take that catch a heart attack\nI am the illest MC on the streets today\nBut fans say wack rappers shouldn't come my way\nBut I say\nI destroy crews like an AK\nWell OK please explain why you talk this way\nCause you can sell a million records and be wack (word up)\nYou can have mad skills and don't sell jack\nIt got my brain racin', heart pacin', fightin' incarceration\nOn the Internet in front of the whole nation\nIn front of the judge with a grudge and no budge\nAnd no love\nThat's how it is when you a thug\nIf push comes to shove I rise above\nAnd stay dedicated to rap like ghetto love\n\nHook\n\"Ooh street life there's a thousand parts to play\nStreet Life. Until you play your life away ooow\"\n\nVerse 2:\nMe and my peeps on the creep deep like sleep\nHip in heat in the seat of the jeep\nThe more I try to get out the more I realize I can't\nSo I roll with the beat and sing the war chant\nThe power and the struggle in the concrete jungle\nAnd the troubles in the rubbles of the brothers on the bubble\nAnd yeah I heard your story your fuckin' niggas bore me\nOn how you goin' out in the blaze of glory\nYou ask Joe you sad as John Doe\nYou can fool some heads but the real niggas know (word up)\nNiggas try to get on the mic with no skills\nI got one question for you\nHow that shit feel?\nYou feel you keepin' it real but you fake as a three dollar bill\nMy grandmother has more skill\nMy man A+ put the bug in my ear\nBut don't make me open that door and have to go there\nBecause...\n\nHook\n\nVerse 3:\nTruethfully I went from havin' nothing to eat\nTo eatin' a feast\nI went from chillin' on the streets to livin' in phat suites\nI went from a twenty four hour day crime wave\nTo workin' in the studio with me gettin' paid\nAnd it ain't no mystery people know the history behind me\nAnd if you don't ask somebody on the street\nBut Murray never worry the girls love me very\nMake a hit record quick fast in a hurry\nTotal captivation domination with conversation\nThat'll be talked about by the younger generation\nRemedial MCs will always implement violence\nThat's because they ain't got no talent\nSo I suggest you rest and learn about the heart in your chest\nNever the less fuck who's bein' the best\nMore small rappers unite for world peace (word up)\nAnd take back our streets yo\n\nHook"}], "artist": "Keith Murray"}
