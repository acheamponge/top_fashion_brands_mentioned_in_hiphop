I guess\nNo excuse for the troops or the youth\nIf you can\u2019t bring change what\u2019s the use?\nI expect those in a vest, badge on their chest to respect those they put in check\nOr at least please be professional at the most\nTake it slow\nAll these funeral processionals\nI\u2019m tired of that, tired of that\nWhere I live\nWhere I live\nThey swear they don\u2019t care to kill\nBut this time around we should turn it all around\nRight now, right now\n\n[Chorus]\nI know that we can do this better\nThis time around (3x)\nI know\nDo it better, yeah (2x)\nThis time around (3x)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI see a little bit of you in me\nA little bit of me in you\nDon\u2019t let me go\nDon\u2019t let me go astray\nI believe that we were meant to\nMeant to be kings and queens\nDo you, do you believe\nI need to just breathe\nIf you could only see\nThat we were meant to\nThat we were meant to be kings and queens\n\n[Chorus]\nI know that we can do this better\nThis time around (3x)\nI know\nDo it better, yeah (2x)\nThis time around (3x)\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I know it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\nAnd I know it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s you\nYou can open your eyes, see what\u2019s inside you\nI just believe\nYes I believe\nOh I believe in you and me\nThis time around"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
