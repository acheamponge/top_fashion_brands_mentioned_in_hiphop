What how? It ain't that easy pal\nIm nickatina andre seen ya feel my drug lifestyle yeah\nMake money big baby\nNo bitch that ain't my baby\nI wore a Jimmy hat that day see\n\nAnd we only fucked once is you crazy\nSo like a titanic if you panic you is guaranteed to sink\nI make scrilla like a brink I?m rare like a mink\nSo like a picture-perfect moment, nigga say cheese\nWhy do I keep runnin if 5-0 say freeze\nFresh adidas creep across the bathroom floor\nAnd never underestimate a sexyass whore nigga"}]}
