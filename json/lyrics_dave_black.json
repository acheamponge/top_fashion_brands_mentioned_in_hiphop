They're in love with it\nThey take our features when they want and have their fun with it\nNever seem to help with all the things we know would come with it\nLoud in our laughter, silent in our sufferin'\nBlack is bein' strong inside and facing defeat\nPoverty made me a beast, I battled the law in the streets\nWe all struggled, but your struggle ain't a struggle like me\nWell how could it be when your people gave us the odds that we beat?\nI mean, fuckin' hell, what about our brothers that are stuck in jail?\nThat couldn't bust a bell, they held a bird and gotta live with it\nBlack is bein' guilty until proven that you're innocent\nBlack is sayin', \"Free my fucking niggas stuck inside in prison cells\"\nThey think it's funny, we ain't got nothin' to say to them\nUnconditional love is strange to them; it's amazin' 'em\nBlack is like the sweetest fuckin' flavour, here's a taste of it\nBut black is all I know, there ain't a thing that I would change in it", "year": "2019-02-22"}], "artist": "Dave"}
