Chill!'\nDidn't have your steel, now you get your cap peeled\nThis is our life, our life\n\n[Verse 2: Ill Bill]\nAyo, I grew up in the motherfucking projects\nMy moms says if my pop left\nWe would have to get a section-8 apartment\nThe rent's cheap, I see Decepticons at least\nTen deep, run up on me flipping, wanna set beef\nThat was some faggot shit, me and my brother\nWent for do-lo\nThe only 2 white kids up in my projects that wasn't homo\nI fought every day, beefed with a hundred cats\nWay before I started sold drugs and busting caps\nWay before I bust my first nut, I love to rap\nAt 10 years old is when I first started to fuck with that\nEveryone else in my PJ's who'd rhyme was black\nI kept it to myself, continued to define my craft\nI used to buy my mother milk dragging a spike bat\nYou fought with me, I was the type of cat to fight back\nI lace you with a broken nose, holding the ice pack\nWhites, blacks, Puerto Rican's, we was poor, it was wack\nMy mom's tried her best\nI never graduated high school I learned to pump drugs and pack 9's instead\nBecame one of those violent heads\nHave you on a respirator, even though the doctor know your mind is dead\n\n[Hook x2]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5035cd900550d88d5595b3cb2f1eb442.800x800x1.jpg", "album": "Howie Made Me Do It", "year": "2003-09-16"}]}
