Fuck it\nCop yay from Jay, the bricks come with Louis Vuitton luggage\n\n[Fabolous]\nIn my 'hood the slower you move the quicker they get you\nSometimes it's somebody in the click that be with you\nThat's why my vest is thicker to get through\nAnd I keep two nine's on my shirt like Dickerson's shit do\nI waste my breath when I'm bickering with you\nI'd rather waste my techs till they flicker and hit you\nYou sick as my shit blue\nAnd you ain't goin' nowhere for a while, a commercial where Snickers'll fit you, fucker\n\n[Game]\nAin't nothin' but a gangsta party when I'm spittin' to Pac\nThe paint fall off your Miss King when I'm spittin' the Glock\nBefore I was sixteen I was liftin' a drop\nSpittin' on cops, pitchin' the rock\nLike Charlie Ward before the New York Knicks\nNow you can catch me in Brooklyn with Fab on a New York bitch\nWhile you old niggas in rehab\nAnd if I can't be a hip hop legend I'll just die in a ski mask\n\n[Fabolous]\nWhen a gangsta like me ride it be suede in it, be shade tinted\nTires got the rims that Spree made in it\nOne of the prettiest hoes be laid in it\nBlowin' the kid faster than prepaid minutes\nI'm guessin' these haters don't know I keep the Wes in the ators\nFully loaded with the vest penetrators\nBut if they want it, y'all can get it\nYou love the way the coaster coast chiefs did it"}]}
