Period]\n\n[Verse]\nDon't even ask how the high feel\nAsk how do I feel, probably how the sky feel\nJokers is coming in sideways like a sidefill\nThe grapes of wrath intertwined like a vine still\nPhysically I'm ill, walking through a minefield\nWith a straw sticking out a Molotov cocktail\nTwenty one grams of soul on a rock scale\nProbably burn like flaming coals on a hot grill\nYo, if the afterlife is absolutely not real\nThen you diminish and you're finished, it's a done deal\nBeyond that, my heartbeat is like a drum still\nIt's like I'm living on the run with the gun still\nWell, bring the hero back, he's taking care of that\nCause his words get at the Ginsbergs and Kerouacs\nIt's all stuck inside your head like it's ear wax\nWhole scene something out of Hollywood, Miramax\nHush, yo, don't nobody say a flocking word\nJust put the sign on the door, the Do Not Disturb\nI'm bout to show these people how to kill a mockingbird\nYou hit his whole network, like Mark Zuckerberg\nYour witnesses confirm that gunshots occurred\nApparently the triggerman smokes lots of herb\nAnd he could bring your demise disguised as a word\nBut guarantee that be the last one you ever heard\nYou deaf, dumb, and blind\nI'm emphasized like I'm underlined\nMy definition is, I'm undefined\nCause I'm one of a kind, at the top of the line\nAt the top of the food chain when it come to the rhyme\nAnd I'm cynical cause I'm at the pinnacle\nJokers is ridiculous, they the ones I ridicule\nIf somebody acting like they want it, I'mma get at dude\nHave 'em in the middle of the drama like an interlude\nYeah, they weigh a buck ten, soaking wet, fuck them\nYo, I don't need new friends, I can't trust them\nYou best keep a weapon like a shirt tail, tucked in\nBecause I'm taking niggas out like Huck Finn\nThis news just in: mass destruction, boy\nPresented to you by Black Inc. productions\nYeah, righteous hustling, trife corruption\nLook how these OGs with the mics is muscling\nI fight for justice, but minus the red cape\nDollar short, year late, suckers is scared straight\nThey know I'm hotter than a box where the bread bake\nAnd brought J. Period to cut through the red tape"}], "artist": "Black Thought"}
