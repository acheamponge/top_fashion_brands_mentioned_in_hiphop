Use your conscious\nYou want sight? Create a content\nYour diction must create friction\nSparking thoughts as they listen\nTo enlighten someone confused\nWatch it burn down to where the thoughts stems from\nIt's like a pen when it goes into a gun\nFrom within, explode, then it's done\nIt lights like the glow of the sun\nImploding the black dot\nThen explode or blow to a hole to a black spot\nThis friction cause a resistance\nWhich is the cause of all existence\nThese laws are Scientifics, so pay attention\nThe method I use, connected by tubes, digest it like food\nI complexed it for fools, they can't keep the message or jewels\nI left it for you, place the record on spools\nNow the speed is 33 seconds per move\nAnd rotation, that's the globe creation\nLight up the whole nation as motivation\nThe sky had streaks of white fire\nThe angry cloud noise, entices the writer\nMystique alphabet, brightens his eyes up\nThe syllables connect, his eyes become fire\nLike the Messiah, he begins to talk in a rhythm like tension\nGrabbing the mic from outta the dimension\nHe begins spitting, split atoms\nThe rhythm had 'em in a trance\nThe rhythm enhance, his sentence advance\nTill he begins to look like a lamp\nHis head grew incredible, impregnable\nImpossible, what letters could do\nIt put me in a pedestal, Priest of Nazareth\nI came back like Lazareth\nSpread havoc with the magic gift"}]}
