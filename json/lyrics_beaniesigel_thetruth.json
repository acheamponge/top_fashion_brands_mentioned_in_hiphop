Sigel with that arsenic flow\nFuck that, don't hold me back\nI roll with crack, y'all cats told Mac to rap\nY'all don't realize y'all released the beast untame\nSpeech all flame, streets y'all blame\nIt should be an honor for y'all to speak my name\nI could go before your honor sit and peep my game\nGotta laugh, y'all acted like it spit it the same\nWhy you motherfuckers can't get in the game\nI come from high school, and go straight to the league\nWho you know who can spit at the Sig\n\n[Hook]\nNigga the truth, every time I step in the booth\nI speak the truth, y'all know what I'm bringing to you\nI bring the truth, you motherfuckers know who I be\nI be the truth, what I speak shall set you free\nNigga the truth\n\n[Verse 2: Beanie Mac]\nAin't nothin changed with Sig I'm still stuck in the kitchen\nSo what I'm signed, that's fine still stuck in position\nYou motherfuckers know me well, couple court cases from jail\nCouple 4-4 shells from hell\nStuck on this mission, go home, my girl fussin and bitchin\nMotherfucker won't you change your life, I'm thinkin\nMotherfucker won't I change my wife\nIgnorant bastard laughin like fuck the rap shit\nIt's just another hustle, another way for niggas to touch you\nNow they know the face of Beans\nNow they, see my face on screens and I ain't even chase this dream\nI feel sorry for those who did\nY'all niggas can't stop the BOL, whether rock or raw\nI'm slingin coke in a Roc velour\nYou niggas know what block I'm on, Glock in palm\nYou wanna get shot, karate chopped or stabbed this song\nMotherfucker\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Beanie Mac]\nBlack Friday management, and Roc's the label\nAnd I still hit you niggas with shots that's fatal\nThat bullshit vest can't save you\nI had a doc open you up from chest to navel\nSee my face on cable, and have flashbacks of that cold ass table\nAnd them hoes I gave you\nI'm that nigga that'll come and pour salt in your wound\nAt the hospital, while the cops guardin your room\nYou gotta see what I've seen, look where I've looked\nTouch what I've reached, and take what I've took\nYou gotta go where I've gone, walked where I've walked\nTo get where I'm at to speak what I've talked\nYou gotta lay where I've laid, stay where I've stayed\nPlay where I've played to make what I've made\nYou gotta move what I've moved, use what I used\nUse tools how I use, use fools how I use\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a5d876dd3d88aa58a26a93ff8e32c391.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2000-02-29", "title": "The Truth", "album": "The Truth"}]}
