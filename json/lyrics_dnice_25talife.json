{"songs": [{"lyrics": "It was a hot summer day, I was dyin from the heat\nWalkin up 118th street\nAlthough I'm hot like stew\nIn the back of my mind it was a bottle of brew\nNow a ice cold bottle would just quench my thirst\nOr get some boom from the dread, which ever one comes first\nNow is it brew? (yeah) or is it boom? (yeah)\nSo I lit up the boom and now may I presume? (yeah)\nNow about 3 o'clock I had to meet my crew\nI looked at my watch and then I noticed it was half past 2\nI saw these two honeys walkin down the avenue\nAnd one of them said: all I think about is havin you\nNow in my mind I realized I coulda took her, coulda took her\nBut Nice is not the one to treat the ladies like a hooker\nDon't mean to diss, but it's not on my list\nSo I gave her a kiss and said: ehm, good-bye, miss\nFrom the streets I heard a horn beep\nThere was a crew 4 deep in a dark blue jeep\nI heard em speak, he said: my ride is fat\nSo why you're sweatin D-Nice, baby, he ain't all that\nNow first things first, why all the rude behaviour\nYou shoulda been taught how to respect this flavor\nHe jumped out the jeep like yo, what up chief\nBut I don't eat pork, so I guess he wanted beef\nI realized I was on my own\nI didn't proceed to make a move until a blow was thrown\nHe swung but missed, I caught him with a fist\nAlthough I wish it didn't have to come to this\nI started breakin him down with the speed, had him astounded\nThe right caught his jaw and it sounded\nLike boom boom bap boom bam\nHe had no idea that D was nice with his hands\nHe stepped back, so I thought he was through\nBut right about now up steps his crew\nWe all threw down and went round for round\nI'm givin it all I had to give until I fell face down\n\nThey proceeded to stomp but in all of the madness\nSomehow someway I was damn sure glad this\nPerson slid me a pistol from behind\nNot the weasel, pop-pop-pop goes the 9\nSo if you're wonderin why you ain't heard word of them\nI (murder them murder them)\nBut since I pulled the trigger I guess I have to pay the price\nPushin 25 to life", "album": "To Tha Rescue", "year": "1991-01-01", "title": "25 Ta Life", "image": "https://images.genius.com/47aa289708e00aeac7d5e07a8398670b.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "D Nice"}
