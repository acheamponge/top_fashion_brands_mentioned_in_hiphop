I'd rather ride a tram\nThe young silhouette, singing away\nNow with the image set, killin' a bass so I can give you a taste\nAnd have you tappin' feet, movin' with some goosebumps\nAnd make your spine tingle, groovin' to the smooth drums\n\n[Chorus]\nDa da da da da da da\nStay doin' the funky bedroom jammin'\nStay doin' the funky bedroom\nThe funky bedroom, the funky bedroom jammin'\nDa da da da da da da (Hahaha, yeah)\nStay doin' the funky bedroom jammin'\nWe keep the soul bangin'\nAnd keep the soul bangin' and keep the soul bangin' away\n\n[Verse 2]\nAyo, I lead stop, live in the spotlight\nAnd go to any measurement you know I want high\nThe melody raps, I'm tellin' these cats\nIrrelevant facts and takin' all their elements back\nHa, the young dude that'll laugh a lot\nIt's sort of funny that it's hard to stop, man, I'm hard to top\nI stay livin' in a life that's so care-free\nBut don't dare me ever to vote fairly\nNever be broke, barely make enough to survive\nAnd that don't bother me at all, I'm still lovin' this life\nI still love what I write, havin' fun on the mic\nI still make enough money for a son and a wife\nYou know I'm somethin' to find because I'm one of a kind\nI kill that rhythm and tilt back the mission\nFor another day (yeah) I'm encouraging a noisy time\nTake the breaks off people, and enjoy the ride\n\n[Chorus]\nDa da da da da da da\nStay doin' the funky bedroom jammin'\nStay doin' the funky bedroom\nThe funky bedroom, the funky bedroom jammin'\nDa da da da da da da (Hahaha, yeah)\nStay doin' the funky bedroom jammin'\nWe keep the soul bangin'\nAnd keep the soul bangin' and keep the soul bangin' away\n\n[Outro]\nSkip, bap, boobidy bap bap bap\nSkippety bap bap bap bap bap\nSkippety, bippety, bippety, bippety\nBeep bap, boodoo, beep bap ba-boodoo (ha ha, yeah)\nStay doin' the funky bedroom jammin'"}]}
