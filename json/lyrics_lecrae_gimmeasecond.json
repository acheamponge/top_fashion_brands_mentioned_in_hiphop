That must be the way you flow\u2014no\nI talk reality like momma on her death bed\nThe birth of a child, a soldier losin' his left leg\nWho gon' write songs to give him hope in his chair?\nAddicted to pain killers, wife left last year\nYour favorite rapper was prolly tryna make his next hit\nTalkin' look at what I got, who I shot, and who I tipped\nCouldn't be more common if them boys made sense\nCouldn't be more common if Serena was they chick\nAnd this is not a diss, this how reality sound\nLet it off my mind, this how my mentality sound\nYeah!\n\n[Chorus]\nEverything I do, I do it for you\nI don't want a single thing, I don't want a single thing\nAin't got no kind of angle, I ain't tryna play\nYou ain't gotta know my name, you ain't gotta know my name\nBut in my short time on this Earth\nI done died, been rebirthed and I know this sounds strange to you\nSo give me a lil' time, let me spit a couple lines and I promise\u2014\nIt might just change you too, change you too\n\n[Verse 2]\nI sound like the mad rapper 'cause I'm crazy\nThe radio be like, \"We love you,\" but they never play me\nAnd I be doin' shows like, \"You ain't even gotta pay me\"\nI just wanna spread the same message that done saved me\nYou see, I prolly grew up just like you\nTellin' my heroes, \"Man, I wanna be just like you\"\nI got in trouble, went to court\nJudge showed me couple inmates and he told me, \"Man, they started off just like you\"\nI never rolled around strapped, I was busy chasin' girls and money\nI played ball and smoked weed, thought the world was funny\nI went to church a few times, with my head on a swivel\nAnd I was lookin' for the bad ones that sat in the middle\nI couldn't remember a sermon, I never caught the Spirit\nAnd if Christians was tryna rap, man, I'm not tryna hear it\nI never would've imagined that I'd be rhymin'\nAbout the same God that I couldn't confide in\nNever planned to get married, raise a family, help kids grow up\nVisit people in prison, I was busy tryna blow up\nBut see, now I'm unimpressed with the way these folks dress\nOr the engine in they trunk, all I want is soul rest\nAnd I'm so blessed, look at what He did to me\nHow could I keep this to myself? Somebody bled for me\nNah, you just gon' have to hate this\n'Cause God's the only reason that I'm able to say this\nSo play this\n\n[Chorus]\nEverything I do, I do it for you\nI don't want a single thing, I don't want a single thing\nAin't got no kind of angle, I ain't tryna play\nYou ain't gotta know my name, you ain't gotta know my name\nBut in my short time on this Earth\nI done died, been rebirthed and I know this sounds strange to you\nSo give me a lil' time, let me spit a couple lines and I promise\u2014\nIt might just change you too, change you too"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
