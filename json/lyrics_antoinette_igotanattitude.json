Don't mean to harness the charm\nDom Perrignon in the arm, duck alert the alarm\nI'm not braggin or boastin, don't wanna be rude\nBut sad sorry-looking Sallys keep tellin' I got an attitude\n\nYou wanna know why I play you like that? I don't like your face\nTake your running shoes off, you ain't in this race\nKick back, sit back, step off, sit down and be numb\nFeed crumbs to bums, rock rhymes over drums\nIt ain't complicated, must I break it down?\nDef rhymes from a lady with a real live sound\nMust admit it I'm with it so get with it, you dig?\nFlossin carat and gear, and real hair, not a wig\nBodily I'm vivacious and vocally gracious\nAntoinette's put together in all the right places\nFit to carry wit, makin hit after hit\nNever ask me to quit cause I'm eternally lit\nYou ain't ready, baby, sorry Sally, this is my thing\nA lot of male vocalists can't even hang\nAnd if they sound like a sissy when they diss they just piss me\nOff, I get wild and on the mic I get busy\nBold just like a bee, I'm the queen of this thing\nRock a beat inside out like Whitney can sing\nClear my throat, hit a note, ( ? ) and bruised\nYou run circles with my words, I finds and loose\nYa, run your ( ? ) to the edge, you must be on qualudes\nDon't be comin in my face ( ? ) sayin I got an attitude", "year": "1987-01-01"}]}
