The boy in the plastic bubble\nWhen I drink away the pain I guzzle\nMy life is like a complicated mathematical puzzle, for real\nSeen death twice, it's ugly motherfucker man\nBut you conversate with him when you suffering\nHe said, \"Let go of the pain, you'll never rock the mic again\nYour choice, slug to the brain or 20 Vicodin\"\nI kinda likened it to Ortho Tri-Cyclen\nDisturbing the natural cycles of life and it's trifling\nFuck what you heard, less money more problems\n4 years removed from the game with no album\nI put the gun to my brain, but first I wrote a note to explain\nPut the Luger in my head, and these are the words that I said\n\n[Hook]\nSure as kingdoms rise the same kingdoms will surely fall\nAnd wash away like memories, as if they weren't there at all\nLike broken limbs of trees that's lost its leaves to Winter's wind\nSpring will come again..\nLive...\nLive...\nLive...\nLive\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen your cerebral ceases to administer solace\nAnd the only Faith you have left is a CD\nFrom a singer who had a son with Christopher Wallace\nTomorrow is never\nHope is abolished\nMind and soul have little to no unity\nLife threw a brick through my window of opportunity\nMy immune system lacked diplomatic immunity\nWhen asthma attacks the black community\nWhere do you go from there?\nLong walk, short pier\nThought I knew all it was just to know of the ledge\nTill I glanced down at all ten toes on the ledge\nBefore I heard what sounded to me like a pledge\nEmerged from the darkness, and this is what it said\n\"Do not despair, breathe, fight\nFor there is more life to live, believe\nMore insight to share, retrieve\nMust dare to be illustrious\nExhale, hold, inhale, receive and live...\nLive...\nLive...\nLive...\"\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2014-04-15"}]}
