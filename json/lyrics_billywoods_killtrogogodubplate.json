Both play close like\nLovers, brothers play the house like baby mothers.  Easy\nBake Oven stuffers, windbreakers, handcuffers\nFor taillights and mufflers.  billy don\u2019t sleep like\nTruckers.  No darts, I\u2019m a spearchucker\nEnemy competent, licking anthrax letters to Uncle Tom\n\u2018Cause Powell should know better.  Ashcroft and Cheney\nLike, \u201cThat\u2019s my nigga.\u201d  (For real) [?]\nPull the trigger (For real), have her spinning in her grave\n\u2018Cause nothing\u2019s more disgusting than happy slaves.  Lend an ear\nTo these Van Gogh skills, paint spills.  My flow\nLike, \u201cGive me the pill.  Stand back or make the high-\n-light reel.\u201d  This how I feel: people need hot\nMeals.  They\u2019re spending millions spraying coca fields\nBut, in my building, niggas still deal, and\nThe price keeps dropping, so more niggas start copping, get locked\nBack to sharecropping, private prison selling stock\nOptions Rockefeller concoctions, so when the page\nCheck my mouth, grab my balls, I know they\u2019re just shopping\nAuction-blocking.  Where the fuck is Cochran?\nWhere the fuck is Cochran?\n\n[Verse 3: billy woods]\nDie City dub plate\nF the jakes.  Been in Rome, where broken dreams\nGo, Verona Drive, youth in the street, Georgia\nAve., [?], Columbia Heights rock\nReal pipe, Indian Lane tick tock, flying\nLick different cops.  [?]\nThe forest.  Fuck the tourist on the creep\nYou Street, First Street.  E-Double got\nThe leather seats, Marmaduke cheffed it, no meat\nFalafel beats"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
