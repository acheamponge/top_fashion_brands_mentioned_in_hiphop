'cause I gotta be honest, I don't really much approve of you dating in your condition.. that's kinda messed up..\"\n\"No dad, it's not\"\n\"I mean that's pretty skanky.. isn't that what you girls call it skanky? skeevy?\"\n\"Please stop\"\n\"Tore up from the floor up?\"\n\"That's just not what it's about... I just need to know that it's possible that two people can stay happy together forever\"\n\"Well, it's not easy, that's for sure.\"\n\n[Hook: Lil Peep]\nWe could run away\nLeave this little town\nIf you had to wait, would you stick around ?\nWe are not the same, if you couldn't tell\nIt's just another day in this little town, leave this little town\nWe could run away\nLeave this little town\nIf you had to wait, would you stick around ?\nWe are not the same, if you couldn't tell\nIt's just another day in this little town, leave this little town\n\n[Outro]\n*Instrumentally*"}], "artist": "Lil Peep"}
