Mornin\u2019 Stoned Pimp", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nBlack chick, white guy\nDoes it mean shit, maybe\nI don't know, but yo it never phased me\nBut either way here's one tale\nOf two like that and what prevailed\nIt started way back in the 8th grade\nIn the small old town where the two both stayed\nHe came from a family of middle class\nWhere everything he did he always had to ask\nShe came from a place that was so alone\nYou know the same old tale of a broken home\nHer mama was an alkie and more like a friend\nHad three different kids from three different men\nAnd that's just the way shit was\nCouldn't change it, couldn't rearrange it, so there it was\nAnyway the two kept on\nWith the phone calls notes, and so on and so on\nAnd after the bullshit and what'nt\nThat day came when the two started fucking\nAll the time, you know kid's habits\nEvery single day fucking like rabbits\nSneaking out the car when he was 15\nClimbing in the window and fucking all night, see\nFucking after lunch in the junior high bathrooms\nDrinking champagne and tripping on mushrooms\nHis dick was metal, her pussy was a magnet\n9th grade came:  \"I'm pregnant\"\nShit got frantic and man, Oh Lord\nIt was a tough decision but they decided to abort it\nIt might've been right, it might've been wrong\nBut one thing's for sure, it really fucked his head up\nWhere is it, who is it, how is it, was it right\nThese are the things he thought in bed at night\nA lot of people might laugh at this\nBut fuck 'em, they don't know the half of it\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't no sunshine when you're low, I'm low\nPeople tell me life's a game I'm not playing\nBitches don't mean shit to me anymore\nI have taken my blows, I'm still standing\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow as time went on the the two kept on\nThey kept seeing each other off and on\nSee, she moved to the city and you know what happened\nBlack chick with a real white accent\nPretty girl in the ghetto, go figure\nYeah she got macked by some dope dealing nigga\nStill seeing that other kid on the side\nShe kept most of her thoughts inside\nSee all the first guy did was just love her\nWhile that punk motherfucker used to beat her and punch her\nShe was living all wild\nI think all she ever wanted was the love of her own child\nShe asked the first guy to have his baby\nHe looked at her like she must be crazy\nHe was making records and going on tour\n20,000 people hip-hopping on the floor\nAnd all that, while she sat at home and got macked\nIf she stepped out of line she got slapped\nAnd then one day she prayed to the Lord to take that guy away\nAnd he did he got caught with a loaded gun\nAnd went to jail but first she had his son\nOoh, and now what to do\nShe had no man, no money, and no clue\nNow the other guy came back from touring\nAnd she called him up early one morning\nThey hooked up, her mind was blown\nAs he began to raise her son as his own\nAnd that's a lot of shit to deal with man\nAnd if you ain't been there you wouldn't understand\nAnd people still laugh at this shit\nFuck 'em, they don't know the half of it\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't no sunshine when you're low, I'm low\nPeople tell me life's a game I'm not playing\nBitches don't mean shit to me anymore\nI have taken my blows, I'm still standing\n\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow for the next year there was some good times\nA few bad times, mostly good times\nSee he was a rambling man to the bone\nHe liked women and wine and he loved to roam\nNot like she was any kind of saint\nSee in this story there's a lot of red paint\nBut time kept slipping and made her crazy\nAnd she talked about having another baby\nThe guy was like, \"Oh, Lord\"\nWe got one now that we can't afford\nBut she convinced she could handle even two\nSaid, \"I want your child or I'm leaving you\"\nI can't figure out why then he didn't run\nI guess he was attached to her and her son\nAll confused about what to do\nThat girl met another guy and was fucking him too\nSlut\nCould barely pay her rent\nAnd then the same old shit, \"I'm pregnant\"\nAnd if that ain't some shit, cuz\nThe girl didn't even know who the father was\nAnd still by her side the first guy stayed\nHead getting more fucked by the day\nHe stuck it out for nine months, I don't know why\nAnd then a little girl on the Fourth of July\nWas born in the front seat of his car\nIt was amazing\nKind of like a shooting star\nHe was happy, told his family and friends\nOnly to realize later his little girl wasn't his\nAnd that crushed him quick\nSuicidal thoughts were in his head real thick\nBut before he found all that out\nFrom the same chick, another kid popped out\nAnd that shit's real ill\nGirl told him that she was taking the fucking pill\nShe must have known all along\nThe little girl wasn't his and she was trying to latch on\nThree different kids from three different men\nHistory repeats itself again\nAnd after some more shit got stirred\nHe kicked that bitch to the curb\nAnd now from her he's got a little boy\nThat makes him laugh a bit\nAnd he loves him\nBut still, you don't know the fucking half of it\n\n[Chorus]\nAin't no sunshine when you're low, I'm low\nPeople tell me life's a game I'm not playing\nBitches don't mean shit to me anymore\nI have taken my blows, I'm still standing"}]}
