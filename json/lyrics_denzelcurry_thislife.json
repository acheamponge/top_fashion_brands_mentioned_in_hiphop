I would think you were mine\nYou were a part of me, pardon me, parts of me died\nIdolized you when I didn\u2019t unite\nYou won't tell for the moment, but time will tell, but as of now\n\n[Chorus]\nYou didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed\nNot the same since my younger days, so far I came\nFeel my pain till I can't complain, cause I'ma slide for a minute\nTill I rise in the business, make a billion, show my niggas what up\nIn this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 9 to 5\nI keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie\nI'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die\nYou down, then would you ride for me?\nBecause this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me\nYou are my main and as my main you'd better not lie to me\nAnd I would tell you like Geminis there might be sides to me\nShe not my main bitch, I'ma tell you she's a side to me\n\n[Outro]\nMe-e-ayee\nShe is a side to me\nShe is a side to me\nBut you are designed for me-\nYou're designed for me\nBut you are designed for me-\nYou're designed for me"}], "artist": "Denzel Curry"}
