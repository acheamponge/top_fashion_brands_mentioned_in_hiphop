Escher stairs\nOkay, you're almost halfway there!\n\n[Chorus]\nCan't stop, won't stop dancin' deep into the night\nIt's a mansion party, I bought a yacht just for tonight\nAnd if you're feeling naughty we'll smoke champagne by candlelight\nIt's a mansion party, now let's watch two pandas fight\n\n[Bridge]\nWoo-hoo-hoo\nWoo-hoo-hoo\nWoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!\nHoo-hoo!\n\n[Spoken Interlude 3]\nMy God, the battle pandas have escaped from the panda-gon and they're murdering the guests\nUh, it's last week all over again. Let\u2019s get the hell outta here!\n\n[Chorus]\nCan't stop, won't stop, nonstop runnin' for my life\nIt's a mansion party, I pray to God we all survive\nAnd if you're feeling saucy we'll grab some spears by candlelight\nIt's a mansion party, we're droppin' pandas left to right\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nSave yourself!\nArgh, this party's awesome!\nSo many pandas!\nSo glad you've come to this party, baby..."}], "artist": "Ninja Sex Party"}
