I don't wanna see you cry\nIs it your heart ooh that's breakin' all in pieces\nMakin' you cry makin' you feel blue\nIs there anything I can do\nTell me where it hurts now baby\nAnd I'll do my best to make it better\nI'll do my best to make the tears all go away just tell me where\nIt hurts now tell me\nAnd I'll love you with a love so tender\nAnd if you let me stay I'll love all the hurt away"}]}
