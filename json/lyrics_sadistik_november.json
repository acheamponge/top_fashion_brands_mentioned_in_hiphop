I felt the dear sun\nA brand new hope before the tears come\nYear two! I see In clear view\nAshamed of myself when I am near you\nYear three! I watch the stars fade\nIm a zombie whos walking through a heartache\nYear four! You're forever away and the sun now shines as my memories fade\n\n[Verse 2: Sadistik]\nAll the feelings I have are hard to word\nI can't see the problem, my vision starts to blur\nInto an image of a violent struggle\nOf a slow suicide since the time I loved you\nId, gladly die if you'd pacify\nBut you need too many things that I can't provide, so\nYou looked for it inside another's arms\nLied through ya teeth and cried that nothings wrong\n(It didn't stop) all the cryin in public\nOr telling me I'm not the only guy you were fuckin!\nBut I gave in to all my fears instead\nThe only thing that ran more than me (were the tears you shed)\nWhen you told me you cut inside ya flesh\nYou're depressed and you'd rather die instead\nI could feel my heart tear to bits\n(The first time I've cried ever since my parents split)\nAnd I knew, there was no you and I\nI kissed you goodbye, it felt like suicide\nOr a bond that was made to sever\nWhen I turned my back on you and wouldn't face the weather\nAnd for a moment, it felt like nothing mattered\nThere's givers and there's takers, and you're just the latter\nI needed help but I got a struggle\nWhen I fell to pieces you couldn't solve the puzzle\n(We wept in puddles) til we were lost at sea\n(With regretful struggles) and a faded promise ring\nYour hands were full cause you seemed to hold grudges\nWhile I chased both of our dreams through rosebushes, in November\n\n[Verse 3: Sadistik]\nI couldn't think to hold a single hope\nSo I pressed on my luck until my fingers broke\nI'm treading steps through quicksand of past love\nTo find closure from ice shoulders and hands touch\nAnd my mind is still plagued with the fragrances\nOf pain and bliss, and all the things you made me grip\nWhen Id watch ya face with teary eyes\nAnd I had to hurt myself so I could feel alive, but\nI found a place where the weather is much better now\nIn greener pastures, where the rain is never out\nAnd ya face is replaced by another\nNovember's leaves stay, but have changed for the summer\n(and my) hope meddles (where I) go settle\nIn the line that blurs from love to rose petals\nAnd the silence hurt, so I just followed through\nOn a beaten street, never reaching peaks which I saw in you\nAnd now I see that you just took me for granted\nHad a diamond in the rough and you still took me for granite\nSo i'd turn my back, on things I thought matter\nLamenting in the sins and the halos that had shattered\nIn November we gazed at sea scapes\nWith each wave, symbolizing things that we'd make\nLove and war we were born as keepsakes\nTo underscore loves accord when peace breaks, In November", "album": "The Balancing Act"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
