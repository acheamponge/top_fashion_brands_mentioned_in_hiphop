(How does it feel?)\nHow does it feel? (How does it feel?)\nHow does it feel? (Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?)\nFeels alright\nFeels alright\nFeels alright\n\n[Outro]\nPretty nice, huh?\nWe can go on for days like that", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cc84fbe9b4ede50de3970d4dc783b093.960x960x1.jpg", "album": "Complaint", "title": "Feels Alright"}]}
