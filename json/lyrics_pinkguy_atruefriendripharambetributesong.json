A 4-year-old boy slips into the zoo's gorilla habitat and over a moat wall. Suddenly, Harambe, a 17-year-old 400-pound gorilla approaches the boy. His mother watches in horror at what happens next.\n\nMommy's right here\n\n[Verse]\nOooh, Harambe (Harambe)\nWe miss you\nWe want you to come back\nOooh, Harambe (Harambe) (Harambe)\nYou were so big and strong\nAnd ever since you're gone (I can't sleep)\nLife just ain't the same without you\nWithout you (without you)\nWhen I woke up on the 28th of May\nI looked at the TV with tears running down my cheeks\nOooh, I miss you, Harambe\nI wish they took that mother's life instead\nUh, Harambe, Harambe (Harambe, Harambe)\nI miss you (Harambe)\nHarambe, why did you go?\nHarambe, Harambe (Harambe)\nI want you to come back\nIs that so much to ask?\nHarambe (Harambe)", "year": "2016-07-30"}]}
