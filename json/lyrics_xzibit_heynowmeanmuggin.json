C'mon! Oh! Ah! C'mon!\n\n[Verse 1: Xzibit]\nI'm a - menace to society baby\nThe police wanna relocate me\nThey running with gun up but they can't fade me\nThey wanted to come up but they ain't crazy\nI ride one in the chamber, with gun on cock\n'6-tre Chevrolet rollin without no top\nGot them hydraulics that's dumping, making it drop\nCalifornia to Virginia Timmy making it hot (WOOO!!!)\nTaking long rides in the G4 plane\nX Man to the stage, got 'em going insane\nYeah! Got the world saying my name\nI'm 'bout to make a little change, I'mma keep it the same, ya dig\nX to the Z baby, run up on you hitting corners\nPhantom platinum grill, c'mon\nX be the life of the party\nDon't be scared girl, reach out and touch somebody\n\n[Hook: Keri Hilson]\nCan you feel the speakers jumping? (yeah!)\nOther guys surrounding but they don't say nothing (yeah!)\nMuggin in the club like they wanna do something (yeah!)\nFeeling kinda rowdy huh? hey now! hey now!

(slow down!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHey girl! Look where I live\n40 acres and a Maybach Benz\nYou wanted to party but I got biz\nThis ain't entertainment, I'm feeding my kid\nOn a 4 or 5 in the carpool lane\nGot to hit some corners, I'm riding the caine\nWanna ride out to a island and tan your frame\nAnd just waste away a couple of days, holla back at me!\nLook where I bat\nMake the crowd get loud like the sound of a gat\nL.A. on my baseball hat\nWhere they running right up on you in that black on black\nSo move - better - bounce like a mother\nWhen brother got Mass Weapons of war with each other\nX gettin big, not ready to die yet\nMy militant mindset got you running for cover, so yo!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm the life of the party\nI got a moon roof! We poppin up out of\nLook at the whole world! They talking about us\nI got a mean hook! To rattle yo body\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wanna, talk a little, pick ya brain\nWanna see you in something little, walk around the plane\nYeah! I got a lot to gain\nGetting my label off the ground like David Blaine\nSo now, what you know bout me?!\nI'm a self made man from poverty\nYeah! Now I own a lot of property\nI \"pimp rides,\" lifestyles, and companies, so yo!\nNow let me spit you the facts\nI used to hustle the corner, but I ain't bringing you that\nNaw! I'm like swinging a bat\nRun at yo kneecaps for comin out ya face like that\nBaby girl touching my chain (oh!)\nNow let me tell you who I ain't (oh!)\nYou can't run no games\n(I'm gangster, baby ain't nothing changed)\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Xzibit"}
