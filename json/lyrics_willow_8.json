Who are you?\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou walk the streets aimlessly\nThe density is rain\nThe thoughts you think just cause you pain\nAnd don't make you more free\nWhat to do? Woe is you\nWhat to do? Who are you?\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou criticize behind those eyes\nNo hatred, you're just jealous\nYour subconscious is not conscious\nTo poison your ingestin'\nWoe is you Who are you?\nIt's your choice, just make the move\n\n[Hook]\nBurning bridges, burning bridges\nPosies all fall down\nNow consciousness is all there is\nAnd nothingness as well\nWhat are we? What to see?\nMy third eye is opening\nI'm burning bridges, burning bridges\nPosies all fall down\nAre consciousness is all that is\nBut nothingness is well\n\n[Verse 4]\nWhat are we and who are you?\nDid we just go down the drain?\nAnd I just go with my flow\nCause rollin' circles, rollin' circles, rollin' circles\nThe pavement seems too cold\nAnd now my feet turn purple\n(Hey, Willow? What?)\n\n[Verse 5]\nTake the money, take the fame\nAll I want is truth\nYou talk their language, play their games\nDid you forget 'bout who you were?\nIn the stars\nLets go back home\nThis Earth is hard\nThis Earth is all up in the stars\nThe Ursa's hungry\nHe's just lookin' for a brotha to get started\n\n[Outro]\nBurning bridges, burning bridges\nWe just fallin' down\nOur consciousness is nothingness\nAnd nothingness is well\nWho are you?\nWho am I? Who am I?\nWhere is me? Where is I?\nThere's no \"I\"\nIt's just all\n\nIt's just all, it's just all, it's just all.....\nYou don't have to walk another road or walk the road alone\n\n[Spoken Outro]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bd044d44111a084191b65a891e6eb0cc.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "3 - EP", "title": "8"}]}
