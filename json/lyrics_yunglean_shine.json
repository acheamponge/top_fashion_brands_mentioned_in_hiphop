I'm alive\nAll my brothers gon' rise\nThe feelings left in the night, in the night, in the night, oh, oh\nOutshine, all I do is outshine\nYou know I can't go outside\nI do this for my life, my life, my life\nI see fluorescent lights\nI need a bitch by my side\nAll my brothers gon' rise\nBlood on the moonlight\nLet me in, I'm alive\nLet me in, I'm alive\nLet me in, I'm alive\nYou know I can't go outside, outside, outside\nI'll promise I'll try\nI need a bitch by my side\nKnow what I do is shine\nI do this for my life, my life, my life, my life", "title": "Shine"}]}
