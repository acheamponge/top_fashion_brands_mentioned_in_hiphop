I'm the blood that pumps in your ventricles\nTechnique, I'm like your soul, nigga, indispensable\nWith no respect for those who cower at the hour of revolution\n'Cause the government owes my people restitution\nInstead of sedatives like cocaine and prostitution\nConclusion is that you'll have to violently silence me\n'Cause I raid the airwaves of cutthroat piracy\nIn school my teachers blinded me, but now I can see\nNow I'm mentally and revolutionarily free\nBroadenin' horizons about what my people could be\nIf we wasn't set up to get shot, locked, or OD\nYou see families bleed because of corporate greed\nAnd monopolizin' weed is virtually impossible\nSo it won't be legalized, and that's another obstacle\nBut I'm still rollin' up pocket fulls of tropical\nThe government's involved directly, so it's unstoppable\nLike a nuclear rocket full of biochemical toxins\nThat invade the ecological\nImprobable that the average intellect could understand\nSo I encrypted this into hip hop that's in high demand\nAnd spread it through the ghetto of every city like contraband\nStomp a man of any complexion with a devilish nature\n'Cause I'm tryin' to save the Earth\nBut you're just gettin' in line to rape her", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9c9631e16897ed9bc090afd0a05da5ae.1000x974x1.jpg", "album": "Revolutionary Vol. 1", "year": "2001-09-18"}]}
