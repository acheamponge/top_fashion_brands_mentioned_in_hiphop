(wait, wait, wait, wait, wait\n- You said that shit in '88)\nOh, I originate and create the great to dictate\nAnd regulate chumps and set em straight\nI get my point across because the boss is truly yours\nThe source to the force, so put it on pause\nThe one that assures applause, never took a loss\nStronger than some Olde E quarts to a can of Coors\nIn other words it's hazardous to your health\nSo don't do it to yourself\n\n[Hook:]\nDon't do it to yourself, don't do it\nYo, you better not do it, you better not\n\n(x2)\n\n(Stop right there, you better freeze, cease\nDon't make me put my Timberland boot to your grill piece\nBig Scoob from Brooklyn comin through, don't start me\nDon't make me turn your jam into a tec-9 party)\nHey yo, what in the world would ever possess you\nTo think that you could touch me\nOr even try to come above me\nOr even think that you could flow this lovely?\nNobody, and I mean nobody on this whole planet can stand it\nI rip it apart, and flip up the art cause I'm the best, damn it\nI crush rappers for the hell of it, defeat, I never tell of it\nSo anything else you heard is irrelevant\n(You're not on the level) man, you're not even close to me\n(Step to the Kane) and get bagged just like grocery\nSo spare yourself the misfortune and proceed with caution\nCause I don't just burn rappers, I torch em\nWith a skilled-out style that's mad diesel\nAnd I got hemorrhoids from shittin on so many people\nI crush those who oppose with blows to your nose\nWhen it comes to my crew (that's the way love goes)\nThe Chocolate City for Black Cesar Incorporated\n(And all of the soft get faded)\nSo before you step to me use your head\nAnd you better think about it more than Special Ed\nCause trust me, kid, it ain't like goin against anyone else\nI'm tellin you, don't do it to yourself\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c57181cdaaeb4f7bcf3a5a0f89a83315.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "1994-09-13", "title": "Don\u2019t Do it to Yourself", "album": "Daddy\u2019s Home"}]}
