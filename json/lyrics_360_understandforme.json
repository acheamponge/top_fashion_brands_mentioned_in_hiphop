road\nProgression slow, but I\u2019d rather that than never know\nA lot of small things I feel I need to question though\nAnd I know I\u2019ll be better if I let \u2018em go\nI think back on which lesson to quote\nBut I can\u2019t, can\u2019t seem to remember the notes\nAnd every second I hope to see a memory float\nI\u2019m in a bottomless pit so please send me a rope\nI hate fakin\u2019, the pain\u2019s taking control\nTry to tell the difference between my brain and my soul\nTo confront the emotions I feel\nI hope and appeal to understand devotion is real to myself\nAny odd pain, I turn and run\nEvery day I\u2019m hopin' and prayin\u2019 that my purpose comes\nWill I make it in this earth as one?\nPlease be up front, \u2018cause false hopes are worse than none, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Jeremedy]\nI\u2019ve got that ex-psyche ward type mind\nScribe rhymes on the type writes, tryna find a kind of finite\nAnswer, which is kinda like a phantom\nIts presence can be felt but it can\u2019t be physically fathomed\nShit, I've been to the maddest spaces in my imagination's atlas\nTravelin' places for affirmation, a axis\nBut all I ever really found was understanding\nUnderstanding that I could never quite understand it\nI mean all of this, all of this in front of us\nHow could we ever try to comprehend the point of it?\nEven if we figured it out, wouldn\u2019t it be kinda spoilin\u2019 it?\nThen in the end we would really be missin\u2019 the point of it\nSo I\u2019m just avoidin\u2019 it, you know, all these questions\nI\u2019ve been there, I\u2019ve asked that, too much time invested in it\nGuess my questions are in the form of raps and a beat\nNot to figure it out for you, but to understand it for me\n\n[Chorus: 360]\nI don\u2019t know why we walk this Earth\nBut I\u2019m tryna understand for me\nI don\u2019t know why we walk this Earth\nBut I\u2019m tryna understand\nI don\u2019t know why we walk this Earth\nBut I\u2019m tryna understand for me\nI don\u2019t know why we walk this Earth\nBut I\u2019m tryna understand\n\n[Verse 3: Jeremedy]\nTake it back to the days when I wasn\u2019t quite all there\nLet you know where I got the ex-psyche ward stare\nA time where my various personalities were all there\nAnd they were all scared, yeah, a mind for the warfare\nFound myself in a white room wearin\u2019 all white robes\nNever woulda been on this road if I'd have known\nSpending all night alone, heavy crying and chokin'\nSeemed like fire but [?] that I was smilin\u2019 and copin'\nBut my soul was shut like, like Charlton Heston's heart\nNow my head\u2019s lookin\u2019 like a big fuckin\u2019 question mark\n[?] so many times, I forget, where\u2019s the start?\nYour remedies pass full of the most dreadfulest scars\nBut it took an experience like that (Yeah) to understand\nThe fact that I\u2019m alive is what I\u2019ve come to thank\nSo if you need to question the truth, keep doing what you do (Yeah)\nNot to figure it out for me, but to understand it for you\n\n[Verse 4: 360]\nYo, I live in the present, feet embedded and I\u2019m standin\u2019 my ground\nIt might never be evident but, man, dammit, I\u2019m proud\nTo stand in the clouds and show the world exactly what I\u2019ve grown to be\nFlaunt the inside of feelings that are known to me\nI hope to see my mission's finished and refined\nTo the perfect expectations livin\u2019 in this life\nInnocence combined with an easily changed belief\nKeep it the same and don\u2019t just leave it as tainted dreams\nThere\u2019s endless time for you to send a cry for help\nBut try and recognise and identify yourself\nWith substance, meaning and a purpose to grow\nWhen you\u2019re truly content, well then the curtains will close\nAnd then it\u2019s over, completed it\u2019ll help you to fight\nI can\u2019t tell you the price for my value for life\nI held on and strived to be a man, happy and attached with pride\nUnearthin\u2019 in the deepest me, then I\u2019m satisfied\nHuh, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus: 360]\n(Understand the way)\nI try and understand how it all works\nI try and understand how it all works (Understand the way) Uh, uh\nI try and understand how it all works\nI try and understand how it all works (Understand the way) But we'll never know\nI try and understand how it all works\nI try and understand how it all works (Understand the way) So let it go\n\n[Chorus: 360]\nI don\u2019t know why we walk this Earth\nBut I\u2019m tryna understand for me (Understand the way)\nI don\u2019t know why we walk this Earth\nBut I\u2019m tryna understand (Understand the way)\nI don\u2019t know why we walk this Earth\nBut I\u2019m tryna understand for me (Understand the way)\nI don\u2019t know why we walk this Earth\nBut I\u2019m tryna understand (Understand the way)"}]}
