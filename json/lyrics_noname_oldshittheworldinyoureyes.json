Where you been?\nSeven deadly dwarfs called sin\nThe fairies don't tell themselves, a re-blessing\nAnd pressing upon the good word\nWhat it were, what it may\nWhat is read, what it say\nAll that is holy is not\nThe only thing holy is your heart when it\nThe only thing holy is your soul when it stops\nThe only thing holy is my heart when it drops"}], "artist": "Noname"}
