Yeah, '95 sound live!\nFrom doin' crimes, no more runnin' from one-time\nAlthough I know I role I gets for my title\nWhen I was young, that nickel-plated Four-Fifth was my idol\nChrome, stones, bones, and portable phones\nGetting' big hoes while I'm sittin' at home\nIs what I scheme of, so NOW what I dream of\nIs a life full of trouble, in fact\nCountin' double digit stacks\nLay back for a minute, 400 SEL, yeah, I could see myself in it!\nMurder for money, you ever heard of a dummy\nWith Glocks between his tummy, low down dirty and crummy\nTalkin' bout that Thug Life be the only life I know\nTalkin' bout that drug life without this rap shit\nProbably be the only route I go\nAnd matter of fact I know I'll strive through this fo sho\n\n[Scratching]\n\n[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]\nCould somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself\nSee ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin wealthy\nPictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin\nSeein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy\nAnd screamin I guess them nightmares as a child\nHad me scared, but left me prepared for a while\nIs there another route? For a crooked Outlaw\nVeteran, a villian, a young thug, who one day shall fall\n\n[Verse 3: EDI]\nEverday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less\nI'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin\nScheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving\nCause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up\nI'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka\nTried makin fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin\nAnd Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking\nWhen I gets to pervin, so what?\nGo put some work in, and make my mail, makin sales\nRisking 25 with a 'L', but oh well\n\n[Scratching]", "title": "Thug Seed"}]}
