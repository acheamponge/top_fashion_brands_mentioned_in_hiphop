I'ma evolve continue to change\nIt take brains, balls and backbone to get it on\nAnd keep it on, we keepin it movin, to each his own\nSo I spit about it, whatever I feel about it\nI'm just bein real about it; X get hot nigga forget about it\nSpeech don't faill me now\nDedicated to the enemies and friends that hold me down\n\n(Chorus: Nate Dogg)\nWe back on line We came to ride\nWe build We stack We multiply\nWe (stay on the grind) Until we die\nAnd back for mo', cause we can't get enough\n\n(Xzibit)\nAbove the rest, accept no less\nGo ahead, check the game, be my guest\nSomethin brand new and heavy to get off my chest\nWin time after time 'til there ain't none left\nHardhat, punch the clock, back to work\nI'm bigger, stronger, faster, built to hurt\nEverybody and anybody who come to my party\nLike they ready to get roudy and touch somebody\nWho's that nigga y'all came to see? \"X!\"\nOften imitated, but cannot be, \"X!\"\nWhat's next, collect respect like paychecks\nStraight to the bank with my bitch and have safe sex\nWhat do you believe in? I believe in\nSeizin the moment, livin and dyin to spit with a vengeance\nHere for redemption - been around forever\nY'all cats were just too blind to listen\n\n(Chorus)\n(Nate Dogg)\nIt ain't my fault.. we keep droppin hits\nAnd you can't spit like this, so I'm takin yo' bitch\nIt ain't shit changed.. we gon' bang like this\nAnd I'm drinkin this fifth, we still don't take no shit\n\n(Xzibit)\nI got a \"Sixth Sense,\" that tells me you ain't worth six cents\nI'm sick with my sixth sense\nWhattup Doc? I'm gettin down to business\nCrooked ass the cops to the Rampart district\nLose yourself in the music, move it or lose it\nAbuse it, let's booze it, please don't confuse it with the\nNext man, it's the X Man rollin\nStand firm, solid as the ground I'm holdin\nMake mine Golden, permanent State issue\nStacked with the wealth that you can't take witchu\nLong range missile, if we got issues\nI'ma squeeze this shit and nobody gon' miss you\nI'ma keep swingin 'til the medics come get you\nWe busy, stay off my line, you can't get through\nPeep the design from the mastermind\nYo Dre, bring that shit back one more time!\n\n(Chorus - repeat 2X)"}], "artist": "Xzibit"}
