Yeah, I'ma just ignore you\nWalking towards you with my head down\nLookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you\nParanoia, what did I do wrong this time?\nThat's parents for you\nVery loyal? Shoulda had my back\nBut you put a knife in it\u2014my hands are full\nWhat else should I carry for you?\nI cared for you, but\u2026\n\n[Chorus]\nFeels like we're on the edge right now\nI wish that I could say I'm proud\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nLe-le-let you down\nAll these voices in my head get loud\nI wish that I could shut them out\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nLe-le-let you down\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, you don't wanna make this work\nYou just wanna make this worse\nWant me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words\nYou don't wanna know my hurt, yeah\nI forgot everything that I was supposed to be saying\nHop on the microphone and all of you people know I ain\u2019t playin\nChillin chillin yeah everybody talking to me like they really understand\nPut cape around my neck and woo\nYeah I\u2019m lookin like I\u2019m Superman\nOh super yeah\nThey really understand that\nTake the money when they make a lot of money but the money\u2019s like a problem when they get it so quick\nTake it back man\nTake it back woo\n\n[Chorus]\nFeels like we're on the edge right now\nI wish that I could say I'm proud\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nLe-le-let you down\nAll these voices in my head get loud\nI wish that I could shut them out\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nLe-le-let you down\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, don't talk down to me\nThat's not gonna work now\nPacked all my clothes and I moved out\nI don't even wanna go to your house\nEvery time I sit on that couch\nI feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we\nCoulda made this work\nAnd prolly woulda figured things out\nBut I guess I'm a letdown\nBut it's cool, I checked out\nOh, you wanna be friends now?\nOkay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now\nSit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen\nI mean, why are you laughing?\nMust have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction\nNo, but at least you're happy\n\n[Chorus]\nFeels like we're on the edge right now\nI wish that I could say I'm proud\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nOh, I let you down\nAll these voices in my head get loud\nAnd I wish that I could shut them out\nI'm sorry that I let you down\nOh, let you down\n\n[Outro]\nI'm sorry\nI'm so sorry now\nYeah, I'm sorry that I let you down"}], "artist": "NF"}
