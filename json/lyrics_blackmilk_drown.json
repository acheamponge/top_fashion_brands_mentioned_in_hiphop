(Naw)\nFeel like you grounded? (Naw)\nNope\nFeel the doubt\nCan't get a smile so image of frown\nAnd with a bow twenty niggas around\nStanding 'round all my niggas around me\nCrew all grew up in the same surrounding\nThese niggas wyling\nNext door they was dialing 9-11\nWhen its getting violent you can hear the sirens go\nSomething that now I know\nEither man you gotta go\nWhen they hit the block, when you hear the pop\nNiggas is adios\nGotta be out your mind truth\nSo how do you shine with all of that dark inside of you\nHoping better days will find you\n\n[Bridge]\nDon't see a change coming\nThey say they wanna change up\n\nHey ey ey\n\n[Verse 2]\nIts like officer, officer\nWhat have you done\nHow many apples can spoil a bunch\nYou just need one\nSo if you can't stand up\nWhen fellow officers shoot a kid with they hands up\nI don't know who we can trust\nMiddle fingers both hands\nJammed in handcuffs\nSeems like a war on us all its a manhunt\n(?) no land of the free\nCan't even go stand on the street\nWithout getting runned up on\nWith red and blue lights with two white cops\nAlready ready to pull triggers on sight\nOr on who might just so happen to have black skin\nThey act now the same as they did back then\nBack when\nAll for one, one for all\nHad to show them all\nFuck you, fuck your law, and fuck your protocol\nThis never ending war we've all seen this scene before\nTry to change and get the same results\n\nWhites\n\n[Outro]\nYeah\nWhy they talking my flow?\nWhy they robbing our glow?\nOut here robbing our soul\nOut here outta control\n(?) been crying no more\n(?)"}], "artist": "Black Milk"}
