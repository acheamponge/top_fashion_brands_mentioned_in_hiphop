I'm at the end of my rope, cause\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Pusha T]\nUh, Lord knows I done seen the worlds cold shoulder\nSeein my future through the crystal-ball of bakin' soda\nOasis of hoes, my champagne supernova\nThe high life and high times, I watched 'em turn sober\nSeen it all come crashin', crashin'\nThe Feds was at the door, and no they not askin'\nSayin' they found drugs, but they ain't talkin' aspirin\nDiesel design ones and I ain't talkin' fashion\n\n[Verse 4: Malice]\nMoney hoes and clothes is Malice's past tense (The past is past!)\nAll said forgiven, all you do is askin'\nEven when laughin' I can't explain the hurt\nKnowin' I can't change the world in a verse (I wish I could!)\nEven to myself, I'm feelin' my screw's loose\nBut how can I deny what I know to be true? (I gotta live with myself!)\nWhen I didn't have a clue, shoulda viewed it as a gift\nNow I see what they mean - ignorance is bliss (I see what they mean)\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Clipse"}
