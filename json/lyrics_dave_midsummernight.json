He's moving shifty\nHe turns to Rappy, we laugh a bit, we're laughing at how hard he is and live is what this party is\nThis musics so loud and Bish says there's no loud and Rappy say's i've got that\nBut my man in the back he says, i've got AM and i've got cheese\nFrom now understand I am the streets\nAnd i'll tax the streets whatever I say\nAnd look in my pouch, he started looking around\nI took a look in the pouch, and saw a Smith and Wesson\nI started looking around, and i saw less and less of\nMy niggas around, I just see figures around, some foreign niggas around\nSo dead sitting around\nRappy can we cut, this niggas one-nil up\nHe says hurry up and then he points at me\nI'm like see fuck this, can we cut quick\nWe've been outnumbered plus we ain't armed so\nWe left the party in a hurry\nRJs like fuck this and he's going mental\nAnd Rappys like fuck this can we find a metal\nAnd i ain't even talking much\nYou see that nigga on the right\nOf the nigga moving sleight\nIs the nigga I don't like\nBut imma fix it soon\nThere was a nigga with a knife\nAnd a nigga with a nine\nAnd all these niggas moving white\nWe got to fix it soon\nThey put a gun up to my friends\nTalking bout taxing the ends\nI know we lost the skengs\nBut imma fix it soon\nDialed MC, blud i need a favour\nHe's talking reckless on the phone\nI told him save that shit for later\nRun up in the party\nWhere's the paper?\nRun up in the party\nSlapped a Barbie tryna stop me, see you later\nRun up in the party\nFuck the neighbours\nRun up in the party\nIn the toilets niggas tryna catch some brain\nRan up in the toilets with no heat on me\nThis niggas pulling for his pouch like he's gon beat on me\nUntil M came around and took the strap away\nAnd Jussy sweeped that fuckboy to his feet for me\nI blacked out for a minute\nA flurry of punches they come in abundance\nThese tires are pumped and this nigga's winded\nI turned the smithy around\nAnd now I'm sitting him down\nGave him a kick in the mouth\nAnd now this nigga's injured\nM took that gun and I closed my eyes\n'Cause M he came for an end\nAnd we don't need life\nThis is all in a second so as eyes light up\nTime slows down I feel my hands tie up\nFight of fright triggers\n'Cause I'm shook of what he could do\nHe could either jook you or cook you\nTime's still frozen and every nigga's stood still\nM's tryna bang I see the saftey clip drop\nIt's safe to say my lip dropped\nI'm tryna scream M no\nBut the words won't go\nIf he bangs we all go\nI know this nigga's loco\nBut this nigga must know this is a murder case we don't need\nOver a skeng and some weed\nSo I tried to grab him but he bursts first\nI speared him to the floor but it was too late\nThe mood changed\nI heard screams in the back like fiends on the crack\nI heard screams in the back\nI'm looking at this nigga thinking can I save him\nHe's lying in the bath I know he's a paigon\nBut 25 to life that is the longest statement\nI'm checking for the wound I don't see lacerations\nI don't see blood don't see none M sees up\nHe said it backfired say God knows\nAnd then we drag him to the floor\nLike you're not banging anymore\nThat was a sign from the Lord\nWe heard police sirens\nWe started ducking\nEvery nigga's cutting\nDon't get nicked\nWe kept on running\nEvery nigga's hopping fences bruv\nWe kept on sprinting\nThe dogs are chasing I hear the barking\nThe dogs are breathing on my calf and if they bite I'm tarnished\nIt's every man for himself when it's dogs or feds\nAnd it was both and now my niggas on the ropes\nAnd every nigga better hope that we get away\nWe had our arms on our arms using arms for our getaway\nRapz is struggling to get away\nHe's bleeding from his leg he was limping he was setting pace\nThe mandem they hold the flat door open\nSaying get in then hold the dogs out then cut after we close it\nRappy's fallen to the floor frozen\nI pick my nigga up by the arms\nHe may get in and now we're rolling\nThe dogs are at the door barking waiting for the jakes\nBy the time we come we turn to dust\nWe turning up\nGot Rappy to the clinic he'll be fine\nWe got M's here a new phone we just lost another line\nGuns drugs women paigons and the knives\nAll in the veil of a mid summer's night", "year": "2015-07-02"}], "artist": "Dave"}
