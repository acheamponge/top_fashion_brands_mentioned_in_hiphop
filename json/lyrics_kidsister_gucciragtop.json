Gucci rag top!\nGucci rag top, bad socks...\nOn the damn zodiac\nSwinging in my ear\nTripping...\nPocket full of cash, popping, popping tears\nYes, guess... Burn calorie\nDamn, what's the name...\nLooking, looking at your girl\nLike I ain't never seen them!\nNo you haven't, I'm the baddest\nAnd no bitch you can't have this!\n... I'll put a rabbit on my hat like I was magic\nI'll... while I hollow at your man!\nCall yourself a cab, cause I'm calling outta...\nHe can't help it...\n... in my Gucci rag top!\nWith the Gucci, Gucci rag top!\nWith their Gucci, Gucci rag top!\nGucci rag top, Gucci rag top!\nGucci, let's go!\nIs Gucci mind the money...\nGucci got interior, haters are inferior\nAnd I say it two times\nCause... Gucci two times\nGucci, Gucci...\nIt ain't nobody...\nAin't nobody... women\nAin't nobody...\nGucci!"}]}
