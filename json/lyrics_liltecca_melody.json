I\u2005cannot\u2005give you company\nShe\u2005tell me that she like my\u2005melody, the reason why she wanna fuck with me\nBaby girl what you on? Shorty gon' hit me and ask what I got\nI hit her right back, said I got a lot\nStand on ten toes, no I cannot flop\nI feel like Blueface, 'cause I got the mop\nHe try to run, now you get wet like a mop\nAnd I came from the bottom, your bitch give me top\nAll you niggas is jokes, no, you feel like Chris Rock\nI'm rockin' the Angels Palm on my arm, not with the bickerin' or the drama\nOnly the family, can't stop us-"}], "artist": "Lil Tecca"}
