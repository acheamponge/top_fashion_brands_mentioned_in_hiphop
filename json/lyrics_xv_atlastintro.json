I like to introduce myself for those that don't know me. I go by the name of XV. And Complex ain't on the way no more. It's finally here. Yeah, yeah\nThis here is what we call The Complex Experiment. In the makings of such a classic album we generated different ideas all over the place, that, kinda didn't fit the mode of what we were creating on the album. This is the beginning. I brought Seven along for the ride. Production genius by the way. He produced all the tracks you're about to vibe to. But see I hate when rappers got dope beats for they intro but don't use it. So, if you don't mind, I'm just gonna talk my shit for a second\n\n[Verse]:\nSeven can I spit eight quick bars?\nDawg you must of understood my soul\nI'm saying bring hip hop back\nYou must of understood my goal\nTake what I'm handed in the state of Kansas\nMost niggas just would not know\nHow to deal with silly Dream Killers telling you you should not flow\nNiggas saying, \"Hoffa should not blow.\"\nTake it places niggas would not go\nSpitting chilly words of engineering verses rented to me course it's cause I'm still cold\n{backwards}\nSpin it back like a b-boy show\nAfter Complex, Bling and Sez next then we all gonna tour the globe"}], "artist": "XV"}
