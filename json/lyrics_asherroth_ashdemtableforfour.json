Roth small forward\nI wanna cross-over ever since I saw Jordan, but\nNow I'm torn wanna be more Bird\n33 so mean on that green uniform, but\nReally what I means and it seems I've learned\nI can only be me, I can be no more\nWhen I'm free, I'm pure, When I speak I'm sure\nThat everything released comes deep from the core\nLike back in \u201904 way 'fore I scored a single that had lingered\nAnd got us on tour I would rap for a laugh\nRap just to passin' the time and\nThen passin' the rhyme to the left\nGot signed and forget how to rhyme and direct like\nFrom the feeling from the feelings that I get\nSo back to the back to the basics\nWhite t-shirt and some mother fucking Asics\nAy bitch this is the rebirth of the greatest\nFamous name and it starts with an A it's\u2014Ash Roth!", "year": null}]}
