A new attitude, you're tryin to act rude\nYou saw _Menace_ and now you in a gangsta mood\nWhat are you kiddin me? That's the heart of stupidity\nIf you wanna be a gangsta, join the mafia in Italy\nFakin and frontin on stage like you're hard\nI hope when you get to Detroit, the real thugs gon' pull your card\nFlashin guns like you got somethin to prove G\nWhat, you wanna be in the next John Singleton movie?\nYou're sayin that you're buckwhylin\nBut don't convince me, convince the brothers on the Island\nOtherwise just forget it, unless niggas that did ten years\nSay you a gangsta, I ain't wit it\n\"Yo, I raped his mother, yo, I shot and killed him\"\nIs that what you wanna get across to the children?\nI guess you're not gonna be happy til it's for real\nFour year old kids, doin drivebys on Big Wheels\nOr maybe you wanna see it be more fatal\nLike Kindergarten kids, tryin to cook crack with Play-Doh\nNow I don't mean to take the fun out the jam\nI just want some to understand about the gun in the hand\nWe gotta show our people how to live equal\nPeace out, I'm catchin folks on the sequel\n\n[Chorus]\nIt go, heidi heidi heidi ho\nAnd yo I got the funky flow\nSo let yourself go!\nUh-huh, heidi heidi heidi ho\nAnd yo I got the funky flow\nSo let yourself go!\nCome on, heidi heidi heidi ho\nAnd yo I got the funky flow\nSo let yourself go!\nCome on, heidi heidi heidi ho\nAnd yo I got the funky flow\nSo let yourself go!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c57181cdaaeb4f7bcf3a5a0f89a83315.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "1994-09-13", "title": "Let Yourself Go", "album": "Daddy\u2019s Home"}]}
