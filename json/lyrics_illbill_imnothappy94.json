It falls to pieces\nMy mouth releases terminal diseases\nAnd everywhere you look there's another dead fucking schnook\nHanging from a bloody meat hook\nI always keep a smile on my face\nSo I can hide what's really going on inside of my mind\nI feel nothing and therefore I am nothing\nI pry for on your suffering and there's nothing that makes you feel happy\n\n(Chorus X2)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2bac33967790d87128fa9676f5b0c7b0.600x600x1.jpg", "album": "The Early Years: Rare Demos \u201991-\u201994", "year": "2003-09-16"}]}
