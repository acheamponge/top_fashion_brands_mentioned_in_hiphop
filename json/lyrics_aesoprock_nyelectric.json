Load bazooka\nScoped the culprit hulks over a broken hookah\nGot rebel camps with siphons amped to cookie-cut the wattage\nElectric ilk NY raised on b-movie sluts and gossip\nConditioned the bodega rodent moment composure to echo numb and uncommon, dumb monkey pollen\nMy 23's lean over a cobra motor milligram bender, novelty\nI tip lids prior to clipping the comradery\nCheck the muck out\nWhen metal maggots burrow in Promised Land vein division I tug my brim down over my astigmatism, low pro\nPaxil Rose, Axl broke and butchered\nLast catapult standing in a land of coke and hookers\nKing Kong potluck, no parking for rickshaw loads of sock puppets and sitcoms\nJust Krylon pigs bred in a hot boxed wigwam\nSerotonin deficient teens demonstrate ease in the modern day Uzi purchase\nThe foundation of their alacrity makes the mothers nervous\nMe? Oh I check the newest murals to see whose still bombing this fucker and um respect\u201d\nFind out what it means to me, New York\nWalk blocks with electric ninjas who bark/bounce for trunked out whips\nLike, \"My company DeLorean's the shit\"\nSkipper's out of happy pills again\nHe's in the neighbors garbage.  (Ahh Skippy)\nHe's making paper dolls decorated with targets  (Don't do it)\nHe's labeling the dolls with the names of shitty rap artists (Nooo)\nThen tearing out the still-beating heart from the loose-leaf carcass\nI ordered a hovercraft off the back page of an Archie comic\nBuilt it in three days to float above snarky comments\nMy gills call the East River rock bottom home with three-eyed guppies and seahorse mutations\nSee, New York is ancient Rome.  Basic.  Basically stone.  Faces\nMy friend jumped off the Empire State Building while I hung with 10th grade head cases\n\"Some of them will blossom famous\", some of them will blossom baseheads\nBut they all rep rivets in the die-cast metal Voltron cadence, what?\n\n[Hook: Aesop Rock]\nN, Y, Electric, Catalog, Burners, Pigs, Magnums, Crack, Bag lady, Roach bait, Pristine kicks, Thread and the iris of the needle\nImma thread the needle\nImma thread the needle\nImma thread the needle\nImma thread the needle\nHere we go\nDah dah dah, dah dah dah\nDah dah dah, dah dah dah\nBreaker 1-9, 9-11-01 witness, maybe you don't get this\n\n[Verse II: Aesop Rock]\nKill 'em all slow\nI was on a serious tree bender with my hands up at a C-Rayz-Walz show\nNether-circuit bacon don't police me anymore\nYour trained professionals demonstrate 41 shots over par\nLeast common denominator raise truth like Charlie, Willy and Gramps raise roofs in a glass Wonkavator (Monster Maker)\nOperate wild by the company of unturned stones and litter\nTalk his way out of a sunburn and be home in time for dinner\nPaid dues since before the days of bad acid and Quaaludes\nWhile the boombox talks trash to the Richter\nStalking awkward with a zip lock on the pill hole\nBitter fucker, nothing is free\nI'll spend my last dollar on me\nPut one up for my family, should've made time to thank 'em\nPut one up for my crew, for recognizing the sanctum\nPut one up for the socially broke, choked and smoky New York piss hiss bleed Dolby, homey\n\n[Hook: Aesop Rock]\n\n[Outro: Vast Aire]\nWelcome to NY Electra\nWhere buildings fall and hopes crash, niggas\nYeah, I\u2019m Vast Aire from Can Ox\nPeace to Atoms Fam, Juggaknots, Stronghold, Blockhead, MF Doom, Cage, head boppers tune in\nAll my niggas holdin it down in NY, that's my mother fuckin word\n\n\n[Hunter Interlude]\n\n\"You\u2019ve been all over the world\nYou\u2019ve hunted just about every kind of game\nYou\u2019ve stalked elephant, lions, tigers, polar bears, deer\nYou\u2019ve been within 15, 20 yards the most dangerous game in the world\nYou\u2019ve been everywhere\nYou\u2019ve been with some of the most famous guides and hunters in the world\nWhat\u2019s the biggest thrill you\u2019ve ever had out of all of that?\"\n\n\"Well I think I can answer that best by calling attention to the ...\"\n\nBazooka Tooth, bitch\nI'm saying bazooka \"tooth\" right?
