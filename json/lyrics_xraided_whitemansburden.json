The tension's in the air thick\nAnd hate got me so high I'm gettin' airsick\nYou got my people broke, lookin' for a buck to borrow\nDoin' it one day at a time, FUCK TOMORROW!\nFuck your song!\nI want revenge!  I got a beretta named Vendetta\nTime to answer for your sins nigga\nAnd when you meet your creator tell him I said, \"I apologize\"\nBut I gotta ride...\n\n[Chorus] - repeat til' fade"}], "artist": "X-Raided"}
