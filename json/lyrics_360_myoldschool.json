(uh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI was a fiend for the basketball, preachin' that I had a dream\nEvery month I'd buy a One on One magazine\nDreams of meetin' Michael Jordan in 3D\nThe closest I came was Come Fly With Me in Three-Peat\nAnd with the hip-hop, it happened in grade six\nMe and mates writin' down the credits from skate vids\nMethod Man to Smith and Wesson [?] the stages\nMy first hip-hop CD was 36 Chambers\nAnd Michael Jackson, my definite best age\nObsessin' to press play and wreckin' cassette tapes, like\n\"Smooth Criminal\" and \"Thriller\" and \"Bad\"\nI watched his movie, I was glad I didn't live with his dad\nAnd with any type of music you're forever learnin'\nAnd a Midnight Oil fan, yo, my head would turn for Beds Are Burnin'\nAnd when it come to Slim Shady I'm a real addict\nBig L to Nas, 'cause Illmatic is still classic\nEvery item of clothing was bought at Kmart\nBut it'd always get ripped down at the skatepark\n\n[Refrain]\nIt's my old school, hell yeah, them times were good\nIf I could spend one week back in time I would\n\n[Chorus]\nI sit imaginin', if I had a time machine\nSo I could go back in time when ya life's a dream\nThe happiest days, remember the past\nWhen you were young, remember how your energy lasts?\n\n[Outro]\nHahaha, yeah\nThat's my old school, it's 360"}]}
