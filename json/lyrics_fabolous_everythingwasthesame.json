'Cause when you good the, devil hate it\nAnd even if you heavy weighted people want you feather weighted\nAttention I never payed it, me and this clever lady\nShe brains, do some thangs, then we lay together faded\nAnd while I chill, loaded up a steel\nJust wishin' a nigga would but knowin' a nigga will\nBut for real nigga good is how you feel\nBut soon as a nigga good is as soon as a nigga will\nStill, I don't owe these niggas nothing, put that in a nigga will\n\n[Outro: Stacy Barthe]\nDamned if you do them, if you don't, don't don't don't\nYou're damned if you do them, if you don't\nBut they don't have a heaven or hell to put you through\nPeople sit around and judge you anyway\nDon't, don't don't", "title": "Everything Was The Same"}]}
