Nah, the future's black\nI said, shoot at me and I'll shoot you back\nThe future's bleak? Nah, the future's black\nI'm Black Opsing it, (brap) pop the clip into my pistol\nNow watch this shit (2x)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm a Vietnam vet, the damn best\nMessing with your head as if I'm Russian Roulette\nAnd yet, I'm a respectable professional and best of all\nI'm the closest that you'll ever get, to being Charlton Heston, fool\nI was the best in school, exceptional\nBut then I left it all to get some tools\nAnd head back to the future\nStealth action shooter\nC.I.A man, Marine Captain Trooper\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nTo battle Alex Mason, That'd take some adaptation\nI'm the line between rivalry and annexation\nNow I'm handing the plate on to David\nFor another generation of bullet penetration\nAs enemies are taken out without hesitation\nFor stealth infiltration or sheer devastation\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2012-12-05"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
