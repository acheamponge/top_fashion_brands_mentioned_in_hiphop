Melted cheese, egg on Jewish challah bread\nSixth grade, getting paid into duels proper\nHustled five crackers at my middle school locker\nPiggybank grow fat like Diddy bankroll\n[?] and jaws that can\u2019t blow\nSelf done changed.  Fascinated by the game, I bugged out\nThey raised twenty-five cent prices for my video games\nMortal Kombat.  Time for no contract\nBack to the Future\u2014no one told McFly, but where my moms at?\n[?], face shining\nDrug-addicted, no label would sign me\nWe grew up three sons.  I was the youngest\nMost talented, dumbest, stuffed my face\nWith garlic peanut hummus.  The hardest lesson learned\nWhile my varsity sports team that never succeeded\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz and (Kosha Dillz)]\nMy rhymes ain\u2019t good?  My rhymes misunderstood?\n(Pardon me again, dog), \u2018cause that\u2019s my childhood\n(We grew up playing, running bases)\nTen years later, I was on the streets, running with baseheads\nMy rhymes ain\u2019t good?  My rhymes misunderstood?\n(Pardon me again, dog), \u2018cause that\u2019s my childhood\n(Always kept my mouth shut), thought I was about bucks\n(My pops put the house up).  He said:\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nScruff-faced for life, enveloped cheap talk out the side of his mouth\nDue to the [science, god pressed it?] but had the appetite for extra cheese\nNo justice.  Just iced and freezing\nSolidifying steeze at thirty-two degrees\nPast twenty-five and black?  You a funny guy\nAnd rap will get you clapped like crack money stacks\nHigh in the lab.  How can you relate to, uh, soon as this drop, yo\nI will stop eating tuna fish and tacos, waffles and falafels\nIs there more in store in the floors and storage?\nSerial numbers all scratched off the porridge\nSuper-Bowl-smashed your helmet after good hits\nI\u2019m a ghetto lighter.  If I\u2019m losing you, I\u2019ll show you hood flicks\nI could be raking the dough, but I\u2019m leaving where it falls\nMy concentration\u2019s on flow and that\u2019s war, that\u2019s raw\nBlack pain stain my face, drape like tatted tears.  I\nRough the beat up in revenge of my battle here to see justice\n\n[Hook (Overlapped with Matisyahu Adlibs): C-Rayz Walz and (Kosha Dillz)]\nMy rhymes ain\u2019t good?

He said:\n\n[Verse 3: Matisyahu]\nUsed to be me in my room with no DJ, eh\nJust a PA and a pair of JBL speakers\nIn the attic of my parents\u2019 house.  Not a mouse was heard\n1 PM in the afternoon, trying to\nSuck some resin from the pipe before pops gets home\nPut my lips to the mic when the king got\nHis power from a ground amplifier, no\nEarplugs and I\u2019d beatbox in the shower for song\nWe reverberation, just trying to make it back from a long vacation\nStill trying to find my way home, but, all along, I knew\nI was never alone.  No, you\u2019re never alone\nSmoking all that weed\u2019ll make a man-a jump sound, stereo\nWe used to mix our Frosted Flakes with Cheerios\nLSD, Ecstasy, slice through reality\nOnly seventeen, trying to find my queen\nI never developed a center, so my heart\u2019s empty\nSleeping in the rain just to feel something\nYoung bucks never think that they\u2019ll damage their brain\nI was roaming through your world, looking for some milk and honey\nAnd still am.  Some think that life is just funny and some\nJust stare at the Sun \u2018til they can\u2019t see me\nI\u2019ll stick to my guns and do what we\u2019ve always done\nWhether burned in the oven or lost at sea completely\n\n[Hook (Overlapped with Matisyahu Adlibs): C-Rayz Walz and (Kosha Dillz)]\nMy rhymes ain\u2019t good?
