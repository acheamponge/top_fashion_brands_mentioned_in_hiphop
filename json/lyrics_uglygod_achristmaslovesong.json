Last till when?\nTill Christmas of course, whenever I sing about Santa Claus and Christmas, I get so, so impatient!\nSanta Claus, wherever you are, I hope you're getting ready!\n\n[Verse]\nI\u2019m losing hair and I'm scared and its too embarrassing\nI move aware with the care of a true samaritan\nArrogant, staring with eyes glaring in merriment\nChristmas time blaring the carols there in the air again\nMaybe its me and I just need someone to listen\nWe can talk about my dog you never seen and how you missed it\nWhile i stare at you amazed from all your flaws to every blemish\n\u2018Cause this time here is for you, I hope you have a Merry Christmas\n\nI'd like to sit on Skype with you and find the things you're into\nSo if I spent my Christmas there, I'd find something to give you\nOr maybe bring a mistletoe in high hopes that I kiss you\nAnd if I'm not you're type, I'd slice my heart right to the tissue\nOr maybe put it to the side and be the guy you vent to\nAnd if your god was really real I\u2019d like to think he sent you\nOr he\u2019d pull me to the side to say I'm not the guy you\u2019re into\nCause if he really answered prayers, I'd be right there with you\nComfortable", "title": "A Christmas Love Song", "year": null, "album": null}], "artist": "Ugly God"}
