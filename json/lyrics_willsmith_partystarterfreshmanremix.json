Uh uh, when you're the party starter\nIt's like you're on call, you're what the doctor ordered\nIt's like you gotta block the border to the door\n& shock 'em when it's boring...\nGIT ON THE FLOOR!!\nUghh, it's the groovicide bomber, mic in my vest\nTight, strapped to my chest\nLike, I'ma run up in the party hollerin'\n& be like \"Ohhh!\", fulfillin' my callin'\nBig! (Big), Will! (Will), that's my name! (whoop)\nWritin' rhymes, that's my game! (whoop)\nAsk me again and I'll tell you the same! (whoop)\nJust write ya number down right next to ya name, girl\n\n[Chorus x 2]\nI'ma make you dance all night (I'm the party starter)\nYou gonna break a sweat (I'm the party starter)\nI don't care what you heard\nI don't care where you been\nA party ain't a party till I get there\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe was raised in the days when the roof was raised\nEvery rap occasion, new & amazing\nThe back of the stage amazed and gazin'\nPrayin for the day they would one day praise him\nStudied the ways of the game & made it\nCame through the maze & the haze & played it perfect\nDays any person hated & cursed him, he was unfazed\nHe waited, it was worth it, he never retaliated\nHe saved it, slavin', on the road blazin'\nDays when he was low, nothin' could raise him\nHe came to the show & somethin' uncaged in him\nLike the pope, but its party crusade\nI'm like braids that's never gon'\nFade (ya heard)\nI'm like, 23's on an Escalade, throw me into the rave\nLike you threw a grenade - BOOM!!\n\n[Chorus x2]\nI'ma make you dance all night (I'm the party starter)\nYou gonna break a sweat (I'm the party starter)\nI don't care what you heard\nI don't care where you been\nA party ain't a party till I get there\n\n[Verse 3]\nI call for the days of the unadulterated\nWhen the artistry was cultivated\nYou know, back when rap was smart and multilayered\nWe could rap without A&Rs& ultimatums (damn)\nNow today I could say I long for the days when the party was all about partyin'\nI was a mini-party starter then\nMy mind bends when I call my pen\nThe big question should I run the mind a vittle\nFood for thought or dumb the rhyme a little\nBut Will \"if you come to high that'll alienate folks & they won't buy it\"(yo)\nLook, people getting trapped in the track\n& they be clappin', even when the rappin' is wack\nYo, what happened, when did we get happy wit that?\nHe's old-fashioned (yup), but let's be happy he's back\n(Ya heard me!)\n\n[Chorus x 2]\nI'ma make you dance all night (I'm the party starter)\nYou gonna break a sweat (I'm the party starter)\nI don't care what you heard\nI don't care where you been\nA party ain't a party till I get there", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8624e4a6fdfb9b83008647b72d71bbee.371x371x1.jpg", "album": null, "title": "Party Starter (Freshman Remix)"}]}
