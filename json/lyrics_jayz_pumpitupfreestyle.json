Dot, the Collection\nBlack Album coming soon\nJust gon' vent a little bit\nHave a little fun with it\nYes, yes\n\n[Verse]\nAin't nobody dumpin' on Hov, you ain\u2019t in sanitation\nOr sanitarium, what are you, crazy? Jay-Z'll bury 'em\nI'll get you drug out the club, they'll have to carry 'em\nGo ahead, bug out, I'll Raid, nigga, scurry\nWorry, I'm, not, the Mike Jordan of the mic recording\nIt's Hovi, baby, you Kobe, maybe; Tracy McGrady\nMatter-fact, you a Harold Miner\nJ.R. Rider, washed up on marijuana\nEven worse, you a Pervis Ellis\nYou worthless, fella; you ain't no athlete, you Shawn Bradley\nI ain\u2019t talkin' to nobody in particular\nMy flow's just vehicular homicide when I\u2019m kickin' up DUST!\nAnybody in my path is a car crash waiting to happen\nNigga, WHAT!\nI got my foot on the throat on the pulse of this rap game\nAnd I ain\u2019t letting up, YUP!\nWho\u2019s the nicest? Life or lifeless on these mic devices\nAnd I don't write this, I just mic this, I will it to happen\nOne-take Hov, I\u2019m real at this rapping\nMy new name is Just the Facts\nWhile the rest of y'all just adjust the facts\nPut words together, just to match\nI say what I feel, y\u2019all adjust to that\nI do the opposite of y\u2019all so I just attract\nThe realer audience usually unjustly Black\nKnow my flow and the shit they go through just match\nLike the sound of my voice and a choice Just track\nI just tackle the subject, the flak from the public is nothing\nI know real niggas happen to love it\nIf you don\u2019t like it, then look in the mirror\nMost likely you ain\u2019t live it so you don\u2019t get it\nYou ain\u2019t did it, so you can't vision, the picture I\u2019m painting\nAin't vivid, the language I\u2019m spitting is so foreign to ya\nSee what starving'll do to ya\nGrowin' up hard in a little apartment'll do to ya\n\n[Outro]\nHah, I\u2019m just talkin\u2019 to ya\nI'm just talkin' through ya", "title": "Pump It Up Freestyle", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0572d3c2a8305ab228c6cfdc3005ee89.300x300x1.jpg", "year": null, "album": "The S.
