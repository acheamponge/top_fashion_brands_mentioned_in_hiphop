I just thank God that I'm gifted\nMade it to the top and I stood up, first I had to crawl in them trenches\nWe got hate in us, tryna murder somethin', runnin' through the field, hoppin' fences\nThey left blood stains on our corner, gotta spin back with a vengeance\nGlock discharge, it's a man down, real gang members handle business\n\n[Chorus]\nBlood, sweat, and tears what I shed, sleepless nights in my bed\nThey only love when you shining, I won't let it get to my head\nGot a lil' one on the way, now I gotta do this shit for my kid\nHavin' conversations with the sky and I meant everything that I said\nFor my family, gotta build a legacy, I'ma be the man when I'm dead\nWorked too hard, I can't slip up, so I'm clutching tight on this lead\nNaw, I ain't a killer, but don't push me, I'm too close to the edge\nIs what it is, ain't no looking back, don't regret the things that I did\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe some young niggas, we don't give a fuck, knock a nigga head right off\nBunch of hollow shells on that crime scene, it was DOA, white chalk\nI know real killers, no remorse in 'em, proud of the bodies they caught\nWent through a lot and I'm only 20, it's a lot of things that I saw\nShit left me cold on the inside, feelin' like I need to unthaw\nWas it to fill a void or acceptance? Lookin' at the things that I bought\nI still get depressed in my mansion, contemplating, deep in my thoughts\nI'm just glad that I'm still standing, it's a lot of demons I fought\nVoices in my head and that gun cocked, late night rides in all black\nReally come from nothin', I was on that block like the streets all that I got\nI done been snaked by my own kind, so who really watchin' my back?\nKnow they want me gone, one up top, I'm a dead man if I lack\n\n[Chorus]\nBlood, sweat, and tears what I shed, sleepless nights in my bed\nThey only love when you shining, I won't let it get to my head\nGot a lil' one on the way, now I gotta do this shit for my kid\nHavin' conversations with the sky and I meant everything that I said\nFor my family, gotta build a legacy, I'ma be the man when I'm dead\nWorked too hard, I can't slip up, so I'm clutching tight on this lead\nNaw, I ain't a killer, but don't push me, I'm too close to the edge\nIs what it is, ain't no looking back, don't regret the things that I did, ayy", "year": "2019-06-07"}]}
