It didn't help me score, did it at the dances and it put me in the friend zone\nAnd if I went home, with my head down\nI lift my chin up\nThen put it down again\nUp again\nDown again\nUp again\nDown again\nNow I'm headbanging to the brand new sound again\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour body is a temple\nMy body circus ring trying to hold itself up like a tentpole\nEvery instrumental makes my pencil neck snap back fast until I'm going mental\nSome call it grinding, some call it bumping, but in the Bay we had a funny way of speaking\nIn San Francisco, we're the kids of hippies, just a bunch of geeks so we called it freaking\nIn 6th grade, freaked with a 8th hottie named Janny and I sang Kumbaya\nAmen Halllujah!\nUntil a hater chaperone came and made room for God\nIt's all good though\nTurn the anger into energy and passion tlll I'm burning like a wood stove\nI do Liquid and the Fireball\nThe only raver moves I know\nBut I'm putting on a good show", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c29f84b2362a2e43218c9c9f8eb13126.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "A New Kind of Sexy", "title": "D.A.N.C.E.
