Gang! Gang!\nThey talkin' down on my name, don't let 'em run off with the name\nMan I just run with the gang, A$AP boys came with the flame\nGang! Gang! They talkin' down on the gang\nThey wanna rep with the name but this ain't no regular name\nGang! Gang! They tryna run with the name\nI might pull up with 3K but I do not fuck with no Klans\n\n[Chorus]\nGang! Gang! Them boys not flexin' the same\nI'm done with adjustin' to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain\nGang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang\nI tell 'em don't fuck with the gang\nIt's time to fuck up the whole game!\n\n[Verse]\nCome fuck with the Mob, shout out to the Lords and the Gods\nIn love with my bitch 'cause she bi\nMy ice like the stars, I tell that bitch, \"Cover your eyes\nCause fuckin' with me, you go blind\"\nShe losin' her mind, we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde\nConvincin' my bitch to go blonde\nWas born in the dark, I kill you, you open my blinds\nOn Yams and that's word to my moms\nMargiela Madman with cases I'm still tryna beat\nA bunch of shit from a long time ago\nThe bigger they are, the harder they fall\nLike dominos, nigga, Geronimos\nWhen it's my time to go, adi\u00f3s, v\u00e1monos\nFlacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with pl\u00e1tanos\nDealing with life and its highs and lows\nI'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed\nI guess it's called livin', shit, I suppose\nI'm on my live alone, die VLONE\nAin't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes\nI'm 'bout my business but I'm alone\nI still had the vision when I was broke\nFuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes\nFlyin' out womens to boring shows\nI pray to God I don't overdose\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI put A$AP on my tat\nI put New York on the map\nI put the gang on the flames\nThey gon' remember the name\nThey robbin' boys for the chains\nI got Goyard by the sack\nI got the boof by the pack\nI fucked your boo on her back\n\n[Chorus]\nGang! Gang! Them boys not flexing the same\nI'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain\nGang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang\nI tell 'em don't fuck with the gang\nIt's time to fuck up the whole game! (Game, game, game, game)\n\n[Bridge: A$AP Rocky + Khloe Anna]\nGang, gang\nThey tryna front on the gang, they gon' remember my name\nTrue to truth somehow (Gang, gang)\nBut never truly lied at all, then and now\nThey tryna front on the gang\nTruth somehow\nGang, A$AP boys come with the flame\nBut never truly lied at all, then and now\nTrue to truth somehow\nBut never truly lied at all, then and now\n\n[Outro: Khloe Anna + Moby]\nTrue to truth somehow\nBut never truly lied at all, then and now\nTrue to truth somehow\nBut never truly lied at all, then and now\nTrue to truth somehow\nBut never truly lied at all, then and now\nTrue to truth somehow\nBut never truly lied at all, then and now\nIn my dreams, I'm dying all the time\nTrue to truth somehow\nBut never truly lied at all\nThen I wake, it's kaleidoscopic mind\nBut never truly lied at all\nBut never truly lied at all, then and now\nI never meant to hurt you (then and now)\nI never meant to lie", "year": "2018-04-05"}]}
