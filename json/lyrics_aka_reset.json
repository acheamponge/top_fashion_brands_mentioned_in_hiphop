Yeah\nTell me would you still be there if I never pulled up in white BM'?\nReebok and a icy wrist make a nigga say 'tsek to a Nike cheque\nBlaq Smith on the private jet he gon' take a snap shot of the BBS\nIf I was a throw back like drop top?\nWould you put me in a box like Papsak?\nIf I ain't had it lock like rastas?\nIf I shapa chiskop like Busta?\nNkalakatha, MDZ\nEverywhere like MTN?\nWafa-Wafa er' weekend\nShe gon' pull up in a maxi cab\n\n[Pre-Chorus: AKA]\nYou don\u2019t wanna wanna see me flex no\nI\u2019m gon' drown my sorrows in that demi sec, Jazzy Jeff\nDrinking out of the bottle like we Romeo and Juliet\nIf I lose it all tomorrow will you still be here?\n\n[Chorus: JR]\nWhy you blowing up my iPhone?\nWhy ung'buza ukuthi ngibuya nini?
