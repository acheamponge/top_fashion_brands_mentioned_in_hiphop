{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Aceyalone]\nA bunch of wild boys was hangin around at the local neighborhood saloon\nAnd some cat kept droppin quarters down in the jukebox playin all the favorite tunes\nAnd back by the bar playin cars lookin hard was big bad Solomon Jones\nAnd watchin over his luck was the love of his life his lady that was known as Simone\nWent out of the night which was dark and cold into the smoke-filled dimly lit room\nStumbled into thug who-a smelled like bud and his eyes looked high as the moon\nHe looked like a man with his foot in the grave and his lifetime 'bout to be out\nYet he slapped down some hundred dollar bills on the bar\nAnd he yelled out \"Drinks on the house\"\nNow nobody could place where this dude was from but we knew that he was far from home\nBut we drank to his health and the last to drink, was big bad Solomon Jones\nNow there's some G's who just run the streets, and they live life in and out of jail\nAnd such was he, that kind of O.G., that looked like he been through hell\nWith his hair in cornrows, a mean mug grill, like a dog whose day is done\nHe lit up the green stuff in his cigar, and he took hits one by one\nNow I got to thinkin who this cat could be, and what the hell is goin on\nYeller turned around and who was starin at him, the lady that was known as Simone\nIn the white t-shirt all stained with dirt, he was tryin not to be rude\nBut he was tryin to find another good song on the jukebox so he could just set the mood\nHave you ever been out in the city streets, where the game they play is so clear\nWhere the police and gangsters control the block, and gunshots is all that you hear?\nWhen the only sound are the drums of war, and you left out in the cold\nA half-dead man in a half-dead world, on a yellow brick road to gold\nThen all of a sudden the music changed, and everyone just held their pulse\nBut it felt like your life had been robbed from you, and everything that you held close\nThat someone had stolen the woman you loved, and that her love was a devil's lie\nThat your heart was gone, and the best thing that you could do was crawl away and die\nIt's the painful cry of a man's despair, deep down in his bones\nI guess misery enjoys company, said big bad Solomon Jones\nThen the stranger turned, and his eyes had burned in a most peculiar way\nAnd the white t-shirt that was stained in dirt, he sat down to watch it sway\nThen his mouth had frowned up in this kind of grin, and he spoke in a voice so clear\n\"Boy you don't know who I am, and I know that you just don't care\nNow I'mma say these words cause these words are true and when I'm done here I'll be gone\nBut one of you boys is a sheisty dog and his name is Solomon Jones\"\nThen I ducked my head and the lights went out, and two guns blazed in the dark\nThen a woman screamed, and the lights came on, and the two men laid stiff as starch\nWith a bullet in his head and pumped full of lead was big bad Solomon Jones\nWhile the thug from the street who was holdin his heat\nAnd holdin on to that lady named Simone", "title": "Solomon Jones", "album": "Magnificent City", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d377dd352876664b03799298f4325e48.600x600x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
