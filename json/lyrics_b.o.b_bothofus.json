I\u2019m just askin'\nWhat\u2019s the pattern to the madness?\nEverybody ain\u2019t a number one draft pick\nMost of us ain\u2019t Hollywood actors\nBut if it\u2019s all for one, and one for all\nThen maybe one day, we all could ball\nDo it one time for the underdogs\nSincerely yours, from one of y'all\n\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift]\nI wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us\nSome day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nI could feel your pain, I could feel your struggle\nYou just wanna live, but everything's so low\nThat you could drown in a puddle\nThat\u2019s why I gotta hold us up, yeah, hold us up\nFor all the times no one\u2019s ever spoke for us\nTo every single time that they play this song\nYou can say that that\u2019s what Bobby Ray wrote for us\nWhen the tides get too high\nAnd the sea up underneath gets so deep\nAnd you feel like you\u2019re just another person\nGetting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds\nUh, because we've both been there, both of us\nBut we still stand tall with our shoulders up\nAnd even though we always against the odds\nThese are the things that\u2019ve molded us\nAnd if life hadn\u2019t chosen us\nSometimes I wonder where I would've wound up\nCause if it was up to me, I\u2019d make a new blueprint\nThen build it from the ground up, hey\nBut if it\u2019s all for one, and one for all\nThen maybe one day, we all could ball\nDo it one time for the underdogs\nFrom Bobby Ray, to all of y\u2019all\n\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift]\nI wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us\nSome day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us", "title": "Both of Us", "album": "Strange Clouds", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/26b89ac0cd8c179b2aeb27a1630f21e2.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
