Gettin your punk ass stunt\nYou gon respect us or that fo' rippin through the vests\nAnd you know who you are deaf nigga'll get the message\nMalik or M-E-M-P-H Bleek\nFuck around and be a B-I-T-C-H sleek\nCuz all that yappin dude will get guns clappin dude\nAnd stop Memphis from rappin dude, huh\n\n(Chorus: The Game)\nMemph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek\nMemph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek\n\n(Verse 3: The Game)\nIt took me a little while but I am now understandin\nJay fucked up in the first round when he picked olo with candy\nDid olo in the second, nigga take it from me\nThe Roc get knocked off the bounce till you picked up beans\nAdd freeway to the team but move the ugly bitch\nTrade the Marcy reject for Cam'ron and Lil' Chris\nNow the squad 5 is live 6 man is Neef\nFans in the stand yellin out fuck Memphis Bleek\nYou want beef I have your body parts all over New York\nLeg in jersey arm in Brooklyn head buried in central park\nYou can't even ball for New York no more like John Starks\nAnd I ain't talkin to him I'm talkin to Malik\nAnd I got a pine box for a nigga like you\nStreets is talkin how many real niggas like you\nHit LAX remember when you come to the coast\nNiggas don't play with they lives when it comes to the toast\n\n(Chorus: The Game)\nMemph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek\nMemph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek"}]}
