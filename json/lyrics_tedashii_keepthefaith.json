(sure)\nLesson four can bring us more of an insight to this section (Ch. 4)\nEspecially when we start discussing the dead's resurrection (4:14-16)\nRemember Paul wrote, those who are sleeping\nThat past on\nWon't be passed over\nSo stop the grieving (4:16)\nFor if we believe in Jesus Christ and that He's still living (4:14)\nWe also believe He'll take those who are asleep as Christians (4:14)\nSo the topic of tomorrow is not my concern\nJust the fact He's coming back and that He's soon to return (4:16)\nNow with that on my mind/it makes today so crucial\nBecause the God who's coming back desires to live through you (1:5-6)\n\nYou took the word as it is\nLet His love be fruitful in (1:6)\nYour works of Faith and Love, so\nKeep the faith (1:3)\nIt'll get a little harder\nYeah, yeah (2:2)\nIt'll get a little rougher\nOh Yeah (2:14)\nBut there is hope in his promise so Keep the Faith (1:3)\n\nNow I know you wondering how this affects us today man (4:13)\nBut you need the background to be effective today man\nDo you remember lesson two when Paul called us his crown (2:19)\nHis boast before the Lord because we was holding it down (2:19-20)\nCause we heeded to the lessons that he taught to the crowd (2:13-14)\nSo much so\nWe all decided we would take our idols down (1:9)\nAnd the news begin to spread fast all over town (1:8-9)\nFrom our people to their people\nIn the towns that surround (1:8)\nWe proclaim the name of Jesus while we walking around\nAnd it's crazy cause our neighbors started following us 'round (1:6-7)\nLesson 1 gives the reason why we all in this now\nGod predestined he would save this Thessalonians town (1:4)\nHe elected us for truth and Paul strolled into town (1:5)\nWithout the Gospel as a lifeguard we all would have drown (2:13)\nIn the sins of men and trends that be bogging you down (1:9)\nWe were homeless with no family like a dog in a pound (1:4)\nTill God decided to go looking through the lost and the found (5:24)\nAnd He spared us from His wrath that He'll be calling down (1:10)\nDon't you get it?\nWe did, that's the reason why we miss him\nPaul was like our father who taught us\nAll how to be Christian (2:11)\nLike with the motherless\nHe nurtured us\nAnd showed us his vision (2:7-8)\nHe loves us\nThat's why when he prays we're constantly mentioned (1:2-3)\nSo the call for us today is we continue his mission (4:10)\nLong to lead a quiet life and to attend to your own business (lets get it)(4:11)\n\nYou took the word as it is\nLet His love be fruitful in (1:6)\nYour works of Faith and Love, so\nKeep the faith (1:3)\nIt'll get a little harder\nYeah, yeah (2:2)\nIt'll get a little rougher\nOh Yeah (2:14)\nBut there is hope in his promise so Keep the Faith (1:3)\n\nBridge:\nThere is joy in the firmness of your faith (3:7-9)\nThere is life in you embracing his grace (3:8)\nSo keep praying\nAnd rejoicing in thanksgiving, and loving in patience\nAnd just keep the faith (5:15-18)\nThere is hope in His return and that He will come (1:3,10)\nThere is peace in the promise of His love (5:23-24)\nSo keep praying\nAnd rejoicing in thanksgiving, and loving in patience\nAnd just keep the faith (5:15-18)\n\nSo in conclusion for today, I say\nContinue in faith (1:3)\nWith love/Hoping in the day\nThe Lord will snatch us away (1:3)\nBe an example for the saints that we find in Achaia (1:7)\nStanding strong\nNo matter what\nReproducing the savior\nCause the joy of a teacher is when his students can grasp it\nIt's mastered\nAnd we live on through you training up the masses (1:8)\nAnd honor you leaders\nIn love\nAppreciate their work (5:12)\nServant leaders making disciples as we create the church\nRemember to exhort and comfort to alleviate the hurt (5:14)\nAnd run from every form of evil to not deviate the church (5:22)\nThough we imitate the saints and the God that we serve (1:6)\nThere are still great afflictions that can rattle your nerves\nAnd this life will get so trife and it'll throw you a curve\nAnd there are people who live evil\nFeeding a sexual urge (4:5)\nSo be holy/living solely\nFor His glory (5:19-22)\nPossessing your body rightly in the purity that he showed us (4:3-4, 5:22)\nCause no matter how much we grow\nOr no matter how far we go\nWe still could do some more\nEven if Timothy gave a good report (3:6)\nSo lets continue to work and labor\nAnd endure in this race (4:1)\nEagerly hoping for the moment we will see His face (yeah)(1:10)\n\nYou took the word as it is\nLet His love be fruitful in (1:6)\nYour works of Faith and Love, so\nKeep the faith (1:3)\nIt'll get a little harder\nYeah, yeah (2:2)\nIt'll get a little rougher\nOh Yeah (2:14)\nBut there is hope in his promise so Keep the Faith (1:3)"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
