1]\nConsumerism running through them like a tumor in 'em\nAgeism, sexism, racism, chauvinism\nCapitalism running through them like the rumour business\nSeparatism, skepticism, modernism, atheism\nTelevision running through them like an organism\nMechanism, despotism, poisoning the ecosystem\nSatanism running through them like a politician\nHedonism, hypocrism, nihilism, narcissism\nEgotism running through them, need an exorcism\nSituation, heathenism, adversary demonism\nTo fix forms of religious spontaneity's a bad decision\nCatholicism, Darwinism, barbarism, formalism\nEuropean fetishisms, terrorism running through them on their television\nIntroversion, extra prison tolerance for bad decisions\nExploitative be the saviour to correct the system/paranoia\nSkepticism, schizophrenic, masochism\nEscapism running through them need a sedative\nMedication, complication, devastation negative\nI say devastation negative\nModernism has created modern prisons\nNeo-McCarthyisms, new colonialisms\nPessimism mess they is in\nHoodooism, hypnotism, egoism, realism, humanism, legalism\nMysticism makes decisions from a purer prism\nMagnetism, pragmatism, altruism, pacifism/idealism\nActualism, rehabilitation-ism, ostracism, skepticism\nSmall fish ball for recognition oppressor and oppres condition\nSex, addiction, next suspicion, vexed, conflict and secularism\nSee, people need to villainize to offset disdain for their lives\nUgly human, ugly shame, corporate greed in Jesus' name\nAnarchism, self-delusions\nVictims leave with no solutions\nImpositions, superstitions, violence and contradictions\nFalse pretense and no convictions\nCompromised commercialism\nI said compromised commercialism\nWorth and vision, work for wisdom\nFull electromagnetism\nWho comes first is first position\nRap's been missing you've been listening\nWatch the empress bless the system\nPaganism, false religion, plagiarism, broken system\nEuphemism unforgiven\nInhibition, prohibition, disconnection\nBroken wisdom, broken cistern can't hold wisdom\nThis town needs an exorcism\nEgotism, egotism, egotism, egotism, egotism, egotism, egotism, egotism\nAlcoholism, fascism, rationalism, national tension\nJournalism gone gestapoism poporazzo-ism\nAs the world turns in isms\nTrust eroticism, social drugs, narcotics in them\nCult existence, superstition\nRitual materialisms, serial isms\nHabitual inferior vision\nConsumerism\n\n[Hook]\nHe is, he is\nSet to, set to\nSelf-destruct, self-destruct\nHe is, he is\nToo cool, too cool\nTo be true\n\n[Verse 2]\nListen\nConsumerism running through them like a tumor in 'em\nSeparatism, skepticism, desperation, nepotism\nCapitalism running through the Montezuma in em\nAgeism, sexism, racism, fascism\nTelevision running through 'em like an organism\nHedonism, egoism, systematic narcissism\nTo empty religious spontaneity is anarchism\nSocial Darwinism, barbarism, modern paganism\nMajor schizism, division, ethnoplagiarism\nSelfish business decision, greedy reductionism\nObstruction of the justice, occupation victimizationism\nBrainwashing, mind control, synthetic stimulation in them\nTime control mutilating the soul for a business decision\nHelp the people cope sell 'em dope from a new trope\nSynthetic hope, life spent walking on a tightrope\nInfantile masturbation, juvenile, no education\nMental castration, a generation forced to labor for a nation\nLock the means production down, price reduction down\nInflation and corruption need the medication now!\nThey need the medication now!\nCorporate production in a state of mass combustion\nGreed and lust and dangerous repercussions\nTo escape the rupture they speak of rapture\nWhile still going after the things they spiritually capture\nDistaster faster and faster and faster\nTerrorism running through them on their television\nIntroversion, indecision, reactionism, hypocrism\nPhony nationalism, dishpan Africanism\nMaterial hypnotisms, monopoly, militarist devi-isms, sadomasochisms\nIntellectual fetishisms sold on computers and televisions\nExploitative need a saviour to correct the system\nParanoia skepticism, schizophrenic mechanisms\nEscapism running through them need a sedative\nMedication, complication, situation negative\nModernism has created modern prisons\nNeo-McCarthyisms, new colonialisms\nPessimism makes decisions, hoodooism, hypnotism\nEgoism, realism, humanism, legalism\nSmall fish ball for recognition oppressor and oppressed condition\nSex, addiction, vexed conflict and anarchism\nSelf-delusions, victims leave with no solutions\nImpositions, superstitions, brutism, contradictions\nFalse pretense and no convictions\nCompromised commercialism, recognition\nAny decisions from a pure prism\nMagnetism, pragmatism, altruism, actionism\nActivism, pacifism, rehabilitation-ism\nNo false sensationalism, aped assimilation in 'em\nCorporate cannibalism, psychological limitations in 'em\nNo imitations, competition, gross assumption\nParasitism, negative stimulation in 'em\nConsumerism\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist":
