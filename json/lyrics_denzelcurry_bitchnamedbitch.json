All up in her head like a kufi\nOoh wee, Denny Cascade is a cool G\nRealest nigga ever I meditate on mount Fuji\nWith a lady that resembles Lauryn Hill\nWelcome to my world, the red and blue pill\nMorpheus, really wanna know just what you're working with\nWe chop it up, we break it down\nAnd then we never work again\n\n[Hook]\nBitch, that's a bitch named bitch\nGot your bitch and my bitch\nThat's a bitch named bitch\nThat's a bitch named bitch\nThat's a bitch named bitch\nThat's a bitch named bitch\n\n[Verse 2: Yung Lean]\nRoot of all evil\nWoke up in a Martin car, my chain look medieval\nLeandoer, bitch, I\u2019ll thrash her like a Weavile\nMoney in the needle, Glock empty, re-load we know\nDrop-top in the whip fucking bad bitches\nSeeball I'm the 5th beatle, talking is my detail\nYung Lean a young fetal, smoking loud in the cathedral\nHalf an ounce of lethal, half an ounce of peaceful\nGlock to your head, pop goes the weasel\nHalf an ounce of lethal, half an ounce of peaceful\nGlock to your head, pop goes the weasel\nDank got me flying over state, counting stacks is paper\nWhere my mind running circles, certain\nIntoxicated, leave your luck to faith\nNo need to negotiate\nHide the dead bodies so we count the weight\n\n[Hook]\nBitch, that's a bitch named bitch\nGot your bitch and my bitch\nThat's a bitch named bitch\nThat's a bitch named bitch\nThat's a bitch named bitch\nThat's a bitch named bitch"}], "artist": "Denzel Curry"}
