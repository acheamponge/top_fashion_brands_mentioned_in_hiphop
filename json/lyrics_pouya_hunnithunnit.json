Irrelevant\nBitches make me sick, but I'm optimistic with the dick\nMight just drop one on you lip bitch\n\n[Chorus: Fat Nick]\nStill sippin' Act, got my migo in the kitchen\nIf you try finessin' once, then he shootin' like the Pistons\nPlug won't call me back 'cause he knows the pack go missin'\nGiuseppe steppin', trappin' and the pistol never missin'\nStill sippin' Act, got my migo in the kitchen\nIf you try finessin once, then he shootin' like the Pistons\nPlug won't call me back 'cause he knows the pack go missin'\nGiuseppe steppin', trappin' and the pistol never missin'\n\n[Verse 2: Pouya]\nI know some things I never did before but I ain't telling secrets, that's a private session\nKeep the Smith & Wesson when I'm in my session\n'Cause these rappers wanna get a piece of mine\nWhen all I really want is peace of mind\nI'ma duck your smiles, dick up 'til the sun go down in your momma\nAll I want to do is see these commas\nIn my future, Kama Sutra, doing backflips on my mattress\nBust it open be my canvas\nKnow these hoes just want to see my savage side\nI don't need the blue check, them hoes go know I'm verified\nCertified to match in scrutinizes perfection\nDon't be second-guessing me, bitch\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Pouya]\nSuck on my dick, suck on my dick\nShe said she gon' come through and she'll suck on my dick\nSuck on my dick, suck on my dick\nShe said she gon' come through and she'll suck on my dick\n\n[Chorus: Fat Nick]\nStill sippin' Act, got my migo in the kitchen\nIf you try finessin' once, then he shootin' like the Pistons\nPlug won't call me back 'cause he knows the pack go missin'\nGiuseppe steppin', trappin' and the pistol never missin'\n\n[Outro: Pouya]\nYuh, suck this dick, bitch\nHunnit Hunnit, gang shit", "year": "2015-07-24"}]}
