(tell me, tell me)\nFor real or not? (tell me, tell me)\nAre we for real or not, I gotta know\n(Tell me, tell me)\n\n[Pre-Hook: Andy Mineo]\nYou're givin' me all you have\nYou saw me without my mask\nBut I can't change my past\nSo can you promise this gon' last?\n\n[Hook: Mac Powell]\nMake me a believer\nCause all I've ever seen is pain\nMake me a believer\nPromise me I'm not the same\nMake me a believer\n\n[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]\nThey tell me seein' is believin'\nBut all ever saw was the schemin'\nAll I ever saw was the people that I loved\nThey was gettin' up and leaving, throwin' peace signs\nWhat's up, what's up, aye (tell me, tell me)\nWhat's up lately?\nHow did you love me?\nYou stayed when I went buggin', you stayed\nIt's messin' with my head now, it's messin' with my head\nWhy you haven't left now?\nI still can't guess, tell me\n\n[Refrain: Andy Mineo]\nAre we for real or not? (tell me, tell me)\nFor real or not? (tell me, tell me)\nAre we for real or not, I gotta know\n(Tell me, tell me)\n\n[Pre-Hook: Andy Mineo]\nYou're givin' me all you have\nYou saw me without my mask\nBut I can't change my past\nSo can you promise this gon' last?\n\n[Hook: Mac Powell]\nMake me a believer\nCause all I've ever seen is pain\nMake me a believer\nPromise me I'm not the same\nMake me a believer\n\n[Outro: Kelly Shahbazian]\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"}]}
