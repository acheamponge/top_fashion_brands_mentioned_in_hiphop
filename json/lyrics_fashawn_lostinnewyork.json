Never seen you around\u201d\nI reply, \u201cCalifornia, on my way uptown\u201d\nSomehow I wind up in the wrong borough\nSurrounded by seven goons and they all thorough\nOne had a gat and he cocked it\nTwo was pattin\u2019 my pockets\nThe other four sat back watchin\u2019\nSame night, met a chick in Lefrak City  with fat titties\nDrove a nigga through Queens, we blew a pack of Phillies\nTold her, \u201cI\u2019m trying to get to Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u201d\nTold me she ain\u2019t even from New York\nJust on a visit, my head\u2019s spinnin\u2019\nNeed to sit and relax, take a sip of some \u2018gnac\nFor a minute before a nigga collapse\u2014made a call\nWith a couple of coins I had left, my Blackberry and wallet gone\nNow I\u2019m vexed\u2014what the fuck?\nHow I end up in the Boogie Down BX, wanderin\u2019 \u2018round\nOutta bounds, watch your step\nI thought I heard a gunshot ring from the back of the \u2018jects\nNow I\u2019m thinking: Will I even make it back to the West?\nGod-willing, I don\u2019t get stuck in this maze of large buildings\nA thousand feet tall in this field with odd tenants\nSomehow I gather up enough change\nTo hop back on the train, almost forgot why I came\nTake a look at my watch, it\u2019s a quarter to 12\nWhat a night, what a city, \u2018nother story to tell", "title": "Lost in New York"}]}
