A-a-and then.. *laughing*\nI slip and slide through the times in my youth\nWhat's the age? Too young to worry, too old to dream\nWhat's the age? Imagination to me, tragedy to some\nWhat's the age? I guess we'll find out when we're older. Touch\u00e9\n\n[Chorus]\nI look around and I see nothing in my neighbourhood\nNot satisfied don't think I ever wanna stay for good\nPacked up my bags, told mom and dad I gotta go, go\nAnd once I do they'll finally see the enemy\n\n[Outro]\nOh\nOoh, oh, ooh, oh yeah\nOoh, ooh, oh yeah, ooh\nYeah-eah-eah-eah-eah\nOo yeah-eah-eah-eah\nOhhhh hmm\nOhhhh hmm\nHmm\nHmm\nTurf"}]}
