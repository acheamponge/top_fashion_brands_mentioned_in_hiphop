I wonder if I sold, like Kendrick or Cole\nWould you acknowledge a king when he finally get his robe?\nIgnite the universe, serenade the globe\nRedesign the Earth, rewrite the scrolls\nReverse the curse, revitalize the old\nReteach the youth, the future we all hold\nIn the palm of time, 'til we all realize\nWe're are mirrors of the Lord's design\nWe're all feel like this world is yours or mine\nI find the truth when I lost my mind\nI crossed my heart, I hope to die\nNo promoting lies, populate, socialize\nStretch your closed mind out, open wide\nPut your insecurities and your hopes aside\nAnd let's ride, no matter your coast or side\nMiddle fingers up high, all together\n\n[Chorus]\nI could say fuck the whole world\nI could say fuck the world\nBut I love the whole world but fuck the whole world x2\nUh huh\nI love the whole world but fuck the whole world x2\n\n[Verse 3]\nI gave Mother Earth the keys and let her drive me insane\nIf I die, ghost ride through the lane, uh-huh\n140 characters ain't enough\nTo turn your pain into art, got to paint your brush\nUh, turn mysteries, pays to us\nRepetitive noise, nothing's changed too much\nStill ignoring the poor, still going to war\nStill killing each other, still don't know what for\nI had a vision too Utopian\nFor YouTube, wouldn't fit in the Fallopian\nUh, if we unite every ethnicity\nWe could ignite electricity\nShine a light so bright, we could see it from the heavens\nChurch, we ain't even need a reverend\nA crescent moon with a star or a seven\nEverything, everyone, and all be connecting\n\n[Chorus]\nI could say fuck the whole world\nI could say fuck the world\nBut I love the whole world but fuck the whole world x2\nUh huh\nI love the whole world but fuck the whole world x2", "title": "F.T.W."}]}
