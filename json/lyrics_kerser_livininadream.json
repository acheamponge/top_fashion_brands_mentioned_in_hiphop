Don't understand\nThat when you're high and at the top\nAnd come from nothing you have to plot\nYou have to brag cause they all laugh\nAnd you're on stage and living large\nHope that paints a picture bruh\nYou still hating? Couldn't give a fuck\nPositive vibes, on the beach\nWith my girl and we outta reach\nHaters dead, ain't allowed to speak\nI made it too where we happened to be?\nPhew...\nThought I was lost for a bit right there\nLucky I stuck to this shit god damn\nMe and my girl got outta there\nRolling up that good shit\nMixing up that good mix\nMoney in the bank I'm good bitch\nI can see the future it looks sick\n\n[Hook:]\nPile up that green\nNotes thick and mean\nLiving in a dream\nCame true cause I'm me\nStill smoking weed on a plane counting cash\nAin't no time to hate on no one, let me just go get smashed\nI'm rolling with my brothers\nWe all come up from nothing\nParadise we laughing\nGold on the neck never tuck it\nI made it, I made it\nSitting here all faded\nNever be outdated\nI'm gonna let the fake hate it\n\n[Verse 2:]\nI'm gonna make you chill cunts\nIt's kinda like a pill does\nI got the gift, you feel buzzed\nWe smoking on them real buds\nI fell asleep on my plane ride\nWoke up, gotta stay high\nThen I gotta hit that stage right\nI'm blinded by the stage lights\nWhat a life to live huh?\nUps and downs but I need a\nBit of space, a breather\nI don't wanna leave the game either\nI live for rap, no giving back\nWhat I work so hard for picture that\nStarted with nothing but a broken pen\nBut I made the pen the focus again\nThrough all the shit, all the drugs\nAll the hate, all the love\nThey call us up, better warn the cunts\nThat I'm staying up the top till' I'm bored as fuck\nCh-yea...\nAnd we out around, every single state the crowd is out\nI got the gift, it's all the Kers\nABK we rose from the dirt\n\n[Hook:]\nPile up that green\nNotes thick and mean\nLiving in a dream\nCame true cause I'm me\nStill smoking weed on a plane counting cash\nAin't no time to hate on no one, let me just go get smashed\nI'm rolling with my brothers\nWe all come up from nothing\nParadise we laughing\nGold on the neck never tuck it\nI made it, I made it\nSitting here all faded\nNever be outdated\nI'm gonna let the fake hate it"}], "artist": "Kerser"}
