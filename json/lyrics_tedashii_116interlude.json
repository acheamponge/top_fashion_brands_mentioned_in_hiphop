AKA T.dot. What it do?\n\nCheck it out man, I just want to share my heart on this thing, called 116\n\nIt comes from the scripture Romans 1:16. It says\n\nFor I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, first for the Jew and also for the Greek\n\nSo what that simply means to me is this. It's the Gospel of God that's the power of salvation, so, it doesn't take you plus the Gospel, your fancy words plus the Gospel, your cool dress plus the Gospel - it simply just takes the Gospel. All we are called to do is to be faithful to share it. In the scripture before this, we see Paul telling the people \"I'm ready to preach to you that are in Rome.\" Simply put man, be ready to preach to those around you. Don't worry about all the rest, because the Gospel is the power unto salvation. So just be faithful to preach it. Even if it sounds foolish man, be faithful to preach it. God is powerful enough, so lets represent him well y'all\n\nIt's your boy T.Dot - I'm out"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
