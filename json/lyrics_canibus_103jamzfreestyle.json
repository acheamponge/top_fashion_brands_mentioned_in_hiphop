Got \u2018F'-ed up \u2018cause you shouldn't have stood up\nSweeter than a handful of granulated sugar\nNiggas running they mouth like I can't get to them\nBut watch the shit hit the fan when that cat Can pull up\nNo question, get wrecked in less than a nanosecond\nFor messing with me or my brethren\nYou can't stop aggression, you can't hold back what's destined\nAnd you definitely can't coach perfection\nBe the only nigga standing after Armageddon\nTake a hammer and smash the stone your name was etched in\nThen I'll announce that I'm running for the new election\nAnybody with an objection gets the death-sentence\nDeath by lethal-injection, death by being beheaded\nDeath by getting shot with a weapon, but if you\nWant to be remembered then death by getting\nYour head severed is an honorable way to end it\n\n[Interlude: Canibus]\n\n103 Jams\nIt's the Canibus Man\nBlackin' out for ya'll\nYeah, one time\nThis is how we do\nOn the M-I-C when we MC brain cell never M.D\n\nYo\nIf I said it once, I say it a thousand times\nI've got thousands of rhymes, the rechargeable alkaline kind\nYou want a piece of mine? Fine, we can take it outside\nOtherwise your wasting your time\n\u2018Cause I'm gonna shine past the one-triple-nine\nNiggas gamble and damage their eyes\nGoing blind trying to keep up with these lyrical lines\nType of nigga you can't flow behind without a dope rhyme\nMess around and get clothes-lined \u2018till you nose-dive\nWe can rhyme fair-and-square or fair in a sphere\nAnyplace, anywhere ya'll niggas ain't got a prayer\n\u2018Cause Doomsday is near, faggot niggas is scared\nThey stand and stare as I appear upon a cushion of air\nWith a long-white beard flaming\nHot enough to sunburn Satan\nHotter than white people taking vacation\nOut in Virginia, out in the sun baking\nSun baking in gamma-ray radiation \u2018till they skin color look Cajun\nMother-fuckers start aging \u2018till the point where they faces shrivel up like raisins\nAnd they become cancer patients\nThis is how we do it when we chilling in the V-A\nCan-I-Bus getting busy on the P-A\nSystem, yeah, I get in \u2018em\nWith a lyrical algorithm liable to kill \u2018em\nMy style will get in \u2018em, way up in \u2018em\nFace don't belong on the Source, it should be on the Shroud of Turin for certain\nGrab mics and murder shit\nAs wicked as Satan worshippers going to Catholic Church services\nYou heard of this new lyrical verbalist\n\n[(written by silvaski:) When I came across this page, all the lyrics below were here.  The youtube video for the audio that was linked on this page had been deleted, so I found a replacement audio to put in it's place, however the audio contained only the above lyrics.  I don't know if the below lyrics were part of the original video, or if they were just pasted here by mistake, so I left them there and annotated them with redirecting links to the songs that they were incorporated into]\n\nYo, yo, yo\nI kick a verse at six hundred and sixty-six megahertz\nMake lightening flash across the sky every time I curse\nSix hundred and sixty-six flashes\nGive out six hundred and sixty-six lashes\nTo the backs of six hundred and sixty-six Masters of Ceremony has-beens\nPut a crown of thorns on whoever the king of rap is\nIf he's a Catholic I'll nail him to a crucifix\nThen I'll beat him \u2018till he's blackish-blueish\nThen perform acupuncture with six hundred and sixty-six toothpicks\nBeat him with two whips with pieces of broken glass glued to it\nYour whole crew get spayed and neutered\nAs soon as I aim and shoot it you get slayed with bullets\nYour armored cars and your Kevlar vests is useless\nI'm going to hit all of you pussies like group sex //"}]}
