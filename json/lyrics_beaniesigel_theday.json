Good\n\n[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]\nDay of Judgement, God Is calling\nUnderneath the war pigs crawling\nBegging mercies for their sins\nSatan laughing, spreads his wings\nOh Lord, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/356ca6b0db6d8d8b7be50568bdfb53c0.700x695x1.jpg", "year": "2007-12-11", "title": "The Day", "album": "The Solution"}]}
