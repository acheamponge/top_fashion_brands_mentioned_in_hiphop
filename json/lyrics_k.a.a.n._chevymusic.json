I'm that one\nHold on my depression, suppress it with the finest dark rum\nPut the light punch, can I pipe when I'm fightin' these lies\nMan I might be rollin' till five\nGot tears keep rollin' down my eyes\nWhat a surprise!\nI keep pushin' till the CD stops right at the lane\nFeel like I'm swingin' my Caprice a problem night at the day\nI'm flippin' cops off when I see em, holla fuck em, they all one and the same\nThey took like two shots, aiming one at the brain, so insane\n\n[Chorus: K.A.A.N]\nI push my Chevy to the left, I'm not focused\nMy burdens heavy, could've guessed, you don't notice\nI push my Chevy to the left, I'm not focused\nYour curse has left me with the stress now I own it\n\n[Verse 2: K.A.A.N]\nI hydroplane, I'm swervin'\nStay in my lane, no mergin'\nHop out the whip and serve it\nThen grab a vick escape quick\nRoll up the shit and blaze it\nFace forward for forward progress\nWhat's filled with dope to content\nInhale the flowers essence\nBut never would come out with intentions\nSlick as all my transitions\nGot dry with this transmission\nFlashin' lights I'm transmittin'\nSendin' signals, see the signs\nShit is sick as cyanide\nFast collision, fresh mind, end up and see the cyanide\nI float and glide, you drag and slide\nNow I describe, possessed by \"I\"\nNo veil nor wife, these squares beside themselves blowin' smoke like a Newport\nI can't prevent through\nNever land will one plan that was get mine\nAt all cost no love lost\nI pushed on, got slept on, like futons\nGot fed up then moved on\nI fell down, got back up, nigguh\n\n[Chorus: K.A.A.N]\nI push my Chevy to the left, I'm not focused\nMy burdens heavy, could've guessed, you don't notice\nI push my Chevy to the left, I'm not focused\nYour curse has left me with the stress now I own it"}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
