Like Boston George?\nYou want some more, for you and your whores?\nI kick off wars, and get behind walls\nAnd corporate doors, executive nose sore\nRich man high, eight balls and quarters\nThey call me, placing they orders\nBring me across the border, buyin the cake\nBefore I'm sold, they take the taste\nSnortin habit, not worth affordin\nSome use me, strictly out of boredom\nI hooked people before man, I warned them\nI took many people out before them\nDoing my job, connected wit the mob\nGot President Bush, Whitney, and Bob\nMany others all walks of life have one on ones with me every night\n\n[Chorus: Andre Nickatina]\nAyo for yayo\nWalk around with yayo\nAll in my nasal\nI must have been craze yo\nAyo for yayo\nWalk around with yayo\nAll in my nasal\nI must have been craze yo\nAyo for yay-e-o\nWalk around with yay-e-o\nAll in my nasal\nI must have been craze yo\nAyo for yay-e-o\nWalk around with yay-e-o\nAll in my nasal\nI must have been craze yo"}]}
