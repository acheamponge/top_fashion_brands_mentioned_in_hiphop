Nah they wasn't bringing trash out\nLike that posse out in Brooklyn we would mash out\nBody builder I be slinging weight around\nTell Ben Affleck I got something to wake the town\nSee I made it 'round, yeah make it round\n25 wholesale, 43 you break it down\n\n[Chorus: Sen City]\nLet us know cooking low I don't need consignment\nI'm going dime after dime\nCorner stoops get the coupes yellow bones piling\nI'm going dime after dime\nYeah, the fiends gon' be waiting\nDime after dime\nYeah, the fiends gon' be waiting\nDime after dime\n\n[Verse 3: Cam'ron]\nThe aux'll cut you, cops'll cuff you\nBlocks are rough too, Lenox Ave\nBroads get snatched up, dudes get clapped up\nThe whole neighborhood trapped up, your Lieutenant grab\nSoon as I came down weigh pounds\nHitting up the same town lay down\nBy any means, AM track, Peter Pan\nGreyhound made round\nI'll sold it anywhere\nWalmart, project building, playground\nI'll be everywhere\nWest, Midwest, up North, way down\nBut you will respect me, still protects me\nStill come check me, no wholesale\nYou can't dissect me or redirect me\nDon't talk directly or no sale\n\n[Chorus: Sen City]\nLet us know cooking low I don't need consignment\nI'm going dime after dime\nCorner stoops get the coupes yellow bones piling\nI'm going dime after dime\nYeah, the fiends gon' be waiting\nDime after dime\nThe fiends gon' be waiting\nDime after dime"}]}
