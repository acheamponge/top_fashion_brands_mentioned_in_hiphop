How does Moses make his tea?\nHebrews it... stupid, then on Sunday Domingo produce it\nI tutor English in an English Tudor to English students\nAcupuncture Buddhist, all inclusive pinch a nudist\nThink you can do this? You think you can make rap music\nWithout being betrayed by Judas, I think you foolish\nAnyways Hallelujahs good luck to yous\nAnd I pray you find favor in the best future\n\n[Verse 2: Seven Spherez]\nSymbolic inscriptions, encrypting demonic afflictions\nKnowledge of wisdom, I spit this shit with philosophical picture\nFeel the prophet's conviction with [?] depictions\nSeven [?] from metatronical scriptures"}]}
