It's your man again\nNo fakeness, cornball, or shenanigans\nReal talk, comin from the thoroughest\nBroke bread with Brooklyn nappy borough kids\nTime after time you tried to stop my rhyme\nBut I'm all chest and heart and you got no spine\nI was born to lead, you was born to bleed\nYouse a slowpoke nigga so I move with speed\nUpdate - you higher and you can't be found\nI heard you and your man was suckin dicks out of town\nYou throw dirt we shovel that shit back\nAnd when we catch your lil' ass we gon' snap your back\nOne thing, I just can't understand\nYou got a big mouth for a little-ass man\nTry to leave me hangin, without the rope\nI got enough rope to leave your punk-ass choked\nYou know me, I don't speak just to scare you\nYou know my resume and the things that I do\nLike, punch cats, in they solar plex'\nLeave nasty holes, in they face and they chest\nWhen you get the message, give me a call\nAnd we'll meet up and I'll kick you, dead in the balls\nCall me back BITCH, call me back~!\nYeah... {*hangs up phone*}"}], "artist": "Big Shug"}
