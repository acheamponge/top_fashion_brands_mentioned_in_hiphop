Diesel production\n\n[Chorus: Pimp C]\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nI'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nI'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine\n\n\n[Verse 1: Pimp C]\nR.I.P. to Robert Davis, he the king of the south\nAnything else said, need to shut your fucking mouth\nI'm down with Lil' Flip, and I'm down with T.I.P\nIf them niggas come together, know how much paper we could see?\nSlim Thug and Z-Ro, y'all still bullshitting\nNeed to sit down, take a tour, there's too much money to be get\nPaul Wall and that Koopa still ain't talking\nMoney speak, all that bullshit keep walking\nY'all niggas got the game fucked up\nAll you record company people need to shut the fuck up (Shut the fuck up)\nCause y'all keeping up that bullshit rapping\nThe white people laughing at 'em, that's what's happening\nThe same stupid ass niggas still ain't figured it out\nLong as they stay divided, man we gon' run the south\nY'all need to get up out the dumb shit\nI got a bread truck, get up out that crumb shit, nigga\n\n[Chorus: Pimp C]\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nI'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nI'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine\n\n[Verse 2: P.O.P.]\nHey, I got the bass quaking, trunk shaking like tambourines\nIn the H, where them paints sweet as tangerines\nWhere they bouncing on fours like trampolines\nIt's the great state of Texas so I can't believe\nAll the conflict and plex that we carrying\nIt's time to get rid of the beef like vegetarians\nI'm 'bout stacking bank, everyday\nSo I pay attention to the vets and I ain't talking 'bout a Chevrolet\nKeke the Don, Pimp C a king\nLil' J, the owner of the squad, H-Town, we the team\nIt ain't no I in that, you trying that, you be fatigued\nBut if we man up and press, we could lead the league\nWe some all-stars, the roster is sick, man\nI ain't gotta start, P.O.P.'ll be the sixth man\nRap-A-Lot's a southern empire for the assist, man\nThree, two, one, swish, and\n\n[Chorus: Pimp C]\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nI'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nI'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine\n\n[Verse 3: Lil' Keke]\nYou see the slab outside, it look good, don't it?\nMasterpiece, dripped out with the fours on it,\nTrunk airtight, speakers and them show lights\nHolding, cops around, nigga get your shit tight\nLet me tell you the meaning of coming through\nWhen the seats off-cream and the candy is dark blue\nApproaching downtown, knocking doors down\n10-11 slabs in a single-file line\nFlossing, swerving, the rims is glistening\nThey gotta see the wood cause the top is missing\nI sleep on dreams cause it's paper I'm chasing\nMy roots come from Texas, this Pimpalation\nThe barre is tasty, the Benz is spacey\nI gotta show my class so these haters can face me\nRiding up the boulevard, crushing the sidewalk\nShowing my surround while I'm knocking the doors off\n\n[Interlude] (Music Video)\nIs this true you're part of the largest mob family in Texas?\nThen what are you here for\n\n[Verse 4:Pimp C] (Music video only)\nSince I drop Knockin Doorz boys sort it out\nSeen the light, want the paper, can't live it out\nZ-Ro and Young Thug in the studio\nThey already platinum you already know\nMike Jones and Koopa they done shook hands\nYou can lay a plex aside if you a real man\nI think that Paul and Chamillionaire talking but ain't rapping yet\nIt's a start though, we knockin down doorz\nTI and Flip still on that boy stuff\nActing like kids, that ain't what time is it\nI know you don't like what I'm telling you\nBut I keep trill, fuck what you feel, that's what I'm telling you\nStop listening what your homeboy selling you\n'Cause when pop off, they gon' be bailing fool\nAnd you gon' be alone when you catch the case\nSo watch your mouth and get that stupid look out your face\n\n[Chorus: Pimp C]\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nI'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nI'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine\n\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nI'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cause around\nI'ma, I'ma come through and show my wood pine\n\nKnocking, knocking doors down, showing 'cuz around\nKnocking doors down, showing 'cuz
