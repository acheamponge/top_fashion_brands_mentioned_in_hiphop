Music", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nI gotta get out of here, this city\u2019s gonna kill me\nCould be anywhere\nAnywhere but here\nI wonder how long before this shit gone take me under\n\n[Verse 1]\nMoving through New York City in a black seven fifty\nLike Batman movin through Gotham\nDodging pot holes as I gently move through Harlem with my wheels on slalom\nPain in my eyes as I'm passing the place\nWhere they found Sean Bell and they shot him (Queens)\nForty one times, he committed no crime\nBut I guess life ain't Times Square\nBut in the city that\u2019s gritty where the bottom lives shitty\nAnd the mayor\u2019s a billionaire\nYou learn Manhattan keep on making it\nAnd Brooklyn, keep on taking it\nCause life just ain't that fair\nFor the kids in the park, watching out for the Narcs\nBlowing Sour Diesel in the air\nTryin' to flip them a pack, stack up a couple racks\nAnd make it the hell outta here\u2026 (New York)\n\n[Hook]\nLet the city peel away right from under you\nThere are too many ghosts in this town\nI can hear them calling out to me, out to me, out to me\nI can hear them calling out\n\n[Bridge]\nLet the city peel away\nThere were too many ghosts in this town\nI can hear them calling out to me, out to me!\n\n[Verse 2]\nI maneuver through the ATL in a black SL\nWith the goddess of a black female\nThis is black male Heaven with the ballers are professing\nBut to me home feels like Hell\nEven though it\u2019s black top from the mayor to the cops\nBlack blood still gets spilled\nThey raided a house, no drugs were ever found\nBut a black grandmother laid killed\nLike the dream of the King when the sniper took his life\nOn the balcony of Lorraine Motel\nFrom now forthward, these young black boys\nSeem to self-sabotage they selves\nOr maybe they're just smart, and they choose to go hard\nCause they know the good guy will fail\nSo you ask what happens to a dream deferred\nLangston, well it kills itself... (Atlanta)\n\n[Hook]\nLet the city peel away right from under you\nThere are too many clouds in the sky\nI can hear them calling out to me\nI can hear them calling out\nAnywhere but here"}]}
