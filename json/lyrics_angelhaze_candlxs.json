That's a definite yes\nStarlight, the beauty, the visage is bliss\nNature, you're gloomy, perception is lit\nI can see you and me, struggling beautifully\nPaint the whole scene with good head and good, uh\n(Just can we dance forever?)\n(C-c-can we dance forever?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI think I'm obsessed with you\nIf the world was ending soon\nI don't think that I could take it\nYo, what's the point in messing around\nIf we both know what we've found\nForever, baby, we could make it\nYou say\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nIt's human nature, we all are dying\nBut I'm still burning bright and blue\nIf we're in danger, if time is flying\nIf so, we'll both be lifeless soon\n\n[Chorus] (x2)\nLet the candles burn slow\nForever young, I wanna be\nIn this moment\nOh, we're just making too much love\nTill heaven calls, it's just me and you only\n\n[Post-Chorus] (x2)\nLet them candles burn slow\nOh, them candles burning\nOh, them candles burning\n\n[Verse 3]\nI took you where the leaves are bright\nFall is your favorite season, right?\nI don't think I heard you clearly\nYo, I can barely sleep at night\nFunny, you the reason why\nI don't think you need to fear me\nWe should\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nWe should keep dancing, we should keep trying\nWe should keep burning bright and blue\nOh, we're in danger cause time is flying\nAnd soon we'll both be lifeless too\n\n[Chorus x2] + [Post-Chorus x2]\n\n[Bridge]\nYou told me you ain't wanna do it\nSaid love was for stupid people and cupid\nI swore to you that I could make you lose it\nAnd now I got you dancing to my music\nGot you dancing to my music\nGot you dancing to my music\nShake it, make it, move it\nGot you dancing to my music\nGot you dancing to my music\nGot you dancing to my music\nShake it, make it, move it\nGot you dancing to my music\n\n[Chorus x2] + [Post-Chorus x2]", "year": "2015-02-02"}]}
