What you mean, us?\"\nKing Kers, smooth cunt with a rough side\nCunts try go against us and you must die\nStill sell big like \"See, they know me\"\nIn Australia I'm G.O.A.T\n\n[Chorus]\nI can feel you in my heart\nYou in my heart\nOhh\nYou can feel it in your heart, oh\nI can feel you in my heart\nYou in my heart\nOhh\nYou can feel it in your heart, oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nI had the elevator reekin' like pot smoke\nWhat, bro? I ain\u2019t gettin\u2019 off 'till the top, yo\nSmooth rapper, I am really the hot-spot\nCould have your dream girl, let me hit her with the box shots\nScot\u2019s not here to drop shots at you soft cocks\nI'm here to chop crops, what you mean about the top spot?\nThere's no debate with this shit anymore\nTry blockin' out the Kers but I\u2019ll kick in the door\nLet me get to the facts, look, the bitches love me\nThey get angry at the thought that my missus fucks me\nKers One put the 'S' with the line through it\nDollar sign, on the climb, that's how I do it\nIf we talkin' the present\nI run with the crew but never walk with a peasant\nYou feel it in your heart, though\nYou ain't in love, you just love that I'm a star, yo\n\n[Chorus]\nI can feel you in my heart\nYou in my heart\nOhh\nYou can feel it in your heart, oh\nI can feel you in my heart\nYou in my heart\nOhh\nI can feel you in my heart\nYou in my heart\nOhh\nYou can feel it in your heart, oh\nI can feel you in my heart\nYou in my heart\nOhh"}], "artist": "Kerser"}
