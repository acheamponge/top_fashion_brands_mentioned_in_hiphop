Go blow your brains out to it\nFlorida's finest, you'll find us inside that broke down hoopty\nPeople in front of my face\nBut they really wanna bust a hole in my back\nI been on go for a minute\nBut they really wanna move me off of my track\nYeah, I got a bitch but I still got a 1000 nasty hoes on my sack\nUnderground Underdog, a hunnid racks flexin'\nBut still roam with the rats\n\n[Chorus: Pouya]\nBullets fly, legs buckle, bodies pile to the sky\n1000 rounds will lay you down, we got enough to go around\nYou fuck with me, yuh (You fuck with me)\nYuh, I pull up and make it a scene (I pull up and make it a scene)\nYuh, yuh, I pull up and bust out the beam (I pull up and bust out the beam)\nBullets fly, legs buckle, bodies pile to the sky\n1000 rounds will lay you down, we got enough to go around\nYou fuck with me, yuh (You fuck with me)\nYuh, I pull up and make it a scene (I pull up and make it a scene)\nYuh, yuh, I pull up and bust out the beam (I pull up and bust out the beam)", "year": "2017-03-20"}]}
