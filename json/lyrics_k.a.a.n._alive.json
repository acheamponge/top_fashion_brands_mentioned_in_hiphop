nigga\nUh huh (3x)\nLawd\n\n[Hook]\nTook a hit and nigga I feel revived\nLet my lines engulf your mind and bring your conscience alive\nMan I see red & blue behind me put the blunt to the side\nBitch I'm terrified I'm falling off it's fuck them all till I die\n\n[Verse 1]\nPain is a weapon I used to wager\nWon't take hand-outs, you can save your favor\nNot saving face for some sort of look\nI mean for goodness sake I'm like an Adventist\nSeven days, I'll make it paint repentance\nMy pistol flow is on automatic\nIt's amazing baby, I'm a story teller\nMore Edgar Allan with the content\nMy lyrical structure it must be intelligent\nPattin' myself on the back with malevolence\nPracticin' patiently, work on the melodies\nI got no time for your cynical energy\nAll the negativity that you're sending me\nIsn't it funny to show insecurities\nHonestly, homie, that's shit's not concernin' me\nPay attention you can see me ignorin' it\nFloorin' the gas like I just hit the pedal\nLet me display and I'm sure you ain't ready\nHeavy heart, I wear it right on my sleeve\nMy shit is honest I'll never deceive\nAin't to need to reprieve, I'm a constant, I get it\nLiteral literary lyric library\nI get a shot and it seems absurd\nOh my-my-my nigga, yeah that's my word\nWorkin' to get everything we deserve\nDon't say no rumors, it's fuck what you heard\nI elevated the words from these lames\nYour shit is shallow so we're not the same\nI got theories on theories on theories\nMy shit is deep\nLet a nigga try me, man I wish it would\nRazor blade on my tongue like a blunt to rip\nIt's a shame what happened to that nigga flip\n\n[Hook]\nTook a hit and nigga I feel revived\nLet my lines engulf your mind and bring your conscience alive\nMan I see red & blue behind me put the blunt to the side\nBitch I'm terrified I'm falling off it's fuck them all till I die\n\n[Verse 2]\nMan I see the serpents lurkin'\nYou assume that I assert the certain service\nMy wordsmith skills are sure, it's certain\nMan please, you ain't even scratch the surface\nIf a nigga ever met you in person\nI come with a list of critiques\nAll hell give me praise I'm a king\nBow down, let me press this beseech\nBe attentative like a presidential speech\nI'm a certified servant for the soul\nI'm about to get fast, let y'all have it\nIn my terradome young B.Rabbit\nAt the bus stop rhymes that I wrote on a paper napkin\nSpit a flow like Pap, beats go boom-bap\nIn a rubber nigga when he spit he don't do that\nI cannot choke when I step on the stage\nTrain was derailed but I got it on track\nFull speed ahead so there's no turnin' back\nFuck a Papa Doc, shit is popular, I'm probably going a different direction\nReturn the hoe like the bitch in [?]\nSet the bar to be the best never barred\nBought the bat I beat the beast that I be\nWith defeat any plea, I'm not pleasin' the feeble\nI couldn't conjure the gift for the Gods\nSelf-medication's they're hearing a flaw\nMy deprivation is making it hard\nMy dedication is now paying off\nI could have got with the [?] but I made a way\nShit we did it again, I'm an innovator\nMinin' up like Warren G the regulator\nRest in peace to Nate Dogg, I'mma see you later\n\n[Hook]\nTook a hit and nigga I feel revived\nLet my lines engulf your mind and bring your conscience alive\nMan I see red & blue behind me put the blunt to the side\nBitch I'm terrified i'm falling off it's fuck them all till I die\n\n[Verse 3]\nI knew a nigga with a 64' impala on spokes\nYou feel the base is bumpin' heavy, alpine to the max\nYou hear the bitch a mile away playin' D.R.E\nThey probably knockin' through the system, got that hoe on repeat\nYou whip the corner, hit a left\nYou ran a red like right by 32\nWe hit the blunt and check the rear view\nState-troops in hot pursuit\nMade a quick detour in case they drive us\nSwervin', and mergin' amongst the traffic\nOn most case chase would have ended tragic\nMade three more rights till it's straight and narrow\nGot four Lb's in the trunk awaitin'\nAnd five cigarillos in the ash tray\nBeen in a sixty minute high speed chase\nIn front of seven chargers with the flashing lights\nIt's like eight miles to get to 95\nAnd if you do the math and add all the numbers\nThat I just said, it's like fifty years\nI can't do the time but then I veer right\nTo oncoming lights\nThen wrap the whip around a telephone pole\nOut of control, the young foot patrol can't find a way\nThere's no place to hide but he far from stranded\nKnew the landscape, the route, he planned it\nRan for a minute then he sat in silence\nStill surrounded but they can't find him\nSaid fuck the whip, I ain't think about it\nLawd\n\n[Hook]\nTook a hit and nigga I feel revived\nLet my lines engulf your mind and bring your conscience alive\nMan I see red & blue behind me put the blunt to the side\nBitch I'm terrified i'm falling off it's fuck them all till I die"}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
