{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Hook: D-Loc]\nNow mama never told me it would be this way\nA hard lived nigga, so I had to find out the hard way\nAnd I shoulda seen it comin'\nI was startin'\nTo think you don't see, eyes closed, mouth runnin'\nI shoulda seen it comin'\n\n[Verse 1: TraytL]\nAye, I left home at the age fourteen\nThought it was slick, like momma didn't know a damn thing\nSee, you wanna be grown, I'm a go on and let him be\nNo matter what, you can always come back here with me\nMan, she knew what kind of hood my cousin Faye lived in\nPlus I can't get into shit that I'm already in\nAll the niggas in the hood and niggas I hang with\nStayed fresh everyday and got paid in grip\nAnd I'm lookin' like Lil Bunny from slang by the bail\nWearin' JcPenny clothes, lookin' lame as hell\nSo I came up with a way for me to make me some meal\nCause I'm all cold fronting, I need a ounce of Yayo\nAnd the money came in bills like bails of hay\nGot knocked doin' paper cause where I am today. (Where you stay?)\nI'm back at the crib, but my mama found it only drama, she took me back in\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: D-Loc]\nI know the lows might get ugly sometimes\nI shoulda did what my momma told me\nBut instead, I chose to do my thing\nI never seen a sign until my time came\nHead hard as wood, won't listen\nSpent a little time in prison\nNow I'm standin' at the Crossroads\nA life out of sight, didn't know what I was in for\nI tried to make a change, but still the same mistakes\n\n[Verse 3: Dirt Dawg]\nStrap on your backpack, grab your lunch box and pencils\nDirt Dawg gon' take all y'all to school\nAin't it ironic, karma repeats herself your whole childhood\nBut you had to grow up to find out it was true\nNow I'm the same age she was, when she tried to learn me something\nAnd I find myself telling my kids the same thing too\nLife is redundant, they don't listen like I did\nBut I know they are a blessing, so I pray and have some patience too\nPlus I'm older now, wrap my son up in the hand me downs\nJacket of love cause the world is colder now\nAnd I'm a hold him down for free, like momma did me\nTil' he's old enough to start his own family tree\nSee, time repeats its self, so like I did my mom\nHe'll probably call my house one day, asking me how to raise a family\nSon, your grandmomma didn't raise no fool\nI ain't raisin one neither, just be a believer\n\n[Hook]", "album": "The Struggle ", "year": "2007-06-08", "title": "Seen it Comin", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f40498a49b0ab1575fa88857744c3a79.572x572x1.png"}], "artist": "D-Loc"}
