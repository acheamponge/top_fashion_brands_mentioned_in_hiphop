I'm sucka-free\n\n[Hook] 2X\n\n(Joe)\nBack up your work, hit the block and pitch\nDon't stop 'til you rich, cause shots never snitch\nStick to the script, tuckin' the chain\nEverything's everything\n\n(AZ)\nSee times don't stop, and crime won't stop\nSo I won't stop til I'm sittin' on top\nTo every home phones and cells get blocked\nAnd every hard top get chop til we drop\nIf the streets don't get us, the peace gon' get us\nWait til the lord they don't hit us\nI'm so iffy, keep the 'dro sticky\n(???) fifty, come and smoke with me\nBring some cups in the clubs and toast with me\nSos' the most crispy, man I flow sippy\nAnd the last Griffin, play chef in the kitchen\nBack shots, ass in the air, best position\n\n(Joe)\nThat's how we ball, that's how we bang\nEverybody do your thang\n\n[Hook] 2X\n\n(Joe)\nBack up your work, hit the block and pitch\nDon't stop 'til you rich, but shots never snitch\nStick to the script, tuckin' the chain\nEverything's everything\n\n[Hook and Joe's verse] til music fade", "year": "2001-06-12"}]}
