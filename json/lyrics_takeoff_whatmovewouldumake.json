What move would you make?\nWhat move would you do?\nEvery move got to be a power move, momma said they watching you\nWhat if the plug gave you a whole bag\nAnd you remix it with dog food\nWhat move would you do, If the plug told you he after you\n\n[Verse 1: Takeoff]\nYoung Takeoff, call me NASA\nYoung nigga, I know you remember him\nLast nigga try to steal my Cuban link\nHis family do not remember him\nLast nigga ran off in my trap spot\nI\u2019m tripping, ain\u2019t nobody tried that\nBoom boom boom! Pull out the FN, they having a heart attack\nGraduated from quarters but I throw that work like a quarterback\nRun with the sack like a running back\nI keep the wood like a lumberjack\nI turn your fitted cap to a snapback\nIf it\u2019s a problem, we pull up undelay\nYou think you hard cause of that tat on your face?\nYou think I\u2019m intimidated\nWhat the fuck is you thinking, what move was you thinking bout making?\n\n[Hook: Takeoff]\nWhen that hundred round drum at your face\nI got one question for you, what move would you make?\nIf it\u2019s a shootout in the club and you got your pocket rocket\nI got one question for you, what move would you make?\nWhat move would you make?
