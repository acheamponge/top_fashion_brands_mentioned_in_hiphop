Keeping men keeping on the run\nGuns keep it fun? Keeping men keeping on the run\nGuns keep it fun? Keeping men keeping on the run\nGuns keep it fun? Keeping men keeping on the run\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf oil is the god then the cranes all pray\nThe crude is so rude\nCoz it makes the people pay\nOn the side of the road men make money\nA flower for a dollar man\nHe wants a family\nIf I rose to power\nIt'll be a bouquet\nEmoji a smiley\nAnd say your ok\nThe tech dudes are the only ones having a good day\nAnd talking is cheap\nCoz they make it easy\n\n[Hook]\nA platform here's a train of thought\nGetting to the right side of me is why I fought\nI'm gonna say what I really got\nMaybe there's glory in all the things I'm not\n\n[Bridge]\nGuns keep it fun? Keeping men keeping on the run\nThose who love heat, yeah here comes the sun\nPower to the people yeah the light is never done\nSwitch on for the bitches yeah electricity bun\n\n[Hook]\nA platform here's a train of thought\nGetting to the right side of me is why I fought\nI'm gonna say what I really got\nMaybe there's glory in all the things I'm not", "year": "2016-09-09", "album": "AIM", "title": "Platforms"}], "artist": "M.I.A."}
