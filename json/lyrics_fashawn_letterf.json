Because in the next few fragments, the letter F will be featured. Listen now to the letter F\n\n[Intro]\nI'd like to introduce myself\nI be the, your majesty\nThe Tsar\nMaster of the ceremony\nMaster of any occasion\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhat would the alphabet be without the F?\nOr the G when the the letters are supreme\nI grew up the be the father of my cypher of MCs\nMy sons and daughters needed diapers\nI plant seed all across the atlas\nAs far as these rap kids, baby paw was active\nLeft a lot of ink on a lot of sheets\nGave birth to a new me every few weeks\nWhy? Everybody wanna be the F\nPlease, just be yourself, that's what I suggest\nJesus Christ the young buck's nice when I clutch mics\nSet fire to niggas like stuffed pipes\nThe rugged and rough type\nStrutting and scuffed Nikes\nGutter but I always had a lust for the lush life\nI turn iron to gold like an alchemist\nNigga there's only one F in the alphabet\n\n[Sample]\n\n[Hook]\nIt be the F-A crooked letter\nWho you know do it better\nYou ain't gotta spell the rest\nJust call me the letter F\nOnce again\nIt be the F-A crooked letter\nWho you know do it better\nYou ain't gotta spell the rest\nJust call me the letter F\n\n[Verse 2]\nAs if it be any better than the sixth letter\nWhen will he slip? Never\nWho mislead 'em Huh?\nTwist letters\nPassing spliffs with my big bredren\nHigh enough to kiss the heavens\nStick figure, dick bigger than Nick's cannon\nPlenty chickens I did damage, the kids manage\nT o blow up despite\nThe fact  had to grow up in the home of the three strikes\nWhere no one succeeds\nIt's like I was one out of a hundred\nMotherfuckers who had got just what in wanted in life\nI had the hunger\nTo be unstoppable, conquer every obstacle\nAccomplish the impossible\nPartner I got a lot to lose\nToo much love, too much pride\nWay too much pressure for just one guy\nSoul of the west, behold it's the best\nMaster of the ceremony better known as the F\nIt's like that and uh\n\n[Sample] + [Hook]", "title": "Letter F"}]}
