Fuck my advice, live your life\nStop tripping like everything amount to crisis\nI make the sacrifices, my history is black as ice is\nI don't think that I can trust you if you're lacking vices\nI never miss a beat, the liquor make me slurred, it takes my words\nTries to twist them like a Swisher Sweet with sticky herbs\nAmerican History X, your teeth'll hit the curb\nIt's easy 'cause I'm ill with the wordplay, I still flip the bird\nLike Jeezy, strip it down, now it's exposed\nI suppose my flow is the emperor's new clothes\nAlthough I'm always by myself, I never ride alone\nThe music is on then I'm right at home, zoning\nListening to instrumentals\nThinking about all the things I've been through\nThe music is just a peek into my life, it's a window\nIt's so high tech and it's all so simple\nAnd if I'm knocked down, I don't stay down\nEven if I get down, I don't lay down\nHotter than the tar on this empty playground\nHotter than the tar on this empty playground\nYeah, it's pavement\nDon't be scared to think, man, don't be scared\nI know whats in your brain\nIt's scary, man, you only usin' like ten percent\nThe other ninety percent is scary, man\nBut don't be scared, scary ass niggas"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
