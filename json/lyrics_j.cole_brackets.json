Yup. Hey, I told you that check was coming in, I gotchu when it came in. Goddamn, I'm a man of my word. Goddamn, I told you I'ma have it, and goddamn, I'ma have it for you. Hell, shit, damn right. Now, how much was it though? Uh huh. Huh? Half? Half nigga? You crazy, boy, you crazy. Bitch, you crazy as fuck. Bitch, bitch, you better suck half my dick!\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, I pay taxes, so much taxes, shit don't make sense\nWhere do my dollars go? You see lately, I ain't been convinced\nI guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools\nBut my niggas barely graduate, they ain't got the tools\nMaybe 'cause the tax dollars that I make sure I send\nGet spent hirin' some teachers that don't look like them\nAnd the curriculum be tricking them, them dollars I spend\nGot us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin\nOne thing about the men that's controlling the pen\nThat write history, they always seem to white-out they sins\nMaybe we'll never see a black man in the White House again\nI'll write a check to the IRS, my pockets get slim\nDamn, do I even have a say 'bout where it's goin'?\nSome older nigga told me to start votin'\nI said \"Democracy is too fuckin' slow\"\nIf I'm givin' y'all this hard-earned bread, I wanna know\nBetter yet, let me decide, bitch, it's 2018\nLet me pick the things I'm funding from an app on my screen\nBetter that than letting wack congressman I've never seen\nDictate where my money go, straight into the palms of some Money-hungry company that make guns that circulate the country And then wind up in my hood, making bloody clothes\nStray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose\nFrom the concrete, he was prolly rose\nNow his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother\nHe did good at the white man schools unlike his brother\nWho was lost in the streets all day, not using rubbers\nSo right now, he got two on the way\nStill sleep on covers in his mama house\nShe can't take this shit no more, she want him out\nOn the morning of the funeral, just as she's walking out\nWiping tears away, grabbing her keys and sunglasses\nShe remember that she gotta file her taxes, damn\n\n[Chorus]\n(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\n(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\n(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\n(Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"}], "artist": "J.
