I got my problems to face\nCause it pours when it rains out in Washington state\nBehind a hexagonal shaped gate, you can't even relate\nRight now I live inside a base\nInside the beast, watch how I move and speak\nThere's military police on every street\nLife is shit, I taste it in the food I eat\nMotherfuckers be amazed by how cool I keep\nI don't get depressed, I get the vest\nYou still don't recognize the voice, you got 20 seconds left\nDawg, my team is small, but you can still look\nTo the left of your head and see a red beam on the wall\nFirepower so awesome, when the barrel is barkin\nI lean forward to keep from fallin\nMy gun's got grenade launchers on the bottom\nKeep talkin, you'll be restin as pieces in a coffin"}]}
