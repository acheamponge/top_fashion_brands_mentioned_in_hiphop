Lo\nWhen I walk up in the spot everybody excited\nYoung winners gonna run the world and your chick gon' like it\nYeah fuck with a dreamer where the grass way greener\nLet loose, take it easy\nI know the life that you live make you meaner\nIt ain't about it, you deserve it\nBut if your actions are worth it\nYou ever did it all night when I turn off the lights\nGirl them actions are perfect\nIt's something bout me though\nI shine hard in the night time\nThey judge me for my flaws\nBut know nothing bout what's inside\nYou wanted to learn about me though\nYou could probably search on a website\nShe know that I be watching her\nI was popular in my other life\nI see what a name get you\nTake the focus off the main picture\nThey tried to box me in\nSo [?] switching\nMeet me on the moon, I'm in a spaceship Coop\nBeen scratching at the surface tryna make shit through\nYour best friend [?]\nYour mind ain't right if you ain't fucking with the crew\n\n[Hook]\nBefore you speak on me, look at the mirror on the wall\nIf it was up to me we'd already know who we are\nYou wasn't here for me but I still answer when you call\nBefore you speak on me, look at the mirror on the wall\nThe mirror on the wall\nIf it was up to me we'd already know who we are\nYou wasn't here for me but I still answer when you call\nSo before you speak on me, look at the mirror on the wall\n\n[Bridge]\nYeah, it's the mirror on the wall\nPeople see me out and they show love and keep it going\nAnd I wonder if it's real\nI can't trust and I don't know 'em\nThe truth lies beyond, everybody's scared to show it\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey telling me the cash is, I'm snatching that\nI just spit them life rhymes and let them hoes imagine that\nShe seen me at the show, said she love how I'm so passionate\nYou got that kind of swagger shit\nYou the type of nigga I'd let you hit\n[?] the pussy down and stay legit\nYou remind me of the mirror on the wall\nLook at me as the king of that\nAnd tell me who the fliest young nigga of 'em all\nDiamonds in my ear\nAnd baby my future like a crystal ball\nSwitching stereotypes up\nCause I always been against the odds\nI got faith in the mirror on the wall\nGot a whip in my garage and my mind is a god\nAnd it grow to the sky so I know I'm too fly\nDon't lose hope, don't stop trying\nClose that door, girl we vibing\n\n[Hook]\nBefore you speak on me, look at the mirror on the wall\nIf it was up to me we'd already know who we are\nYou wasn't here for me but I still answer when you call\nBefore you speak on me, look at the mirror on the wall\nThe mirror on the wall\nIf it was up to me we'd already know who we are\nYou wasn't here for me but I still answer when you call\nSo before you speak on me, look at the mirror on the wall"}]}
