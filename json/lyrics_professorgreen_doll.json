This new attitude\nIs probably gonna leave a lot of people mad at me\nIt'll have to be, I'll be glad to see some anarchy\nIt wasn't the money that changed me it was the lack of sleep\nTo get to sleep I need more than a bag of weed\nWhat happened last year? I can't even remember back a week\nIt just became a blur, don't believe everything you've heard\nAlthough I heard Peter Burns just became a her\nAll these people sucking me and telling me that I'm the shit\nAin't any less annoying than those who told me that I should quit\nFeel like saying fuck it on a whim, chucking it all in\nI ain't some fucking puppet on a string\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge]\nI came into this polite, and well mannered\nYou know I've always believed that you should learn to tolerate things\nCause the world's full of them\nI seem to have misplaced my patience\nThere's how many of you and there's only one of me\nI can't keep everyone happy\n\n[Hook x2]", "year": null}]}
