I said let's slow it down\nOnly now do I realize that it's over\nCalling like a crazy ex, I need to stop, wait a sec\nGive her room to breathe. five feet. please, baby\nIs it my ego? tell me, people, cause I ain't sure\nIs it cause she broke my heart before I got to break hers\nI'm a selfish man wanting what I can't have\nWe had a ball, but I gotta have the last dance\nI just stay cool, trying for us to coexist\nSaying this song ain't about you, but you know it is\nI'm not trying to be rude, I'm doing what I'm supposed to do\nHope these sunny days, giving me thoughts of you\nAll I know, baby All I know\nYou're the one I love, the only one I love"}]}
