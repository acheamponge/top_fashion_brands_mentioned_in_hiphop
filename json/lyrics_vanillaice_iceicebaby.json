Shay plays on the fade\nSlice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade\nSo fast, other DJs say \u201cDamn!\u201d\nIf my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram\nKeep my composure when it's time to get loose\nMagnetized by the mic while I kick my juice\nIf there was a problem yo I'll solve it\nCheck out the hook while D-Shay revolves it\n\n[Hook]\nIce ice baby Vanilla\nIce ice baby Vanilla\nIce ice baby Vanilla\nIce ice baby Vanilla\n\n[Outro]\nYo man, let's get out of here\nWord to your mother\n\nIce ice baby, too cold\nIce ice baby, too cold too cold\nIce ice baby, too cold too cold\nIce ice baby, too cold too cold", "album": "Hooked", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ac4635d774c4d36866e0d188b1f318d1.600x589x1.jpg"}]}
