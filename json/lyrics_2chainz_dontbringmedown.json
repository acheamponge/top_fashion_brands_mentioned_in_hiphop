Trigger squeez!\nAnd please...if being broke is a disease, I took a test amd passed then nigga I'm clean\nFrom methazine poured in a two-litre\nGot my gorillas with me and I'm the zoo keeper\nSee you ain't seen it all until you seen it all\nIf life a like a movie, you never know when it night pause\nPause. Uh\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "2 Chainz"}
