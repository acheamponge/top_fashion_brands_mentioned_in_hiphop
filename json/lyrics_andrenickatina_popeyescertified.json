D. P\nYo homie it's after eight\nWe goin down to the Lions Gate\nThat's the restaurant with the free Henn when you buy a steak\nI'm like an earthquake\nShakin up the foundation\nFigured out the combination\nTo your iphone application\nI got the recipe the menu is the rest of me\nMy car does match my Jordan's and some say that was fresh of me\nI'm like The Loch Ness sittin up in a dropped 'Vette\nHangin like a chain that you might see up on 'Pacs neck\nI'm like the last poem\nTell them suckas go on home\nHow much yo is that cologne\nI got it goin on\nI'm like a new Glock holdin down an old block\nAnd even though it's crack rock they protect it like it's Fort Knox\nWe eattin pork chops with a real Muslim aura\nWe hit Hawaii like it's Pearl Harbor\nTora! Tora!\nI might say neyamora\nOr homie what's the score-a\nAnd you can ask for what you want but I got nothing for ya"}]}
