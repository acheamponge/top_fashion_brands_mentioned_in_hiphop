Bozzie what's happenin'?\nHello? Look\nWhat you do? Ride for my brothers dawg\nHey, look\nSummer 16\nLook, look, it's what we at, look\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm at the tee like Jordan Spieth, I'm the chosen one\nCause every road block I see I find a hole in one\nI'm on the green but the bunker's a possibility\nHumbled through my success and all these impostors is feeling me\nIt's no surprise cause I execute with the best of 'em\nMy x-and-o's is breaking down all my foes\nI always kill 'em softly and leave them a little exposed\nNow you probably see my pic by the definition of goals look\nMy mind's spacin' the future y'all my-space\nI get my car pooled it's gonna be when I buy ace\nThis my pace, I'm slow motion, better than no motion\nI'm in the fast-lane and I'm servin' 'em when I'm coastin' look\nThis easy work y'all better listen work for money made\nHeavy duty I handle these changes feather weight\n23 on my back the way that I elevate\nI turned it up and they hate it, them problems escalate\nI go in my bag of tricks and get the hit and licks\nThat mean I'm takin' what I want ignore the consequence\nMy prominence stem from the dominance of a kid that was overlooked but he grew up an optimist\nThey feel like them gives a hit of fame when they come to game\nGot the grill and the chain lookin' like a lame\nThese dudes followin' for size that they can't sustain\nI'm savin' for a rainy day while they make it rain\nUh, so shout out to my followers I'm disappointed\nThey make a couple dollars now they feel anointed\nWe the guys you know the saying you can't beat 'em join it\nWe come from where them trigger fingers is double jointed\nWhen that pressure on me heavy, just beware I'm deadly\nAnd my back against the wall, I probably break the levee\nA man of God, I'm risin' above the odds\nHow many in my position can say the same for the squad\nThat legendary hereditary when it come to me\nI'm tied to the tribe Felix Mitchell, Huey P\nThat deep, East-Oakland breed, that elite focus\nI'm breakin' bread with all real ones if you see me toast Dolla", "year": "2016-07-04"}], "artist": "Dame D.O.L.L.A."}
