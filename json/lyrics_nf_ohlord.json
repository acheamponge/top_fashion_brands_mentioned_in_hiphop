Oh Lord?\"\n\"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord)? Oh Lord?\"\n\"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?\"\n\"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nListen! Yeah, everybody wants change\nDon't nobody wanna change though\nDon't nobody wanna pray\n'Til they got something to pray for\nKnow everybody's gon' die\nBut don't everybody live though\nSometimes I look up to the sky\nAnd wonder\u2026\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord)? Oh Lord?\"\n\"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord)? Oh Lord?\"\n\"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?\"\n\"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's easy to blame God, but harder to fix things\nWe look in the sky like, \"Why ain't you listening?\"\nWatchin' the news in our livin' rooms on the big screens\nAnd talking 'bout, \"If God's really real, then where is he?\"\nYou see the same God that we're sayin' might not even exist\nBecomes real to us, but only when we're dyin' in bed\nWhen you're healthy, it's like, we don't really care for Him then\nLeave me alone God, I'll call you when I need you again\nWhich is funny, everyone will sleep in the pews\nThen blame God for our problems like he's sleeping on you\nWe turn our backs on him, what do you expect him to do?\nIt's hard to answer prayers when nobody's prayin' to you\nI look around at this world we walk on\nIt's a smack in the face, don't ever tell me there's no God\nAnd if there isn't then what are we here for?\nAnd what are y'all doing down there? I don't know, Lord\n\n[Chorus]\n\"(Do you see us? Oh Lord)? Oh Lord?\"\n\"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord)? Oh Lord?\"\n\"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?\"\n\"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?\"\n\n[Outro]\nDo you see us down here, oh Lord?\nCan you see us down here, oh Lord?\nOh Lord, oh Lord\nCan you see us?\nCan't you see us?"}], "artist": "NF"}
