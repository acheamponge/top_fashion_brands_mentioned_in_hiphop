Future for a black male\nDon't want to make my momma cry\nOn a front page for a homicide\nFly whips, all I wanted to drive\nWhere chicks get blunted and ride\nDo 105 in the fast lane\nAnd a fast pace, chasin' the papes\nSpendin' chips on big chains\nAnd the dimes that give brains\nThat was a 80's and 90's thing\nNow I'm into big things\n\n[Chorus]\nNah, I ain't fuckin' with you\nNow I'm into big things\nGotta get my life together man\n'Cause now I'm into big things\nNah, I ain't gon' ride with you\n'Cause now I'm into big things\nNah, I can't do that shit no more\nNow I'm into big things\nNah, I can't fuck with you\nI'm into big things\nNah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners\nI'm into big things\nTired of talkin' small talk\nI'm into big things\nI'm into big things\nThe big things\nThe big things\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I started this\nAll I wanted was cars and cribs\nLike other rap artists but\nDo I know where I'm goin' to?\nCan I forget when I came from?\nI be showin' you\nAnother style I'ma flow for you\nCan I make somethin' wild\nI can throw for you, flow for you\nMake it bi-coastal\nTake it to heights\nThat some of y'all can't come close to?\nSome of y'all\nWant to talk like hoes\nWorse than bitches\nAnd when y'all niggas see me blow\nBet it hurt like stitches\nNo competition\nI stop and twist 'em\nHit 'em like a mafia proposition\nI rap and y'all stop and listen\nThinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in\nLook up at a nigga, now\nRocks that glisten\nCan't stop my mission\nMake another LP drop\nI'm hittin' with the new shit, exclusive\nNo time to get caught up in a crime\nI ain't have shit to do with\nUsed to chase the hoes\nNow I chase the dough\nIs y'all bitches gonna help me get paper?\nNo!\n\n[Chorus]\nNah, I ain't fuckin' with you\nNow I'm into big things (ill)\nGotta get my life together man (uh huh)\n'Cause now I'm into big things (big things)\nNah, I ain't gon' ride with you (nah not no more)\n'Cause now I'm into big things (fuck y'all)\nYou know I can't do that shit no more (why?)\nNow I'm into big things\nNah, I can't fuck with you (why?)\nI'm into big things\nNah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners (why's that?)\nI'm into big things (uh)\nTired of talkin' small talk\nI'm into big things\nI'm into big things\nThe big things\nThe big things\n\n[Verse 3]\nI go past y'all (UH-HUH)\nY'all got the glass jaw (UH-HUH)\nAnd when I hit it, admit it\nY'all on ya ass y'all (UH-HUH)\nWe on the same team\nYou don't wanna pass the ball\nChuck and gunnin' for dough\nYou want to score\nBut you really don't know how to to ball\nI put you on\nIt was me that introduced you to wealth\nCrossin' me is like shootin' yourself\nWanna blow so fast, now do it yourself\nYou ain't shit now\nYou was so ill, why you never came out?\nWhere ya clique now?\nWhere you sit now? In the back seat\nMad 'cause I flip styles and I pack heat\nMake you run laps like a pro athlete\nAnd I done that\nFrom my experiences\nI appear relentless\nTake more time\nJust to hear my sentence\nI'ma tell you what's real\nAnd what could stop you from makin a mil'\nYou could prevent this\nWhen niggas don't see eye to eye to you\nLie to you\nWanna get high with you\nWant to eat food off of your labor\nAnd take food off your table\n'Cause they don't see your vision\nDon't understand your mission\nIs to make history\nWhile you here\nHow long you plan on livin'?\nNot for forever\nAt least to 140\nPray for me, I'm tryin' to eat\nLike the niggas who bought\nMotown off Berry Gordy\nGood God\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga I'm tired of games\nI'm into big things\nGotta get my life together man\n'Cause now I'm into big things\nTired of talkin' small talk\n'Cause now I'm into big things\nI'm into big things\nThe big things\nThe big things\nMan we already did that\nNow I'm into big things\nNo time to get sidetracked\nNow I'm into big things\nGet money now besides that\nSome more big things\nI'm into big things\nThe big things\nThe big things"}], "artist": "Nas"}
