I still break legs at the shins\nStill slapping off them silly grins\nI still fill up the stash sheet, clap at your cold feet\nGive your girl full skeet while you're holding short meat\nWant to throw shots? Say when\nAnd get tossed of the roof and scraped off the pavement\nAnd when I strike, you may not like\nSo get your squad ready and prepare for a fight\nWhen I strike\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy diamond in the rough is now flawless\nShe done came through with the flying colors\nShe's my main girl, she's the right girl\nIn this hip-hop world, she's my hype girl\nShe don't understand it, the ins and outs\nBut that's not what wifey is all about\nShe shows support for the things I do\nI be the one, and she's a lot more than the two\nBut niggas still want to take what she got\nSo I hit them with the hot Glock, cook them like a Crock Pot\nHit them in the snot spot, watch the bullshit stop\nI change things I do not like\nSo when I step left, you better step right\nAnd get your squad ready and prepare for a fight\nWhen I strike\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro 4x: Scratches by DJ Premier]\n\"I keep you on the run\""}], "artist": "Big Shug"}
