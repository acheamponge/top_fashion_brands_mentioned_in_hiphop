{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Intro: Woman #1 and Ice Cube]\nIce Cube, do you think you could give me some money to get my hair done?\nWhat's wrong with your hair right now?\nWell you know I get it done every week, and I need my nails done too\nLook, I'mma tell you like this\n\n[Verse 1: Ice Cube]\nI ain't the one, the one to get played like a pooh butt\nSee I'm from the street, so I know what's up\nOn these silly games that's played by the women\nI'm only happy when I'm goin up in em\nBut you know, I'm a menace to society\nBut girls in biker shorts are so fly to me\nSo I step to 'em, with aggression\nListen to the kid, and learn a lesson today\nSee, they think we narrow minded\n'Cause they got a cute face, and big-behinded\nSo I walk over and say \"How ya doin'?\"\nSee, I'm only down for screwin', but you know\nYa gotta play it off cool\n'Cause if they catch you slipping, you'll get schooled\nAnd they'll get you for your money, son\nNext thing you know you're getting their hair and they nails done\nFool, and they'll let you show em off\nBut when it comes to sex, they got a bad cough\nOr a headache, it's all give\nAnd no take\nRun out of money, and watch your heart break\nThey'll drop you like a bad habit\n'Cause a brother with money yo, they gotta have it\nMessing with me though, they gets none\nYou can't juice Ice Cube, girl, 'cause I ain't the one\n\n[Interlude #1: Woman #2 and Woman #1]\nGirrrrrl, you got to get these brothers for all the money you can honey. 'Cause if they ain't got no money, they can't do nothin' for me but get out of my face\nI know what you mean, girl; it ain't nothin' right jumpin' off unless he got dollars!\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nSometimes I used to wonder\nHow the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number\nHe's getting juiced for his ducats\nI tell a girl in a minute yo, I drive a bucket\nAnd won't think nuttin' of it\nShe can ride or walk, either leave it or love it\nI show her that I'm not the O, the N-E, say\nI'm a ruthless N-I double-G A\n'Cause I'm gamin' on a female that's gamin' on me\nYou know I spell girl with a B\nA brother like me is only out for one thing\nI think with my ding-a-ling, but I won't bring no\nFlowers to your doorstep, when we goin out\n'Cause you'll take it for granted, no doubt\nAnd after the date, I'mma want to do the wild thing\nYou want lobster, huh? I'm thinking Burger King\nAnd when I take you, you get frustrated\nYou can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it\nBut you see, I don't go nuts\nOver girls like you with the BIG ol butts\nIt start comin' out the pocket, to knock it\nBut when the damage is done\nYou can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl\nFor the simple fact that, I ain't the one\n\n[Interlude #2: Woman #2 and Woman #1]\nI don't care how they look; if they got money, we can hook up but they ain't gettin' none\nYeah, I just make em think they gonna get some, play with they mind a lil bit, and get that money. Oh Ice Cube, can I have some money pleeeease?\n\n[Verse 3]\nGive you money? Why bother?\n'Cause you know I'm looking nothing like your father\nGirl, I can't be played or ganked\nGanked means getting took for your bank\nOr your gold or your money or something\nNine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing\nThey get mad when I put it in perspective\nBut let's see if my knowledge is effective\nTo the brothas man they robbing you blind\n'Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind\nKeep your money to yourself, homie\nAnd if you got enough game\nYou'll get her name and her number\nWithout going under\nYou can't leave 'em and love and stay above 'em\nI used to get no play; now she stay behind me\n'Cause I said I had a Benz 190\nBut I lied and played the one\nJust to get some; now she feels dumb\nTo my homies it's funny\nBut that's what you get trying to play me for my money\nNow don't you feel used?\nBut I don't give a hoot, huh, because I knock boots\nYou shouldn't be, so damn material\nAnd try to milk Ice Cube like cereal\nNow how many times do I have to say it?\n'Cause if I have to go get a gun\nYou girls will learn I don't burn\nYou think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one\n\n[Outro: Woman #1 and Ice Cube]\nBut you said you love me!\nI don't see no rings on this finger\nWhy you doin' me like this? I love you!\nYeah, you love my money; I got what I wanted -- beat it!", "album": "Straight Outta Compton", "year": "1988-08-08", "title": "I Ain\u2019t tha 1", "image": "https://images.genius.com/97fb57d9845448d4161069957e53762c.500x490x1.jpg"}], "artist": "N.W.A"}
