We won't let you escape\"\nSo I said \"Okay, I guess I'll just wait\"\nSend me a postcard from the city of Rome\nTell me all the pretty things about the girls that you know\nBuy me a bottle of wine and send it on air mail express\nI'll drink it all alone inside my home by the lake in this mess\nI'll send a, a thank you for not leaving in the night\nAt least saying goodbye and let me have my dignity right\nI know I'm just a little sad bastard making a mess\nOf this stupid little story that's dancin' in my head\n\nBut when I wake inside my bed and you're gone\nI got nothin' better to do than stand outside\nAnd wave to the geese flying over my front lawn\nSo I eat, sleep, drink and count the walls and tiles\nAnd then I'll sit here and maybe try to crack a smile\nBut every day I sit and think of what you're doing right now\nMy friends and family skipped town - left me all alone in this crowd\nAnd I know I'm just a sad excuse for... whatever - who cares\nBut bottom line is it's just a dream and I wake up right here\nNext to you, next to your face and inside my bed\nIn my home in Jacksonville where no one's going anywhere\nI still don't got a passport or a ticket of this ride\nBut fuckin' A, I'll stick around for the rest of my life\n\nWhen I'm riding 'round the globe\nAnd I'm doing this and I'm signin' that\nAnd I'm trying\nAnd I'm trying", "year": null}]}
