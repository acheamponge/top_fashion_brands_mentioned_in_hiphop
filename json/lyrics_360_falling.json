Are you starting to fall?\nListen, I ain't saying that I love you\nAnd I ain't worrying at all if you don't love me\nBut I ain't saying I don't trust you\nIt's just that where I'm at in my life, yo, I don't trust me\nYeah, I'm unsteady, wasn't ready for this right now\nI feel heavy, I'm stressing, ain't ready to be tied down\nLike G said, I might be overanalysing\nBut I'm so over analysing\n\n[Chorus 2: James Blake (Sampled)]\nI don't know about my dreams\nI don't know about my dreaming anymore\nAll that I know is\nI'm falling, falling, falling, falling\nFalling\nI don't know about my love\nI don't know about my loving anymore\nAll that I know is\nI'm falling, falling, falling, falling\nMight as well fall in\nI don't know about my dreams\nI don't know about my dreaming anymore\nAll that I know is\nI'm falling, falling, falling, falling\n[?]\nI don't know about my dreams\nI don't know about my dreaming anymore\nAll that I know is\nI'm falling, falling, falling, falling\nMight as well fall in"}]}
