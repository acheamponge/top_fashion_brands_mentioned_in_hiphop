I call that maturity\nLearnin how to fall back so you can live in purity\nLearnin how to walk that and saying you ain't luring me\nThe media is feeding us with lies but He's curing me (be easy)\nI know guys trying to hype you\nBut cling to the Lord's Word, flee from them vipers\nWe spitting aiming at your heart like snipers\nWe'd like for you to desire God like Piper"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
