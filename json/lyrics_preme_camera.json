It hurts, don't it?\nI know it do\nMy homies said I'll find a better woman\nI told them slim chance\nBut I hope it's true\nShe told me I took advantage\nAnd that I took her for granted\nWell if time heals all wounds\nI hope [?] brought a bigger bandage\nYeah, if I could cry\nI wouldn't wipe a tear\nIt's hard saying what you need to hear\nBut if you ever make my little man call another dad, i'll do 25 to life and won't regret a year\nGuess just Us wasn't the plan for Us\nBut don\u2019t say I wasn't man enough\nHustling hard, balling through the mall, they couldn't handle us\nNow the only thing we got left is on your camera\n\nYeah, and I don't mean to make things worse\nI\u2019d be lying if I said it didn't hurt\nBut if all good things must end\nThen this is goodbye my friend\nThey couldn't handle us\n(Now the only thing we got left is on your camera)\nThey couldn't handle us\n(Now the only thing we got left is on your camera)\n\nYeah, I fell in love the minute I met you\nThinkin' god must really have blessed you\nRight from the beginning I started to stress you\nCause you said you had a man and I shouldn't accept you\nI said \u201cnah, I don't need anybody except you\u201d\nAnd I\u2019ll do anything but regret you\nThat I would do everything to protect you\n8 years later you say I neglect you\nI wanted the world, you wanted your man\nYou tried to walk with a smile\nBut it's hard to pretend, all your childish ways made you hard to defend\nPlus the shit you put on Twitter, the start of the end\nDamn, where the fuck did we go wrong?\nWhy the fuck we ain't hold on?\nAt the start I said you so bad\nNow it\u2019s the end baby, so long\nLast words, \u201cI\u2019m really hoping you [?]\u201d\nYou said, \u201cI hope you find the girl you\u2019re looking for and I swear it\u201d\nI write with a broken heart and it shatters in every lyrics\nBeen trying hard to conceal it, but breakups will break your spirit\n\nYeah, and I don't mean to make things worse\nI\u2019d be lying if I said it didn't hurt\nBut if all good things must end\nThen this is goodbye my friend\nThey couldn't handle us\n(Now the only thing we got left is on your camera)\nThey couldn't handle us\n(Now the only thing we got left is on your camera)\n\nYeah, and I don't mean to make things worse\nI\u2019d be lying if I said it didn't hurt\nBut if all good things must end\nThen this is goodbye my friend\nThey couldn't handle us\n(Now the only thing we got left is on your camera)\nThey couldn't handle us\n(Now the only thing we got left is on your camera)\n\nYou know what? Fuck it\nHow could I play you?\nI made you\nThreatening to leave the one that saved you\nI'm your dream that came true\nKnow what? Its cool\nYou always talk more than you listen\nBesides, I bet a badder bitch'll be down to play your position\nWho are you to judge?\nWho made you the shit?\nWho are you to quit?\nThought you was too legit?\nOnly two words come to mind\nFuckin' bitch\nIf that wasn't love\nIt don't exist", "year": null}]}
