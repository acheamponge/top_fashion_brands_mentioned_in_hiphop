(x2)\n\nNever seen an ass so round\nPretty brown hair to the ground\nMake a young pimpin' say his vows\nMet a girl in k town\nSool, soju\nTwo hands, old school\nNever had a girl so down\nMet a girl in K-Town\n\nV1:\nYou only spoke a little bit of English\nBut your shoe game was the meanest\nA star cause you fresh outta FIDM\nAnd you ain't fuckin' with no nigga in a Civic\nYour daddy never really like dark folk\nBut you don't know your daughter like I know\nSaid she made enough to pay the car note\nAnd a condo, somewhere on Serrano\n\nREFRAIN:\nHa-ha\nAh\nWhat could i do wit a K-Town girl? (x2)\n\nNever seen an ass so round\nPretty brown hair to the ground\nMake a young pimpin' say his vows\nMet a girl in k town\nSool, soju\nTwo hands, old school\nNever had a girl so down\nFuck around in K-Town\n\n(Random audio clip of Korean girls laughing)\n\nV2 (Dumbfoundead):\nThree models surrounded by green bottles\nGreen bottles with labels of dream models\nSecond round going down, please follow\nAfter hours karaoke and end with king taco\nOops\nI mean El Taurino\nRosy cheeks looking redder than the sauce, Pinche Chino\nA couple hours ago we were dancing up in VR\nBooking girls to the table when I met a sweetheart\nShe told me that I wasn't like them other assholes\nShe got hit on by 20 dudes at Belasco\nKing of K-Town, roll to my castle\nThree dollar cabs, no hassle\n\nREFRAIN:\nHa-ha\nAh\nWhat could i do wit a K-Town girl? (x2)\n\nNever seen an ass so round\nPretty brown hair to the ground\nMake a young pimpin' say his vows\nMet a girl in k town\nSool, soju\nTwo hands, old school\nNever had a girl so down\nFuck around in K-Town"}]}
