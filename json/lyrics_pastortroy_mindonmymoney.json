Ho\nThen I'm back sinking banks\nWhile slitting Swishers\nLights, cameras, action\nWhy bitches be snapping pictures\nWish ya had the lout\nWish ya had the money\nWish ya had that big body Benz filled with hundreds\nIt's funny\nCause niggas think just cause we got stacks\nBut when I was broke bitches still rode on my lap\nPerhaps\nThe money that's earned the game that's learned\nThem hoe's that yearn\nMake them pussy niggas eat yo worm\nBut here's your turn\nShit go ahead bust shots at me\nCause fucking hoe's and making money the priority\n\nHook:\n\nI got my mind on my money\nI ain't studdin' these hoe's (Repeat 2x)\nI ain't studdin' these hoe's 2x\n\nVerse 2: Pastor Troy\n\nA bunch of bitches don't bring no glory\nShit all they bring is a fucking bunch of lies and stories\nAnd yeah I got a stack of stories standing weed high\nAnd you can't take 'em with you when a nigga has to die\nSo I say fuck her\nBitches I try my best to duck em\nI'm on the run\nAll these jealous motherfucking niggas\nIs packing guns\nFor fun they wanna take the air\nThe Pastor breathe\nBut the shit does not give me a scare\nThey best believe\nWith ease I want to leave this Earth\nBut I'ma let these muthafuckers try to kill me first\nLet's keep it interesting\nThe topics I be mentioning\nHell and heaven walking streets with that Mack 11\nShot 'em with 7\nPop them niggas pick my shells up\nAnd run and kick 'em\nTell them niggas we don't give a fuck\nAnd fuck who with 'em\nEquitted so see me smiling to a round of applause\nShot a bird at the judge\nTell 'em fuck they laws\nMy ball is hard as bricks\nSo I be damned if he charge me with shit\nI'm sick as O.J\nAnd gonna make these hoe's day\nIt's understood\nPastor Troy up out this muthafucker with the money and the goods\n\nHook:  4x\n\nI got my mind on my money\nI ain't studdin' these hoe's (Repeat 2x)\nI ain't studdin' these hoe's 2x", "year": null}]}
