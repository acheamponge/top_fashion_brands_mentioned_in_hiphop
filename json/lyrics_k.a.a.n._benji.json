fallin' pick me up\nIf I'm fallin' pick me up\nIf I'm fallin' pick me up\nAlright\n\n[Hook]\nFear of falling\nFeeling like I'm never gonna make it (make it)\nFeeling like I got this rap shit in my grasp\nBut I can not grab or take it\nGravitating\nTowards falling\nAnd I fear that whenever I'm trying\nI feel like my sanity is in my face but I can not grab or find it\nStop!\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow pay attention when a motherfucker spitting\nOn a track not lax I should get paid\nNigga, shit my brain sharper than a switchblade\nBecause I don't flow, I just cascade\nAnd every other motherfucker that you listen to\nDon't stay true, that's a motherfucking masquerade\nBut who am I to judge cause they're in it for the money\nI'm a hundred miles and running I'm automatically gunning down\nAnyone that wanted this real\nI'm never fronting, novocaine for your brain\nMy rhymes are mind numbing nigga\nWriting that shit that you can't supersede\nI give a fuck about what you believe\nAnd I could care less about how I'm perceived\nSo just open your mind so that you can receive\nAll these blessings I'm giving whenever I preach\nFrom my pulpit\nI don't bullshit\nMy nigga don't trip\nGet hit quick\nThen get a grip bitch\nI spit a full clip\nSo when you hear the click from this deliverer\nThey say my style is so motherfucking sinister\nYou need to get in contact with your minister\nI keep my flow on lock like a prisoner\nCheck the forensics of what I have prepped for ya\nThe suspension of all your expenditures\nNow if you let me take it up another motherfucking notch\nI'ma spit it till it pop\nBlood drips then it drops\nAnd I bet you niggas watching from the sideline\nThey got the lights on homie like it's primetime\nBut am I ready for it, nigga I will never really know\nUntil I step up on the stage and then I let my lyrics flow\nFrom a place of desperation, a balance of segregation\nI'm leaving you salivating from lyrical elevation\nAnd I hope the game ready 'cause this ain't a simulation\nAssimilated the facts of rap that's on board\nAnd stimulating the minds of my demographics abhorred\nThat your flow is so forced it's not consensual coitous\nYou niggas can't avoid this\nYou couldn't break change to make cents, four quarters\nSo when you step be cautious\nCause my mind lawless, and at this point in time I'm accustomed the losses\nChi-Town '84, he ballin'\nFoot up on the gas but the car keeps stalling\nGot fame from the game whose main dame is flawed\nAnd while scuffin' up the hardwood floors till the mornin'\nA moment of silence, atonement of violence\nBut this the last time I'ma try to make it private\nI put it on consignment\nAnd give it an assignment\nI hope that the days alignin' 'cause I'm really tired of dealing with the\u2013\n\n[Hook]\nFear of falling\nFeeling like I'm never gonna make it (make it)\nFeeling like I got this rap shit in my grasp\nBut I can not grab or take it\nGravitating\nTowards falling\nAnd I fear that whenever I'm trying\nI feel like my sanity is in my face but I can not grab or find it\nStop!\n\n[Verse 2]\nI ain't perfect in the motherfucking least\nBut I bet I been, will transform to a beast\nLand buyers wasn't biased to the shit a nigga seen\nEscobar turned to the slum into fucking Medell\u00edn\nNigga fuck you and your compliments\nCause all you give is false confidence\nI check the contents of your context\nThat shit's nonsense, that's full of discontent\nBut I'ma bout to vent to get it off my chest\nJust like a bench press\nAnd if you feel impressed\nThen you should write a check so that you can invest\nI need advancement money plus interest\nCause my flow's disgusting like incest\nI said I burn it up just like incense\nAnd if it's all about a dollar\nThat's a motherfucking problem\nCause I care for more than just dividends\nThat you could divvy up\nUntil the prize dries\nThey got they hands out\nThey got they eyes wide\nI told 'em bring it in they call it high tide\nThey all washed up like they tide dry\nMy flow complicated never concentrated\nIt was confiscated by the constellations\nThat was ovulating from the consummation\nAnd that conversation was the confirmation\nI'm attacking the track and I do that with ease\nStomp on the beat and I'm making it bleed\nWhere internally surgery needed I seen it\nMy style is demeaning but yet it's distinguished\nDispersed and extinguish a merce of relinquish\nThese lines I'm releasing gon' leave you in pieces\nI'm spitting a grievance that's leaving you grieving\nHope we in agreement that you'll be conceded\nContrite with the lessons that I have been giving\nI'm busting my ass like I work for commission\nBut I'm insecure so I write, re-revision\nConstructing these bars like I'm building a prison\nThe way that I give it would murder a cynic\nEmbarrass a critic, my flow is acrylic\nI'm spitting acidic\nWhile bombing your city\nAnd bombing the beat\nAnd just know that I'm feeling the\u2013\n\n[Hook]\nFear of falling\nFeeling like I'm never gonna make it\nFeeling like I got this rap shit in my grasp\nBut I can not grab or take it\nGravitating\nTowards falling\nAnd I fear that whenever I'm trying\nI feel like my sanity is in my face but I can not grab or find it\nFind it\nFind it\nFind it\nFi-..."}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
