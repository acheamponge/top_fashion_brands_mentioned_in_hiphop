D-ah up in box hot\nHow I do it when I does some shit we don't talk 'bout\nIts all in the game, your man just a lame\nI'm just tryin' to put some pressure on your 5-4 frame\nAin't a damn thang changed but the way I get the cheese\nGot 'em waitin' on they knees when I touch-down overseas\nHell yea I got the keys, but I ain't talkin' bout no bricks\nI'm talkin' upscale bed & breakfast hippin', hittin' lits\nDon't nobody talk shit, the way I talk shit\nWhen I step in, they strip, they know its big son bitch\nYou can't deny it when I'm shinin', tell them all sales are final\nThink yo' girl won't bring me mines, then yo' ass in denial\n\n[Hook:]"}], "artist": "Big K.R.I.T."}
