Like..\nJust too much goin' on\nLotta, Lotta new faces, lotta new places\nLet me, you know what, matter fact, I'mma just tell 'em like this\nLet's get into it\nCheck it\n\nSummer breezin', chiefin' on this leaf an'\nEasin' on the beat reflectin' on my sunny season\nSee I just wanted to be heard up in my region\nSo I dropped The Chronicles and gave them all a reason\nPocket distribution for the EP next\nThey couldn't find release dates with GPS\nI ain't mad, but to the fans: my bad\nI promise that it's comin' and we launchin' off the pad\nThe Source Mag call me unsigned hype\nNow everybody wanna type about my unsigned life\nI heard my voice on the radio for the first time\nThat shit reminded me of when I wrote my first rhyme\nAnd my brother brought a kid into the world\nShe was like 6 pounds and 1 ounce; a babygirl\nWish I was there to say peace to my niece\nBut I was in VA doin' a meet and greet\nEither way, man, the streets been sweet\nThey knock me off my feet when they repeat my speech\nLike shout out to the guy who showed me 5 hooks\nWaited in line just so I could sign his rhyme book\nMany flicks, many picks, many plugs, many daps, many raps, many hugs\nSee I felt like star when I opened up for Kendrick Lamar\nI was a fan since KDot, not all of you are\nAnd who would figure, that I'd be in the back with Rob Digger(?)\nDiscussin' bigger figures, comin' up quicker\nI'm progressin' and expressin' with blessin's in my possession\nJust an underdog in the presence of these legends\nAnd I don't want to talk about the pressure\nLet's just say the stresses is pushin' me to be better\nLet's just say they wanna get cheddar with go getters\nI came up then they change up like the weather\nAnd oh! There was a murder; the victim was a rapper\nSend the competition to me lyrically clapper\nMy life is like a movie and we in a better chapter\nFlip the script on 'em, got the action for these actors\nSee I'm just chasin' a frame, with my name in the hip hop Hall of Fame\nWent from unknown to the name on flames\nNot bad for my very first summer in the game"}], "artist": "Nitty Scott"}
