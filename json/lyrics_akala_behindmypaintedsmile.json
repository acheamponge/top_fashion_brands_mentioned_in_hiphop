{"songs": [{"title": "Behind My Painted Smile", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Akala]\nBehind my painted smile when all the revolutionary noise is nothing but a lost little boy\nConfused and insecure, arrogant and oversure\nAn egotistical prick so come on please praise me more\nIt's great that my music bettered you but I contemplate murder every day so don't put me on a pedestal\nPlus truly, just the vehicle the music just runs through me\nIn my better moments I could let the universe use me\n\n[Lowkey]\nBehind my smile there's generations of pain, self-hatred, ingrained miseducated my brain\nDecimated the place where my dead relations were slain\nNot just physically but mentally penetrated our veins\nWhat you got inside hasn't gotta die once it can die a lot of times, that I promise my son\nAnalyse every song that I've done - tryna fight colonialism with a colonised tongue\n\n[Hook]\nHere I stand again\nLiving in sin\nCaught up, in the dream\nBehind the painted smile\n\n[Akala Verse:2]\nBehind my painted smile is the most painful grimace\nThis mental prison I live in cause I am so conditioned\nBy my privilege, what a strange contradiction\nTo grow up brown in Britain and know that your living\nWas paid for by a carcass that resembles yours\nBorn in the heart of the empire\nYou're worth more than others just like you\nBut less then the native ones, raised by my mum but in this world I am a father's son\n\n[Lowkey]\nBehind my painted smile, a very flawed human being\nDone many things that I regret and never knew the reason\nWhat do you believe in, truth or freedom or are you deceiving?\nI don't wanna die in prostration to European's\nThey say the answer is within you and nowhere else\nUnderstand the vision man on a mission to know himself\nThis is for my co-defendants no retreat and no surrender\nYou probably think that we don't remember Ota Benga\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Akala verse:3]\nThe smile is painted on my face is tainted by a frown\nPicture in the pocket's of blood that decorate the town\nTrigger jum bullets sung and guns hum\nThen everyone that's dead was somebody's someone\n\n[Lowkey]\nBehind my painted smile I feel like a naked child\nMaybe rapping ain't for now cos my passion is fading out\nUp early though I search and roam along this dirty road\nJust another traveller taking a long journey home\n\n[Akala]\nAll this talk of intervention to protect on what is the intention\nSame as it ever was the colonial past and present\nAnd more respect for most of the right wingers\nThan the paternalistic patronising liberal bigot\n\n[Lowkey]\nOur way of life is so divine, we should intervene\nSelect war and export the British dream\nBehind cinema screens there's much that isn't seen\nGeorge Clooney war movies never bring our children peace\n\n[Akala]\nYo fam, you ever wake up and just feel like fucking off,and never coming back to this place and just cutting off?\n\n[Lowkey]\nAll the time, almost did last year the trouble was the bloody cops had me running in and out the bloody dock\n\n[Akala]\nI been there brother, though I don't promote it in this rap shit, I ain't a stranger to having my back on their blue plastic\n\n[Lowkey]\nCan't keep us captive\n\n[Akala]\nWe see the tactics\n\n[Lowkey]\nTo keep us passive\n\n[Akala]\nWe beat the fascists\n\n[Lowkey]\nRelease the classics\n\n[Akala & Lowkey]\nAnd reach the masses!\n\n[Hook]x2", "year": "2012-05-28", "album": "Knowledge Is Power Vol. 1", "image": "https://images.genius.com/95f4dbc07c7455e0bbf14b55f99cc7a0.918x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
