Uh huh\nIt's poppin (It's poppin), it's poppin' (It's poppin')\nYeah... okay...\nI gotta ask 'em...\n'Cause if I don't...\nIt's poppin (It's poppin), it's poppin! (It's poppin')\nI dunno... Let's go!\n\n[Chorus]\nWhatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?\nWhatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?\nThey say my lip gloss is cool, my lip gloss be poppin'\nI'm standin' at my locker, and all the boys keep stoppin'\nWhatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?\nWhatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?\nThey say my lip gloss is poppin', my lip gloss is cool\nAll the boys keep jockin', they chase me after school\n\n[Verse 1]\nMac (Mac) L'Oreal, yep, 'cause I'm worth it\nLove the way I puts it on so perfect\nWipe the corners of my mouth so I work it\nWhen I walk down the hallway, they cain't say nothin'\nOh, oh, oh, my lips so luscious\nThe way I spice it up with the Mac-Mac brushes\nL'Oreal got them wat-ballermelon crushes\nThat's probably the reason all these boys got crushes\n\n[Chorus]\nWhatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?\nWhatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?\nThey say my lip gloss is cool, my lip gloss be poppin'\nI'm standin' at my locker, and all the boys keep stoppin'\nWhatchu know 'bout me?

Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?\nWhatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?\nThey say my lip gloss is cool, my lip gloss be poppin'\nI'm standin' at my locker, and all the boys keep stoppin'\nWhatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?\nWhatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?\nThey say my lip gloss is poppin', my lip gloss is cool\nAll the boys keep jockin', they chase me after school\n\n[Breakdown]\n'Cause my lip gloss - is poppin' (Is poppin')\nIs poppin! (Is poppin)\n'Cause my lip gloss - is poppin' (Is poppin')\nIs poppin! (Is poppin)\n\n[Verse 3]\nSittin' in eighth period, thought I was in trouble\nDean called me on the loudspeaker on the double\nI stepped in her office like \"Yes, Ms. McClarkson?\"\nShe like, \"Gurl, I ran out of my lip gloss\nAnd write down where you get yours from\n'Cause I must admit, that bubblegum\nIs poppin' (Is poppin')\nIs poppin!\"\nShe ain't frontin'\nN-uh, I be lovin' it, I be, I be lovin it n-uh\nI be usin' it, I be I be usin' it n-uh\nI be rubbin it, I be I be rubbin it\nOn my lips, my lips (Ah) my lip gloss\n\n[Chorus]\nWhatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?\nWhatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?\nThey say my lip gloss is cool, my lip gloss be poppin'\nI'm standin' at my locker, and all the boys keep stoppin'\nWhatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?\nWhatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?\nThey say my lip gloss is poppin', my lip gloss is cool\nAll the boys keep jockin', they chase me after school"}], "artist": "Lil\u2019 Mama"}
