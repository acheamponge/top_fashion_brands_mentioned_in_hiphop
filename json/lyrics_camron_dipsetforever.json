A check for two mil'\nAnd a cheap case, defaced, blue steel, true skills\nI got stories that my soul can sing\nFlip water like Poland Spring and I'ma hold them things\n\n[Break]\n{Forever} that's right y'all\nDiplomats y'all, we here\n{Forever, yea-yeah} that's forever man\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook, talk to 'em\nLook, my fella said you been coppin' a lot\nLatest caper?
