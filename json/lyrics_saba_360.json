Diddys, ebonys and vibes\nWe busy splitting the find\nWe the divine\nBe careful when you are so\nNo creativity control\nYou can round your shelf\nYou can round, be stealth mode\nYou can round, can't write your album\nLook around, get exposed\nYou went to the bank to withdraw\nAs quick as it comes in it goes\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't want you, I don't need you\nBut you're in my head, you're in my head\nYou're in my head\nThey don't mean to but they feed you\nNow you're in my head, you're in my head\nYou're in my head\nThey show you all the lines\nYou think of all the lies\nYou change me for the price\nIs the girl, she 18\nYou supposed to pay it\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf I let you paint my soul\nIs my story told?\nOr will I just have shit that I don't want?\nNot to brag, or boast, or flaunt\nI wish passion was enough\nI wish fashion was just fun\nLike, what's in my closet?\nJust a desposit\nI don't desire to have attire\nWorn by entire consonants\nTo start a trend, 2Pac, a pen\nApocalypse, the coliseum\nPut that on TMZ\nPromoting your order reptilian\nBipolar, I told her I'm different\nThey only think I run an idiot\nAnd it won't be me\nWho they want, they split like Jodeci\nBut I won't let them make more than me\nYour fortune's unfortunately in the hand of an elder man\nWho is telling you you should wait\nAnd what's the profit off you?\nAnd them, what's the pension?\nIt's just pimpin' to get you and get you\nIt's still happening\nStill, that penmanship need practice\nFor when that signature for talents\nExchanged for business in your palace\nYou moved your mother to a mansion\nI got it, I got it\nMy money, my pocket\nMy lawyer, my lighter\nThat soul, my body\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't want you, I don't need you\nBut you're in my head, you're in my head\nYou're in my head\nThey don't mean to but they feed you\nNow you're in my head, you're in my head\nYou're in my head\nThey show you all the lines\nYou think of all the lies\nYou change me for the price\nIs the girl, she 18\nYou supposed to pay it", "album": "Adult Swim Singles Program 2017/2018"}], "artist": "Saba"}
