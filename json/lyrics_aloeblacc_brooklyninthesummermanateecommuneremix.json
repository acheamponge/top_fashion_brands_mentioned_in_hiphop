Just like you always did\nAnd now you're in all of my words, only way I can return\nMemories fade in reverse, but you will always be heard\nWherever I can sing, you'll be right there with me\nIn ghosts and melodies that only I can see\n\n[Chorus]\nYou feel like Brooklyn in the summer\nBeen hiding, half awake for so long\nAnd it's the subtleties only you've ever seen\nBringing the mess of me back together\nYou feel like Brooklyn in the summer\nBeen stumbling, half awake for so long\nGotta forget that feeling, give into something real\nI've got, I've gotta let you go\n\n[Bridge]\nBut maybe I'm not really ready to give up you\n'Cause nobody ever mattered to me like you do\n'Cause you're so appealing, I caught that feeling\nAnd touch the ceiling, ooh\nI wish I could describe it but words just ain't enough\nAnd nothing that I could say would ever measure up\nBut what I can't stand is you're outta my hands\nAnd I'm outta your plans, ooh\n\n[Chorus]\nYou feel like Brooklyn in the summer\nBeen hiding, half awake for so long\nAnd it's the subtleties only you've ever seen\nBringing the mess of me back together\nYou feel like Brooklyn in the summer\nBeen stumbling, half awake for so long\nGotta forget that feeling, give into something real\nI've got, I've gotta let you go", "title": "Brooklyn in the Summer (Manatee Commune Remix", "album": "Helix (Volume 2)"}], "artist": "Aloe Blacc"}
