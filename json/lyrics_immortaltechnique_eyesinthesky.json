Same as a crash flight that took off when the music died on your last night\nTell 'em the truth and they call you a traitor\nTalk to 'em honestly and they call you a hater\nLosing my composure cause the message is urgent\nTalking reckless, drunk on the mic, like Larry Merchant\nCursing at the serpent Sumerian demons\nWho brush their wings against the air that I'm breathin'\nA heathen with nothing left to believe in. Even a reason from living that was forgiven by God and not religion\nEnvision Jesus risen from the dead like Horus\nIn the baptist church shaking off the rigor mortis\nThe borders should be illegal instead of the people\nThat were here before the Bible and all of its sequels\nI speak to the detached and unrealistic\nThat were born normal but turned socially autistic\nWe resisted homeland securities mission\nBecause I know what they really envisioned\n\n[Hook x2]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d17ee30cab427a6ea7fa3bfa64561580.400x400x1.jpg", "album": "The Martyr", "year": "2011-10-27"}]}
