Aguilera]\nEveryone thinks that I have it all\nBut it's so empty living behind these castle walls\nThese castle walls\nIf I should tumble if I should fall\nWould anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls\nThere's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nObserving the estate through the gate from the outside looking in\nBet you would think I got it made, better look again\nI got a butler, got a maid, and a mansion\nThe belief is that I'm living out a millionaire's fantasy\nWith phantoms and ferrari's in the driveway\nBut you see the fame's in exchange for the same man's sanity\nYour vision jaded by the Grammy's on the mantelpiece\nJust switch your camera lenses you would see the agony\nApparently, it's damaging the man you see before you\nOn the canvas, he may seem alright but all the disadvantages his family\nEncounters overshadows his extravagance\nWalk in my nines a while I dare you, would it scare you\nWhile it surely seem like King's life ain't glamorous\nAs seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs\nBecause the camera doesn't see beyond the walls of the smiles\nOnly counts until it falls in the pile\n\n[Hook: Christina Aguilera]\nEveryone thinks that I have it all\nBut it's so empty living behind these castle walls\nThese castle walls\nIf I should tumble if I should fall\nWould anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls\nThere's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nHonestly to me, I think I'd lose every benefit of all that I've accomplished\nIf my kids never win at shit\nMe knowing this, why should the verses I have laid\nBe more important to me than the persons I have raised\nI guess I'm saying that to say that opportunity\nBut they just don't equate to all the time they take away\nFrom the kids all the shit I did right is a mistake\nIf Deyjah end up a stripper and Major slinging yay\nHow could I ever consider myself a great\nIf Messiah ain't paid and Nique Nique ain't straight\nWould your favourite song about the whips, money and shit\nBe relevant if you found out, Domani wasn't rich, nope\nSo me being the G.O.A.T. shouldn't mean more to me\nThan seeing to it King go\nFrom a badass kid to a man with some dough\nOtherwise I may as well have stayed poor\nOtherwise I may well have stayed poor\nSo while they stay focused on me beefin with Flip\nShawty Lo, Gucci or Ludacris\nOr if I'm fucking with a ho\nDid I snitch when I got arrested or will I die over nonsense\nInternally I'm dealing with this conflict\nSo excuse me if I don't get the chance to kiss the hand\nThat slap me in the face, ay I'm just a man\nIf they saying I ain't the best at making hit records\nIt's cause this my life these ain't just rapping\nShit, you think of that deep, did you dawg\nSee you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls\nBitch ain't thinking with the deep, did you dawg\nCause see you can't see the castle through the walls till it falls\n\n[Hook: Christina Aguilera]\nEveryone thinks that I have it all\nBut it's so empty living behind these castle walls\nThese castle walls\nIf I should tumble if I should fall\nWould anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls\nThere's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls\n\n[Bridge: Christina Aguilera]\nNobody knows I'm all alone\nLiving in this castle made of stone\nThey say that money is freedom, but I feel trapped inside it all\nAnd while I sit so high up on a throne\nI wonder how I can feel this low\nOn top of the world, it's beautiful\nBut there's no place to fall\n\n[Verse 3: T.I.]\nFor the record ay, I give a damn if I never said shit again\nMy career was meant for me to come and tell it\nHonest interpretation of how affected I'm faced with\nMatters most rappers used to keep locked away in the basement\nBut the day that I walk away I ain't saying that I'm amazing\nDownplaying the way I kept fellas from catching cases\nWon't take into consideration how much it mean what I'm saying\nAnd when I say what I mean even when I'm surrounded by the fakest\nFrom one of the greatest sinners, blessed with most of God's graces\nWho made his way amongst the greatest from the grimiest places\nSo next time you rating royalty, I'm always being given to recordings than the level\nOf your loyalty, obvious you've been ignoring me\nWho else you seen make it through the storm, unharmed disjointed\nWhile all the critics was looking for Prince Charming\nDisregarded the king of the south raised doubt\nEven though he made a castle out of what used to be a house\nHe did shit that all your favorites rappers only rap about\nBut most of y'all don't see the castle through the walls\nAnd the smiles till it falls in piles so while\n\n[Hook: Christina Aguilera]\nEveryone thinks that I have it all\nBut it's so empty living behind these castle walls\nThese castle walls\nIf I should tumble if I should fall\nWould anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls\nThere's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls"}], "artist": "T.I."}
