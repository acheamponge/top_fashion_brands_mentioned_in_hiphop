barely breathing\nWhat's a dream differed if you the one that don't believe it\nI present a different thesis projected through my secretion\nMy competition is seething, but knowledge is what I'm seeking\n\nIIII kill it right off of the bat and I'm bringing the heat\nA nigga would never compete\nThe people are waiting to see\nThe realest of rappers that get on the beat\nWith the way that I murder the flow and I show when I go at incredible speeds\nI'm something that you never seen, my lyrics are mean\nI'm turning 'em all into fiends, and giving a villainous scheme\nThey hearing the scream, I said that I'm reigning supreme\nThe fuck did you mean?\nA nigga is living the dream, I'm broker than ever\nIt's not getting better they give it a maximum effort\nDependent upon the endeavor, they faker than fuck\nAnd I said that I'm feeling the vibe\nA lyrical Jekyll and Hyde is really alive\nI craft a masterful sentence like a scientific formula\nForm of the fornication I formulated defacing\nThen pacing, taking my time but I'm tryna develop patience\nPreposterous that your ponderance possibly wasn't vacant\nMistaking my dedication for degradation with decadence\nDestitute and aloof I'm eluding ever-evasively\nMy focus and concentration taken with inconsideration\nHere's the situation, I could be a future constellation\nMinus consternation, this sentence is just because I made it\nConfiscated from the complications of my confirmation\nGuess my conversations are compilations of records\nWas lacking some type of content, they wanted the realest of concepts\nThe way that I spit it I said it at convents, enough of your nonsense\nI'm coming up quick with this shit and I'm giving it quick, the music is filling they clips\nI think I'm accustomed to hate, 'cause people are fake and that's why I can never relate\nThe time that that took to create\nThe passion I have is the reason I feel that I'm great\nWas given at birth, determine a personal worth, they said that the flow wouldn't work\nInstead I'mma leave 'em immersed, I'm putting my pain up inside of a verse\nI'm dotting my I's and I'm crossing my T's\nI'm one of the best that nobody has seen\nThey came in to know me fatigued, the moment they leave, I said that I'm taking the lead\nBut why are you looking confused, the beat is abused\nNow wait you amused, the fuck was the literal muse\nI'm giving a beautiful view, you came in the game with a crew\nI do what I do and I'm doing it better than you, but I thought that you already knew\nI murder the beat and I said that I rip in it right, it's everything that you like\nI masterminded a massacre, manifested majestically\nMutilated your majesty, marginally imagining\nFathoming you could ever step to me but never recklessly\nOr disrespectfully accept to dissipate discrepancies\nI speak insistently as I simplify for the listener\nSympathize with the sinister, magnify it for menaces\nMaximizing the minuscule, minimal effort given\nBy rappers making a living, for instance I been insisting\nThis game's in need of assistance, persistence has been the difference\nThe time I put into my sentences so you remember this relentlessness\nOffended with pads, pencils, and pendulums\nPopping pills of prescriptions, proprietors of addiction\nA crucifix oughta fix 'em, that's automatic forgiveness\nAn artificial confession that's purifying your senses\nWhat I spit is A-I-D-S, are you impressed?\nMy flow's an immune deficiency as I officially\nBut more specifically proficiently, even known as prolifically\nBut I'm envisioning that\nThey loving the way that I'm making it drop\nI come for the tip of the top who wanted the nigga to stop\nThey give a ridiculous plot, he's stirring a line\nAnd whether I like it or not they fuck with the way that I rock\nI'm taking my time when I murder the feeling\nThe realest of niggas to be in the building\nThe illest of villains, defending a phony is fame\nThey giving a sickening claim and play an erroneous game\nAs I'm resurrecting my name\nMy lyrics they bang, I'm leaving a nigga to hang\nI'm knowing you take it in vain, but let me explain\nI'll tell you the reason I came, it wasn't for taking the blame\nI said that I'm working your brain, they feeling ashamed\nAs I was remaining the same, I told 'em I would never change\nI feel like I'm going insane\nThe point that I'm wanting to make is that niggas are fake\nAnd I finally found where they made a mistake\nWhen they focus on everything but the rhyme\nAnd not really taking they time, the way I design my intricate difficult lines\nI bet that I'm blowing your mind, but what do I find\nThese niggas don't listen to mine, they telling me I'll never shine\nI wanted to make it sublime, they told me that that was a crime\nArrested if I actually try, convincing myself that I'm fine\nCondemning the way that I rhyme, I guess I'm ignoring the sign\nBut there was no one that could find these niggas that giving you lies\nBut nothing I'm seeing is real, I'm telling you what I despise\nMy nigga, I go to the fullest extent and I'm getting revenge with a pen\nAnd I'm telling you stories and sins, that I'm living my life with no friends\n\nSellin' lifestyles over half of these companies, of course it's for a couple fees\nNothin' I hear but logic can actually fuckin' comfort me\nAudacity to think that I could make it in this industry without a label backin' me\nDoing it independently but my dependency\nUpon the music is confusing, conflicted by what I'm viewing\nAnd what the public is choosing, they're puppeteers of careers\nAnd these strings are made of veneer so I'm making it crystal clear\nThat my future is what I fear 'cause I know I'm destined for loneliness\nHopelessly, I devoted my time in a pipe dream\nAnd it seems that my aspirations were actually asinine\nWith the hours that I have wasted, should have listened to the niggas that said I would never make it, they taking my lack of confidence and try to call it modesty\nNever display my talent\nI'm tryna die nigga, honestly, ironically\nI'll probably never have to do it by myself, my local government will help\nAnd they're not interested in my mental health 'cause nowadays\nIt's legal to murder a nigga for wearing a hoodie and eating some Skittles\nThey heads' in the sky but a nigga went out with a bullet that came from an ignorant cop\nAnd I'm wondering when this'll stop, killing my generation with they shots\nThat isn't a shock, disgusted by what I am watching\nWondering if I see this from a cop that they'll capitalize on the shock in the streets\nThe land of the free and the home of the brave, at least for the people that's paid\nThe pain and the poverty causing disdain, it's simple and plain\nIt's in a residual change, and everything is the same\nI'm telling the truth, so why the fuck does no one listen\nKillers who wearing a patch that was given to them by the sickening system\nHa, yeah\n\nAnd right now I ain't nothing, I'm not even in demand\nBut one day I'll be in your conversation like an ampersand\nYou understand, I ain't nothing, I'm not even in demand\nBut one day I'll be in your conversation like an ampersand\nYou understand, I ain't nothing, I'm not even in demand\nBut one day I'll be in your conversation like an ampersand\nYou understand, uh-uh\n\nKnowledge, bitch (pay attention)"}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
