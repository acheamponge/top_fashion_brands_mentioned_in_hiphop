{"songs": [{"lyrics": "Once upon a time in the days of yore\nWhen the people lived fresh out of legend and folklore\nThere was an old geezer with his teeth to the curb\nHe had a hook and a line and a sinker and a worm\nSlept in a city that kissed the seashore\nWoke with a bait-and-tackle store trip each morn\nNot a bother, not a lot to say\nThat is until you ask about the one that got aw-w-w-way\n\nLike a tall tale, keep it rod and reel\nWith his arms stretched out to define the kill\nWhile the village always listened, believin' it was different\nOut of eight million stories there was not a single witness\nIt was always at the last second when the line snapped\nOr the boat broke in half from the size of the catch\nEither way the documented proof didn't exist\nSo the locals dismissed the big f-f-f-fish\n\nBilly-goat beard twenty years in the making\nCarried lures in his brim, carried beer in his waders\nStinked like alcohol of all prominent flavors\nCarried knives in his vest, carried war in his nature\nSat among the forest floor critters and pine cones\nCould tie a perfect fly with his eyes closed\nVeteran angler with a mission to run\nMake all naysayers hold t-t-t-tongues\n\nPale blue moon or fiery orange glow\nRed sky at dawn or rain, hail, sleet, snow\nBlack storm cloud with the barometric horrors\nThe weatherproof sportsman spins yards regardless\nLaugh if you wanna, but the dude ain't stupid\nLet it roll off his back like drizzle off plumage\nCause he woke with a twinkle in his eye\nAnd every dog has his day and today is m-m-m-mine", "title": "Fishtales", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/64fbb9620a6b5e79e87c654b74da5441.640x640x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
