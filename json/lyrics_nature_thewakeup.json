No label. Too big for the label kid. Fucking giant. I'm a giant kid. I'm a giant know what I'm saying? Yo, we doing it again? We taping?\n\n[Verse]\nAyo I wake up everyday\nShit, shower, shave\nCheck all my messages, six hours late\nEat a quick breakfast, then gotta skate\nHit the ATM\nNow I'm straight\nIn a world where the broke don't eat, I let niggas know\nInterfere and we both won't eat\nYou know me, I be the type that follow the kids home\nMight throw a brick right through the window\nI might send a chick that's too hot to pass\nAnd the second you stop she'll pop that ass\nIt ain't about the cash or good looks\nSongs with good hooks that help me get on a good foot\nWhen you off to a slow start\nI give you a good push, help you go far\nCall you out, if you pus' you got no heart\nBlood in the veins, thugging hard till nothing remains\nWhat the fuck"}], "artist": "Nature"}
