Like beepers?\nBetter not come see me, that wouldn't be smart\nI'll paint the town red, and call it street art\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Fixedgear E]\nWhy burn slow when there's napalm\nWhy drop knowledge when I can drop bombs\nWhy everything about me so mean\nAnd why I gotta fux with all of this lean\nWhy u think u finna win when I'm Autobots\nBut the better question is why not\nI got more gadgets than terminator\nFuture celebrity problems while I'm trying to be greater\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Fixedgear E]\nBetter run home before it gets dark\nMe and my boys mobbin' like sharks\nI have too much swag for you lames\nBetter bring a pen n take notes of my game\nIf you touch my girl, ill break your arm\nChop u up like a cow at a farm\nY'all haters keep adding fuel to my fire\nI'm future hall of fame when I retire\n\n[Hook]\n\nDespicable Me, Fixedgear E (repeated x 4)\n\n[Hook]", "year": null}]}
