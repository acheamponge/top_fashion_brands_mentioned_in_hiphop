Yo, yo yo - you wanna hear that story 'bout that nine dirt-bomb brothers from Shaolin, you better cop that Raw\nYo, yo, yo March 6th, Raw, I'ma give it to you, pick up that book\n\n[Outro]\nWhat you lookin' at?\nYou all a bunch of fuckin' assholes. You know why? You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be?\nYou need people like me. You need people like me so you can point your fuckin' fingers and say, \"That's the bad guy\n\" So... what that make you? Good? You're not good\nYou just know how to hide, how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. Me, I always tell the truth. Even when I lie\nSo say good night to the bad guy!\nThe last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again, let me tell you. Make way for the bad guy. There's a bad guy comin' through!", "title": "Outro", "year": "2018-02-02", "album": "Bring Back God II"}], "artist": "U-God"}
