The odds are up against a real nigga\nHow does it feel to see my blood spill my nigga?\nMy life, my life, feel like I'm runnin' out of time\nTil' it's over catch me runnin' with my 9\n\n[Chorus]\n(How does it feel?)\nWhen you can't make the pain stop\nWalkin' in the rain so your tears can blend in with the raindrops\n(How does it feel?)\nWhen your key people's done turned they back\nEvery family that I know is just like that\n(My nigga, how does it feel?)\nWhen you can't make the pain stop\nWalkin' in the rain so your tears can blend in with the raindrops\n(How does it feel?)\nWhen your key people's done turned they back\nEvery family that I know is just like that (Uh-huh, uh-huh)", "year": "2002-04-16", "image": "https://images.genius.com/83995d2527f5e63d7b5da485e9eabc9a.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
