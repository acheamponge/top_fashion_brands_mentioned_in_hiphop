Find a sick dick, suck it and die\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nDem boys don't have no gun, dem boys don't have so license\nThey call me Sai-giddy, some people say that I'm the nicest\nWhen it comes to getting busy on these mic devices\nI ain't a problem, I'm a crisis\nI'm getting all the ladies, spoiled as a baby\nI'll never ever let a batty bwoy investigate me\nI'd rather death convey me. No, I mean yes, it's crazy\nThese young niggas ain't seemin' to get the message lately\nWe need warriors, that's true story, bruh\nWe got a couple but we need a few more of ya\nCuz not by any means should out of twenty teens\nEighteen of them niggas be wearing skinny jeans (nah, man)\nWe do it for Bob Marley, for Marcus Garvey\nProbably all of the rastafari\nAin't nobody fucking with me\nWho, Saigon? Yeah, that nigga. Go touch him and see. [gunshot]\n\n[Hook]", "album": "Warning Shots 3: One Foot in the Grave"}], "artist": "Saigon"}
