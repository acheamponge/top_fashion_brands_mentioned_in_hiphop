And earth has nothing I desire besides You. My flesh, my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion.\"\nEven if my heart may fail\nDoctors say all ain't swell, pockets ain't swell\nI wanna show that You're enough\nIf You ain't there, You can keep heaven I don't care as long as You're here\nImma show that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nI wanna show that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nI wanna show that You're enough\n\nDoes God have a wonderful plan for my life?\nPlans to expand and land me at heights\nPossibly sovereignly and landin' a wife\nAnd His hand in my life is an answer to my life\nI don't know and I really shouldn't care\nCause what is any of that to His love and kindness?\nParticularly giving me breath and my body\nOn top of you saving a sinner outer inner all that you given me\nJesus wasn't fly, Jesus wasn't cool\nIsaiah 53:2 says that Jesus wasn't cute\nHe was poor sorrowful, Isaiah 53:2\nHe's the master you're the servant\nWhat you think is in store for you?\nIs He enough?\n\nI'm all good, I'm so content\nAnd I don't even gotta large house with a fence\nMaybach, Benz, with A/C and tints\nOr courtin' a girl that submits till the end\n(Nah) Cause this ain't a trend\nAnd all that stuff could remain absent\nSo I'm persistent to stay consistent\nTo show the whole world that God's sufficient\n\nEven if my heart may fail\nDoctors say all ain't swell, pockets ain't swell\nI wanna show that You're enough\nIf You ain't there, You can keep heaven I don't care as long as You're here\nImma show that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nI wanna show that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nI wanna show that You're enough\n\nI don't wanna just talk, I got to show\nCause I gotta couple brothers in the hospital\nAnd I gotta couple brothers from across the globe\nPoor or sick, with joy you got to know\nFeelin' bad, you tell em I wanna pray for you\nBut they feel worse sayin' they wanna pray for you\nOh you thinkin' we got it worse, it's a mistake for you\nLivin' in America is what's great to you\nNo hatin' you, prosperity's replaced the truth\nWhen God is only enough, if enough when He's gracin' you\nY'all don't value faith, you only value what your faith can do\nY'all love to eat but hate on the Person who made the food\nSo I'll pray for you but let's make a truce\nWhen famine hits you won't ignore the light like an ambulance\nHold on to the Savior even in the midst of your affliction\nRemember our condition your afflictions ya chance to witness\n\nEven if my heart may fail\nDoctors say all ain't swell, pockets ain't swell\nI wanna show that You're enough\nIf You ain't there, You can keep heaven I don't care as long as You're here\nImma show that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nI wanna show that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nShow that You're enough\nI wanna show that You're enough"}], "artist": "KB"}
