Blowin swishers\n\n[Verse 2]\nMan and I'm high as hell\nYeah my life is like a movie hope you got a still\nI'm ill mufucka, I don't need a meal\nBut my pockets got the munchies and feed em well\nWhy your money lookin like it's on the diet pill?\nI can eyeball that, I ain't gotta scale\nSplit it down, dump it nigga\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd I'm tryna smoke with all of y'all\nRolling papers, man I feel like a ball hog\nI can't pass that the way I hit\nThat's only one round, Mike Tyson\nAin't no papers in my house, I don't write shit\nBut your bitch is prolly here on a nightshift\nBaby stop by the store, but I don't need liquor\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4]\nCause I'mma get you high tonight\nOnce you learn how to roll, it's a riding bike\nSaid I'm over niggas heads on Cloud 9\nFuck what you got, my nigga smell mine\nThis ain't a art gallery, why everybody starin'?\nGot a house full of bunnies where the fuck is Anna Faris?\nI'm in the cut, you can keep your Rizla's\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 5]\nAnd I don't wanna hear that it tastes good\nOne hit of this, you feel it and your face good\nWe cookin baby you can meet me over here\nGot everybodys eyes lookin' medium rare\nHow I'm comin on the beat is fucking really unfair\nSee the haters talk shit, but I really don't care\nYou can all suck a dick and feel it in your throat nigga\n\n[Hook]"}]}
