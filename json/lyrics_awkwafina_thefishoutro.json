I was on the other side of the tracks, I had to go up the stairs, walk down, walk back down to say hi to Bingbing Fan and your fucking name is Awkwafina. Because you know what, I was gonna go to SUGARFISH and get a Trust Me box, and guess what. Trust me, you just fucking ruined my lunch, okay? I, uh, good luck with you, and everything you do, and your fucking mango leather jacket and you're wearing Sketchers, okay. Who wears Sketchers?\n\n[Awkwafina]\nYou, you don't, you really don't have to be mean. I mean, I'm just, I'm like, this whole conversation-\n\n[Stranger]\nNo, but seriously, who the fuck is Awkwafina?", "year": "2018-06-08"}]}
