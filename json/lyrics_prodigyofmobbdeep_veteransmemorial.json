I'll Will burnin'\nHarry, fuck yo, I can't take no more man\nFrankie, Spank, whattup man? Straight up\nMy grandmoms man, my granddad man\nGrandma Brooks, straight up my pops man\nStraight up man, that's it\nAll my dead, all my dead\nMan, the little babies man, no more man\nAbortion babies man, I can't take no more man\nI'll never forget you, all my dead it's all love man\nMotherfuckin' Yambo, in a minute, we'll be there\nMotherfuckin' Yammy, straight up, I can't wait\nYou was my strength nigga, I miss y'all\nI can't believe you gone nigga\n(You was supposed to be right here)\nWhat the fuck happened?\nAin't nobody else goin' away man\nYou ain't takin' nuttin' else from me man\nNobody can't take nuttin' else from me man, that's it\nI dare you! Come try, it's over man\nYou can't take nuttin' else from us yo\nThat's my word, I put my life on it I'll be next nigga, straight up\nI'll stand up for that\n'Cause ain't none of my niggas goin', that's enough\nWe had enough\nIt's the Veteran's Memorial right here man\nStraight up, man\nWe love y'all, one love", "year": "2000-11-14"}]}
