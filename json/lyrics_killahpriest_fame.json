Don't stop till you get a zillion dollars\nThen what? Enemies at ya door\nHidin' ya money under floor\nDon't trust ya whore, screenin' ya cause\nNiggas used to be cool, but ain't cool no more\nNow you gon' to war, just made a deal as a business man\nLawyers jerkin' you, you can't trust ya fam\nGot cancer from all the cigars\nNeva picture ya self on the I.V. because of liquor\nDreamin' of ya funeral, some niggas wanna shoot at you\nNow you being fed thru a tube, the suspect's unusual\nKings die, thrones rust, skeleton bones turn to dust\nThis money you trust - hard luck\nNow you get stuck, your family is fucked\nThat's what happens when guns buss\n\n(Hook) 2x\n\n[Killah Priest]\nGame recognize game, G's recognize G's\nShootouts in the rain cuz of M O N E Y\nWhy my nephew had to die? Eye for an eye\nTooth for tooth, my fam for ya fam\nNiggas just shoot\nWhile we talkin' their lives are coffin\nIf he go they put his riches in the auction (Damn!!)\nLuck, teardrops and pain, hug, fears, stops the rain\nThe bullets and a kiss\nA buncha Brooklyn kids cried that day\nWhen the hearse roll thru wit BIG\nListen to the vision Martin had\nShots in the flag, David rocks in his bag\nWe love money, buss slugs for money\nWould you sell ya moms for money?\nSoon, all in tuned\nThat's what will be required from this country, doom!"}]}
