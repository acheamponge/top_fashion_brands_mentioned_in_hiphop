C'mon, this is me\nYou know you'll get it back, aiyyo yea that's a fact\nI've already lost a job, and plus be smokin that\nOff with you give the dough, cause youse a true friend\nBut what ya know now if you only knew then\nHe wouldn'ta got jacked, for the big smack\nAnd it's only right, because it's like that\n\n[Chorus] + ad libs\n\n\"That's when you find out who your REAL friends are!\"", "year": "1992-11-03"}]}
