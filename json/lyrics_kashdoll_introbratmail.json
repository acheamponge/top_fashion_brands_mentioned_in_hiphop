Please stop it!\nBlowing money\nAll in Neiman's in there Diddy bopping\nAnd you know I came to murder it\nMy city watching\nI'm so humble, I'ma front like I don't do this often\nIt's Kash Doll, bow down, and kiss the ring\nSoon as this paperwork done\nI'm touching everything\nA murder scene\n\n[Outro]\nHaha\nYeah, that way!\nThe doll way!"}], "artist": "Kash Doll"}
