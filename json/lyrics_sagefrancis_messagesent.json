If you're a girl that I miss\nYou'll eventually get my virtual good bye kiss\nThe rest are addressed to my friends and the subject line is \"Just check this fine bitch\"\nAnd the one for myself's untitled but...it's the same virus\n\nMy wrists get slit on your shoulder blades\nWhen I lose my grip when I hold your face\nLet it drip on your golden laced silver slip\nSpilling all over the place\nI'd lay my jacket over the blood puddle when we go on dates\nTo prove I'm a gentleman, peddling my bike at a slower pace\n\n\"The sum of the parts doesn't equal the whole,\" she states\nBefore my parents get home I'll take\nTime to find the fragments of our relationship\nGlue back together this broken vase\n\nFalling in love is easy. Falling out of love takes a bit of practice\nI'm good at both without even owning a mattress\nI never asked for a kiss without deserving one\nIf you never saw me cry before\nWait for the next time I wake up on the wrong side of the floor\n\nI've got some letters inside of my drawer\nThat should have been sent by now\nSealed in an envelope\nOne is addressed to my ex\nAnd it says that I feel our friendship's a joke\nOne is addressed to my friend\nAnd it says his ex-girlfriend's on coke\nAnd one is addressed to myself on a personal note\nUnopened...filled with endless quotes\n\nWhenever I spoke, they'd close me in and bust my lip\nNow I wear parenthesis on my temples, step to the podium and just think\nWhenever lonely I shrink, and hold myself, squeezing tight\nBefore I sprawl out on the hardwood floor and kiss myself to sleep at night\n\nI have dreams of flight, but I'm not floating\nThe ground is approaching awful quick\nSo I wake up screaming for you to catch me\nThat's what I start every day off with\n\nI may talk shit, but ain't much else to do in this prison cell\nAnd lucky for me no one really listens well, especially when I diss myself\nI'll fly away on a pig when my living hell freezes over\nAnd since I'm used to the cold I'll be able to rest my head on Jesus' shoulder\n\nExplanations are in order for why these floor boards are always freezing\nGuess it'll all make sense once we get older and reach the Age of Reason\n'Til then, I'll have no reason to sleep in, Not even on weekends\nUnless we're together, 'cuz my willpower will probably weaken\n\nDeepen my appreciation for the current condition\n'Cuz I'm sick of always feeling like something is missing\nI slumber in one position. Crouched up and fetal-like\nThe couch sucks cuz my feet are like...given no space to breathe\nWhile I embrace my knees\n\nIts off to the floor 'cuz I can't sleep nowhere else\nThat's why I write these letters to all of y'all but never send 'em\nIt's better to just keep to myself", "album": "Personal Journals"}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
