It need me\nI swear to God I don't remember my name. A gypsy\nOn the sidewalk with a hump, and a cane\nWhat's a melody for art like this? Arthritis\nCare-giver on a Sunday, a hood bitch JK\nI left the hoodie in the crib. Fuck it\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nWhen I see my name in the lights, on a night\nWhen the moon bright, and the stars out; You can carve out a piece of my soul\nIt's gold like Jay Elect\nPresidente, El Camino to the Kinsey\nSixteen bars in sixteen seconds, I dream rap\nAll my metaphors got three wings it's angel pretty\nDangle with me from the gates unseen. Aunt Pearly, it's early\nAnd my God says goodmorning. Smelling like dime bags\nAnd rapping like young Lauryn. Prolific\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nDark liquor brands, rap game, the new Grandy\nDark metaphors, Noname the new nanny\nYou got a dollar? I could watch your granny, and her kid's kids\nBoth where they live, both in a bib\nCause rap money ain't money; temporary stage life\nI fell in love with metaphors, temporary page wife\nFirst verse was about my old job\nSecond verse was about a new God, who gone be that\nHalf drunk profit; Profiting where the weed at?\n\nNew Jazz Similie....\nLullaby the babies with the Similac & Hennessy\nBitter sweet, cause everything ain't about twerking\nUnless everything is about twerking"}], "artist": "Noname"}
