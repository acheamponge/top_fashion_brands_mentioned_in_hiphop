{"songs": [{"lyrics": "When I was young we wanted to get out the ghetto\nBut after we moved out of the ghetto\nIt was hard to get things we needed\n\nI took a picture in the hood\nStanding by the door\nWhite T shirt and black khakis\nSagging kind of low\nI see the corner that I worked\nWith my homies in the back\nLAPD searching us\nLooking for some crack\n\nI don't need to be the king of the world\nAll I need is some activator\nFor my Jehri curl\n\nCHORUS:\nCompton isn't too far away\nNeither is South Central LA\nNo matter what the cops try and say\n\nWe move from South Central\nTo the desert of the real high\nPalmdale-Lancaster\nBlue suburban sky\nWhen I come home late at night\nThe sheriff harasses me\nHe puts me in the choke hold\nSo bad I can barely breath\n\nI'm the hungry hustler Afroman\nI'm going parking lot platinum in my Astrovan\n\nCHORUS:\nCompton isn't too far away\nNeither is South Central LA\nNo matter what the cops try and say\nI'm selling yay\n\nI see police lights\nOn palmdale boulevard\nBack-up units pulling in\nI'm thinking oh my god\nI got nowhere else to go\nMy hands are in the air\nI don't know what to do\nBut you can't have my weed and my brew", "title": "Compton Isn\u2019t Too Far Away", "album": "Afroholic: The Even Better Times", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c4fd850563348aed762e3d484ea76e19.500x500x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Afroman"}
