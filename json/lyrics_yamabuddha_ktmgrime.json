I\u2019m fresher\nIf it\u2019s on I break bones you go home on a stretcher\nYes, sir! that\u2019s how I do\nComing at ya straight outta Kathmandu\nThink before you risk it, don\u2019t get it twisted\nY'all pigs sick 'cause of swine flu\nMind you! the most wanted\nPlus the flow is so supersonic\nHeaded for the summit, yeah, it\u2019s ironic\nAnything to everything you dream I done it\nYeah! I\u2019m on it\nYou think you the guy but you miss when you try\nReal talk! ain\u2019t done shit in ya life\nAll that you been spitting are lies\nYa vision is fucked up like dick in ya eyes\nI\u2019m elegant, equipped with required elements\nThe most definite to make you sink like sediments\nI meditate over the beat 'til I levitate elevated to the peak\nCelebrate better state 7 days of the week, a renegade never late generating the heat\nDemonstrate better ways to resonate the spit, relegate, decimate the best in the bizz\nA delegate renovating the shit, never hesitate, devastate while taking a piss\nLook! we shut down the best of parties\nDon\u2019t like me? I\u2019m ya girls best artist\nWhile you ain\u2019t making a move, you parking\nI push ignition like Sash Car Key (Karki)\nYB on a beat and it\u2019s over\nYB acapella, still over\nBring heat like squeezing a toaster\nFeed on MCs like an eating disorder\nGet deeper than the navy be\nCouldn't suck if I wanted like a baby Bee\nYou bound to fall off like baby teeth\n'cause writing a verse takes you 80 weeks\nAnd still all you rap is ABC\nCouldn't spit sick with rabies please\nAnd since ya bitch got laid by me\nI heard now you guys barely speak\nShit! You ain\u2019t a match\nTryna change the fact that you lame and wack\nDickriding too much got ya anus packed\nFlames I rap off the top 'til my brains is ash\nLook! I come alive in the night time\nGo hard like the fuck of a lifetime\nRock the show as you watch from the sidelines\nRun the underground flow like a pipeline\nUse my mind kinda like Einstein\nOn a doper addiction than white lines\nI thought ya crew warned you with a high sign\nI get more viewers than prime time", "title": "KTM Grime"}]}
