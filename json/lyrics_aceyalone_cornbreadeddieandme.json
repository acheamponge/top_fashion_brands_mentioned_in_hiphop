Booyaka! I'll put you in the ground\nA peaceful man ain't got no place here\nI guess you wanna see 'em all die with the lambs\nI face fear everyday 'til the space is clear\nThen I fight 'em like a man cause it's what I am\nSomebody told me the road to freedom is lonely\nBut I swear I ain't goin on my own\nI'm takin my sisters, my families, my homies\nNow I'm about to take this mother(fucker) home\n\nAiyyo the police short Cornbread in the street\nAnd they just killed Cochise over a beat\nJardine and the kids tryin to make ends me\nHalf dead and do dirty as some God damn thiefs", "title": "Cornbread, Eddie and Me", "album": "Magnificent City", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d377dd352876664b03799298f4325e48.600x600x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
