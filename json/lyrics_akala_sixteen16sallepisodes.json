Is the life of the mind no longer valid?\nIf we don't live what we think through daily habits\nI'm embarrassed to say, everyday I betray\nHow I think I'd like to live in this world, am I insane?\nOr the same as the hypocrites that I do disdain\nWhat would I do in their shoes? I know what I'd like to claim\nBut there's no way we could say, how we would behave\nIf we had a whole different life up to this day\nIs it innate? Encoded in our DNA?\nOr in the spirit that is born in this body that we enslave\nWhat is happiness for you might be hell for me\nDo you still get to pursue it to the fullest degree?\nWe'll see\n\n\nEp.5:( 03:39 ):\nGordon Bennet, I\u2019m flabbergasted\nSmart bastard, so bloody clever that it\u2019s just retarded\nI don\u2019t recite my charges, nor my type of garments\nTryna hype the hardests like half of these spineless bastards\nWho\u2019s the rhyming artist\nMy timin I have harnessed\nI\u2019m shinin\u2019 blinding partners the finest you find in varnish\nIt\u2019s my time regardless\nIf I should die with martyrs\nKnow that I was old school like Jamaican partners\nBut I\u2019m ahead of my time and the energy I harness\nBrilliant and like equivalent to 4 million karmas\nMy brain power\u2019s insane power I\u2019ve never charted\nYet I\u2019m known around the world for cremating carcass\nOf these half baked emcees that think they\u2019re masters\nBut they ain't nothing but a scam, like the naija pastors\nGo preaching to the people, but listen harder\nAnd you will hear that it\u2019s just bollocks like I am the dog\u2019s\n\n\nEp.6:( 04:21 ):\nThe flow\u2019s complex\nYou need music theory to see what is coming next\nThe crotchets and minus the riddims I will devour\nYou botched it but I\u2019m killin a million villains an hour\nSour are the faces of racists who face the power\nEven though they chat a shower of shit, they\u2019re really cowards\nSo if I do allow it to hit, you man are out\nI\u2019m more unconscious than you are already you ain't about it\nSo just allow it\nDon\u2019t stand the fuck up, nah have a seat\nIf you\u2019re so road then go back to the street\nBut never, rap on a beat you\u2019re crap I promise\nYour friends are not your friends cos clearly they are not honest\nYou can trust uncle Akala to keep it real\nAnd cos I signed myself I\u2019m always keepin the deal\nAin't been on commercial radio since 2006\nPerformed in 50 countries since so\nWho gives a shit, huh?\n\n\nEp.7:( 05:03 ):\nLife liberty in the pursuit of property\nProbably woulda been more proper terminology\nTo explain the world envisioned by a monopoly\nWhat do we do with this world we\u2019ve inherited\nWhat is happiness for you?\nWhat do you pursuit?\nWealth for the few as long as you\u2019re enjoying the view?\nAnd what does wealth guarantee?\nSome peace of mind, regular blowjobs and cars that are nicely designed?\nI\u2019m being superficial\nIt also guarantees that your children\u2019s school won't get hit by a missile\nOn the unlikely event that it does\nIt will be fucking hell to pay for a memorial written in blood\nMoney don\u2019t buy happiness, probably true\nWhat if it buys the closest thing then what do we do?\nWhat good is it loving all of the simple things\nIf the power the money brings takes em away at your whim\n\n\nEp.8:( 05:46 ):\nSo the saga runs on\nThis is still London same Billy with a truncheon\nNow aimin their guns on\nShots to the sternum\nCock Back Burn \u2018em\nOr choke an immigrant incase you brothers ain't learnin\nHere\u2019s a little reminder\nThe symbolic debt\nLike, when they use to hange \u2018em and tag \u2018em for stealin bread\nAnd all you were focused ons what the victim evolved with\nWhere they on the road did they wear a hoodie or smoke spliffs?\nCouldn\u2019t give a shit if they licked a million shots\nDeath penalty has been abolished, has it not?\nAnd I seen way more drugs at Glastonbury than Carnival\nBut they don\u2019t feel the need to send the police with arms at all\nAnd while the paedophiles walk free\nPublic enemy number one my brother its still you and me\nTo see what\u2019s going on, you ain't gotta be a clever sod\nIt\u2019s all about race and class just like it ever was\n\n\nEp.9:( 06:30 ):\nThis love is a drug\nThe way it affects the run of your blood\nNever to snub, but always eventually they do succumb\nOverrun, by thoughts that make you withering on\nYour own mum or anyone who has a slip of the tongue\nAnd there\u2019s the question\nWhile you\u2019re collecting tremendous sums\nWhile people are living in simplest villages even the wickedest slums\nDespite all the image and acting so innocent all of the pillaging\u2019s done\nSo you relax not knowing the facts of how it actually come\nWhat\u2019s next will power lose the head on it\u2019s neck?\nAnd will the one that comes after be like a master grafter?\nOr more disaster cos history\u2019s not a class in laughter?\nBut yesterday is not tomorrow so why do I trouble to answer\nI ain't sure if any war was fought for the poor\nAny persons working with a motive that is totally pure\nWhat I do know is the powerful won't hand it over\nYou gotta take it but nature might make you even colder\n\n\nEp.10:( 07:17 ):\nI drop a sixteen?
