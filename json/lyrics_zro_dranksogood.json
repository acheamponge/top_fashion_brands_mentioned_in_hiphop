So far it's just some mutts in here\nAt two o'clock women leave and they left the sluts in here\n(?) lil mamma, you can keep that\nMoney hungry ass bitch gone make me reach back\nI ain't worried about you ho, I'm too busy showin' up\nAnd everybody with me pourin' up, yeah\n\n[Hook]\nAnd it tastes so good\nAnd it tastes so good\nAnd it tastes so good\nAnd it tastes so good", "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/8204f7101d86abbc2079e7c24a44a3a5.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
