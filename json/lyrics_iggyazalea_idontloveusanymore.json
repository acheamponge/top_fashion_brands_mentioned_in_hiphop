Nah.\" (Nah.)\nDon\u2019t fuck with him (Uh uh.)\nYou had'a told me this in the beginning (Maybe.)\nI would'a said they was just hating\nWould'a defended you, like the debate team (I would.)\nBut now you saying shit just to bait me (Damn.)\nNow you ghost like Patrick Swayze\nI don\u2019t think I could bring it back\nI don\u2019t think we could seal the cracks (I\u2019m sorry.)\nPouring out what\u2019s best unsaid (Damn.)\nTime ends, making up our bed (Hmm.)\nAll that\u2019s left is for us to lay in it (Uh huh.)\nI should'a known you\u2019d be the one to stray from me (Ha, ha, ha.)\nSo the queen sits alone on the throne\nNext time you call, I\u2019ma give you a dial tone\n\n[Outro]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a4d7446580d45629c64c0cd44b5b045f.480x360x1.jpg", "album": null, "year": null}]}
