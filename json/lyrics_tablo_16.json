A pool of spit when I'm done, you sink in it\nLike a fattie in a skinny jean, I'm thick in it\nKickin' it down, obstacles and clowns\nBreakin' up the atoms and the particles of sound\n\n[Refrain]\nSupreme Tablo. This was just for fun\nImagine when I really try. Muthafuckas run\nSupreme Tablo. This was just for fun\nImagine when I really try. Muthafuckas run\n\n[Outro]\nMichelangelo had his Sistine\nTablo's got his 16\nMichelangelo had his Sistine\nTablo's got his 16"}], "artist": "Tablo"}
