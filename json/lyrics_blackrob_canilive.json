yeah, yeah, what what, yeah yeah\nYeah, what, yeah, what\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo\n\n[Verse 1: Jadakiss]\nYo, this is a monopoly, niggas ain't stopping me\nAnd we can't lose 'cause Puff set us up properly\nJust won't settle for lesser, who wanna test us\nWe be in the 5 with the goose headrests\nLOX put niggas under pressure\nYou shoulda knew that, it's always them new cats that'll get ya\nBetter start looking at things from my angle\nI'm trying to be up on the board with a triangle\nNext to my name with a ten or a twenty\nNow that's when you really can say you getting money\nBut right now all I do is sit back and listen\nTo a wise young man that quickly became a rich one\nPut me up on the fact that it ain't hard to get some\nChips if I just keep writing with ambition\nThen I get an advance from the five to the six and\nHouse with two kitchens, diamonds, plenty women\nBuilt-in pool to swim in\nBut the plan is to start from the floor and raise it up\nThen you hit em in the head 'til your days is up\nYou blazing what, playboy you frail and butt\nYou know when Bad Boy drops, all your sales is cut\n\n[Chorus: Black Rob]\nCan I live, no one man can stop me\nCan I live, no front-line can block me\nCan I live, its enough base for all of us\nCan I live, without the names they calling us\nCan I live, no one man can stop me\nCan I live, no front-line can block me\nCan I live, or do I gotta bring it to these kids\nCan I live, if I don't live nobody live\n\n[Verse 2: Styles P]\nTime is money, money is power so I'm sour\n22 feeling like I've wasted every hour\nOf my life, shoulda been had a million in ice\nHigh as a kite, feeling the flight, turbulence\nOnce in a blue moon I had a dream of fly shit\nHand-glide to the Alps with this fly chick\nCondo in Fresno with the lesbo\nAnd the honey that she hit know how to stretch blow\nThey know that I'm Styles they respect the flow\nWhy don't y'all let a nigga live and help him make a decimal\nTruth will set you free what will a lie do\nNiggas say I'm God but I be gettin' high too\nCan't love the money like the niggas beside you\nCause when the paper gone, you gon' slide too\nNiggas wanna ball, but got to fall to rise\nWhile the world spins around they wanna stall they eyes\nClose they ears my nose makes me oppose my fear\n'Cause I can smell hell\nBefore I sell rat I'll catch a shell farewell\nNiggas will never tell\nTheir man that I was pussy\nUnless they got a gun, and I ain't got one, I might let you push me\n\n[Chorus: Black Rob]\nCan I live, no one man can stop me\nCan I live, no front-line can block me\nCan I live, its enough base for all of us\nCan I live, without the names they calling us\nCan I live, no one man can stop me\nCan I live, no front-line can block me\nCan I live, or do I gotta bring it to these kids\nCan I live, if I don't live nobody live\n\n[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]\nI pray to God to promise me, before I see the pearly gates\nTo let my whole team be straight, mansion no Section 8\nPutting pressure so that I can make this bed\nGot two mattresses now all I need is the spread\nWith like four pillows so my seeds can rest their heads\nYou think platinum is enough, nah Sheek want more\nTrying to sell more than Tickle me Elmo in the store\nItalian cuisine, Linguine while my diamonds like-SHING\nSo when I move at night-time you might think it's light-NING\nJust throw me the ball once and I'll tell you no lie\nSheek gonna show you money, like Jerry McGuire\nIt's a thug thing, LOX product thing, conducting\nAnything for chips while you sit and blab your lips\nIn the restaurant taking tips while Sheek on trips\nLogos on our ships busting at the eclipse\nWhile I'm pissy, spitting up Crissy in the water\nBut you can do that for money, when 100's like a quarter\n\n[Chorus: Black Rob]\nCan I live, no one man can stop me\nCan I live, no front-line can block me\nCan I live, its enough base for all of us\nCan I live, without the names they calling us\nCan I live, no one man can stop me\nCan I live, no front-line can block me\nCan I live, or do I gotta bring it to these kids\nCan I live, if I don't live nobody live\n\n[Verse 4: Black Rob]\nThis is to my AK toters, money bill folders\nBambing soldiers, whips with big motors\nOn the low for years, the Feds can't decode us\nWe bust rounds, all you gotta do is load us\nMy night time prowlers, and grimy after hours\nKarl Kani, Mumalo wear, Eddie Bauers\nFlipping cake niggas, who strip and take niggas\nUpstate niggas, my Crystal Lake niggas\nWe gonna hold it down if we gotta shake niggas\nAnd make niggas do what we say, or break niggas\nSurvival of the fittest, it ain't me cause I did it\nNow you see me shinin 2 mill with my diamonds\nAnd I owe it all to hard grindin\nDon't mean I'm gonna stop climbin, 9-9, it's good timin\nI salute my thugs, who rock\nWith the drugs and switch guns, and pay 30 thou for the slug\nMake it happen, I swear to God if I don't make it rapping\nI'm clapping, extorting, and robbing niggas cribs and contacting\nCan I live\n\n[Chorus: Black Rob]\nCan I live, no one man can stop me\nCan I live, no front-line can block me\nCan I live, or do I gotta bring it to these kids\nCan I live, if I don't live nobody live\nCan I live, no one man can stop me\nCan I live, no front-line can block me"}], "artist": "Black Rob"}
