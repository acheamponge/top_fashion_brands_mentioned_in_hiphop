I had this beat stuck in my head\nJust no matter what I could never get it out\nI guess when you're young, you can be anything you wanna choose\n\n[A$AP Rocky in the scene with a kid asking for an autograph]\nHey kid you want an autograph?\nCool? Gimme down!\n\n[A$AP Rocky]\nBut as you get older all of those options start to narrow\nAnd before you know it every choice you made comes with a consequence\nAnd whenever shit got rough... this beat was always there\nBut one day man... it just stopped\nMy brother moved on but...\nBeat came back, passing through every vein in my body\nYou know, my older brother Ricky\nIs responsible for me growin' up and having a real job\n\n[Ricky]\nCom'on Rocky! Just go for it! Just rap!\n\n[Crowd]\nA$AP, A$AP, A$AP...!!!", "year": "2017-03-06"}]}
