Everybody knows that crackers bought crack to our habitat\nTo attack the Latins and Blacks, never mind that fact, something I know is wrong\nYou was there when my hopeless mom put me out in the coldest storm\nEven though you did introduce me to smoking tron\nAnd so it was, you welcome Saigon with open arms\nThat\u2019s all I could focus on, the reason I wrote this explosive song\nTo show even the closest bond, gets torn\nYou tricked me all along, you had me thinking you was my friend\nYou never loved Saigon\n\n[Refrain]\nWith friends like you who needs enemies\nBrought a nigga bad luck like the Kennedys\nYou had a nigga ass up in the penitentiary\nWith friends like you who needs enemies\n\n[Verse 2-Saigon]\nNot only smoking Newport cigs and guzzling whole 40's with one swig\nYou taught the kid more than any school in New York did\nTeachers teaching me social studies, but wasn\u2019t there for Saigon to cry on after the wakes of my closest buddies\nI was grew up, I depicted this picture too up, was I just a fool or just too young\nOr strung on the booze that you brung\nSnatch my soul, put a hole in it, grab my mind took control of it\nMade my heart as cold as the home of the Bolsheviks\nFunny when you wasn\u2019t around it wasn't no incidents\nLet you tell it, all of that was simply coincidence\nThat\u2019s a thesis I doubt, \u2018fore I met you I wasn\u2019t kick Theresas eye out\nOr had the police at my house, I wouldn\u2019t have needed ki's to fly south\nMurder rap would never ease from my mouth, I probably be at peace with myself\nProbably think what you did to me was sweet, laughing at me like Kee-Kee-Kee for falling for your trickery and deceit\nDon\u2019t flatter yourself, it don\u2019t take a genius to spell thug\nConvince a kid at the mere age of twelve to sell drugs\nIf you really had g, you'd have them white kids like you had me\nIt was they great granddaddies that created you Daddy\nThey was the ones that flooded you with gats and liquor stores\nMacs, pimps with the whores, that trade cash for intercourse\nAnd of course these young niggas stay sucking you off\nBut I know the truth, so poof; I\u2019m cutting you off\n\n[Refrain]\nYou did this to me\nYou did this to me, man\nYou know what? A lot of times we grow up thinking the streets is our friend\nYou know what I'm sayin'\nThe streets ain't your motherfucking friend young blood\nTake it from me, man, I been in the streets my whole motherfucking life\nAnd I ain't get nothin' but pain, death, jail...", "album": "The Greatest Story Never Told"}], "artist": "Saigon"}
