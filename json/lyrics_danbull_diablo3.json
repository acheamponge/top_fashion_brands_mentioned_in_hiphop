Hell is more than metaphorical\nIt's down under the town in the cracks, underground like my raps\nNow let me tell you the facts\nYou'll need these to get yourself through the acts\nSo ensure your ears are clear and sound gets through the wax\nI come in one of five flavours at once:\nIf you need speed then you'll favour the Monk\nThe Wizard is a mage, the Demon Hunter's ranged\nThe Barbarian is in a rage at the front\nThe Witch Doctor is the main name for shamanism\nToday's the day you make the fate-changing decision\nMake haste into the prison of the Dark Lords\nWho start wars with us, they'll see we're hardcore\nIf you're struggling with Azmodan, just\nTap my number in and ask for Dan, cause\nIn that conundrum I am the man\nTo leave a demon heaving, gasping\nLike it's asthma, damn, cuz\nI got the master plan\nI GOT THE MASTER PLAN\nI take my scrap to be crafted by an Artisan\nThe improvement of loot is essential\nWith the exception of my weapon - the pencil\nTearing apart skeletal archers like parchment\nGiving your heart a myocardial infarction\nYou'll beg my pardon if I look like an old gnome\nBut I've written whole tomes on the Soulstones\nSo lyrically I'm lethal, all I need is beats\nAnd my speech to defeat the Prime Evil\nWe will succeed cause I'm a wizard\nAnd I run this game like Blizzard (huh-ha)\n[Evil Laughter]", "year": "2012-06-03"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
