That's me!\nRewriting rhyme science, Isaac Clarke\nMy lines shine like eyes in the dark\n\n[Verse 2]\nMines in the vast reaches of deep space\nAre the reason that I came to be in this bleak place\nBut to keep my spirits up I keep lacing the beat\nWith words that deserve a million replays\nTil I beat the game on every difficulty\nPitifully, leaving you amazed, at my skill\nNow could we open the electric doors\nAnd let me get debauched\nWith the Necromorphs\nUntil the Nexus falls\nI bet you've all\nNever seen a pair of balls\nAs heavy as my testicles\n\n[Verse 3]\nI walk the walk, I'm one of the nastiest trash talkers\nAttack Crawlers and Swarmers, blast Stalkers\nI go berserk at Lurkers\nTurn them into burgers\nI murder Pukers\nUse their mucus as a gherkin in a bap\nAmidst the battle I'll be working on my rap\nTo refute your version of the facts\nPlasmatic fluid all curdling\nI'd ask you to call and inform Planet Earth I'm coming back\nTo stack astronomic fees as a music producer\nAnd you? You're stuck at Zero G's, Medusa\nGod Is Dead...Space\nThus Spake Zarathustra", "year": "2013-02-27"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
