Wicked Wiccans I've weakened\nOn weekends we light the wick on the spliff\nAnd split it with demons\nI'm fiending the evening's evil\nThese people whisper their secrets\nI seek written upheavals to burn churches and steeples, yea\n\n[Hook]\nMy mentality\u2019s kill or be\nI hide in my honeycomb\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's not paranoia if you're right clairvoyant inner minds\nSmoke a half kill the nerves stare in voids to feel the high\nI'm a sinner but my center's fine sipping wine with dinner\nIt's divine keep it cheap I'm not the vintage type\nDon't ask again bitch I said I'm fine\nDon't be a witch or you\u2019ll get set on fire, get left to dry\nWhen I exorcise this head of mine\nMy flesh feels like it's petrified\nIdentify their bodies by the teeth now come and testify\n\n[Hook]\nMy mentality\u2019s kill or be\nI hide in my honeycomb\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Bridge]\nMy mentality\u2019s kill or be I hide in my honeycomb\nSurrounded by killer bees so I keep a gun at home\nLike bang stay out of my comfort zone\nYea leave me the fuck alone\n\n[Outro]\nFrom way up here on setting suns\nI hope I fall and that I land on everyone I know\nI hope they die cause so will I\nI\u2019m selfish and I\u2019m small like everyone I know\nI don\u2019t want to go outside today\nI don\u2019t want to have to lie today\nEither way it\u2019s tidal waves I know\nI\u2019ll hideaway I\u2019ll hideaway I\u2019ll hideaway", "album": "Altars"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
