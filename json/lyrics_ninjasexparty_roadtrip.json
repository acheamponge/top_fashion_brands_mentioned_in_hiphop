Woo!\n\n[Chorus]\nLet's hit the road, I was so close to\nPersonal growth, so California here I come\nI wanna bone across the nation\nLet's bust a load of summer fun\n\n[Verse 2]\nI porked most of New York\nI banged 'em silly in Philly\nI had 'em screaming for Balti-more\nI slapped my groin on Des Moines\nAnd dropped my phallus in Dallas\nWe're only halfway through day four\nI gave some C to DC\nBust coconuts on Miami\nI shot puree on Santa Fe\nI gave some Penix to Phoenix\nAnd my nuts rattled Seattle\nSo hard they felt it in L.A\nTake that! Yeah!\n\n[Chorus]\nNow here we are in California\nThese girls are hot and Brian bought us a new yacht\n(He killed the previous owner)\nLet's raise the sail for a gonad-venture\nThis Boner Quest has just begun\n\n[Bridge]\nI left 'em smitten in Britain\nAnd had sex so hard with Lima\nIt landed in Argentina\nThen things got Beejy in Fiji\nI had a four-way in Norway\nAnd started breedin' with Sweden\nNew Zealand got a blast of my semen\nI did some butt stuff with Russians\nUntil they got a concussion\nI banged-ladesh\nNow there's only one way to keep things fresh, cause\n\n[Chorus]\nI've conquered earth, it is time to move on\nLet's take a rocket, find some hot alien sluts\n(Set phasers to thrust)\nNo time for spacesuits, I am way too horny\nLet's show this galaxy what's-\n-HAUUUCCKCKCKK"}], "artist": "Ninja Sex Party"}
