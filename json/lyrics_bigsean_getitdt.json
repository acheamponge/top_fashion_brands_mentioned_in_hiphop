It's money time, nigga!\nYezzir, whoa yeah, hey\n\n[Hook: Pharrell]\nI'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more\nI'm talking Donald Trump level\nI'm trying to get these dreams off the ground\nAll aboard for the shuttle\nAll the hoes!\nThey screaming \"Oh-oh!\nLil nigga go!\nGo for the gold!\"\n\n[Verse 1: Big Sean]\nOkay, \"B-I, B-I\", bitch I do it to death\nIf I come with half, bet I leave with the rest\nOkay, you might be cool getting 50%\nI'm like \"fuck you doing? I need Diddy percent!\"\nGot a million on line 1 and another mil' dialing in\nMomma on line 4, telling me how much not to spend\n'Ye on line 3 telling me how we 'bout to win\nYou on hold tryna get conferenced in\nI ju- I just gotta have it\nImagine and make it happen, I prayed about it and grabbed it\nMy life is a fucking movie, the baddest bitches get casted\nI'm in a race with myself to see who could get it the fastest\nSipping on shit older than me\nThe warmer the weather, the colder the drink\nThe colder the weather, the warmer the mink\nI'm living life like a found a fucking check with no ink\nI get it\n\n[Hook: Pharrell]\nI'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more\nI'm talking Donald Trump level\nI'm trying to get these dreams off the ground\nAll aboard the shuttle\nAll the hoes!\nThey screaming \"Oh-oh!\nLil nigga go!\nGo for the gold!\"\n\n[Post-Hook: Pharrell]\nHey! Get it, get it, nigga we can get it\nGet it, get it, nigga you can get it\nGet it, get it, nigga I can get it\nYea, yea, my nigga we can get it, let's go\n\n[Verse 2: Big Sean]\nWhoa! The sky never seemed so low\nLooking at her like \"you never seemed so close\"\nI had a dream about a trillion in cash\nIt's time to make it happen!\nI'm back to dreaming what you can't imagine\nTalking cash, you gotta fake an accent\nI've broke enough tree down that I could make a cabin\nLook: I turn all my problems to ash\nAll my wants into haves and then divided it by half\nPass it on to my man, write my will out then\nPass it on to my fam and finally become a man\nI had a dream I was greatest of all time\nGreatest of all Bigs, greatest of all Seans\nSipping on shit older than me\nThe warmer the weather, the colder the drink\nThe colder the weather, the warmer the mink\nI'm living life like a found a fucking check with no ink\nI get it\n\n[Hook: Pharrell]\nI'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more\nI'm talking Donald Trump level\nI'm trying to get these dreams off the ground\nAll aboard the shuttle\nAll the hoes!\nThey screaming \"Oh-oh!\nLil nigga go!\nGo for the gold!\"\n\n[Post-Hook: Pharrell]\nHey! Get it, get it, nigga we can get it\nGet it, get it, nigga you can get it\nGet it, get it, nigga I can get it\nYea, yea, my nigga we can get it, let's go"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
