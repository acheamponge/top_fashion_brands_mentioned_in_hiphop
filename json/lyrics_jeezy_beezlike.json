When they found a rat dead\nRight around the corner where us young niggas hustled at\nRight by the stop sign, that's where they was bussin' at\nWhen you come here with nothin', gotta learn how to provide\nCarlo had a Benz 'fore he was old enough to drive\nLosin' 10-20 every night, gamblin' ain't nothin'\nNigga got killed takin' up for his cousins\nWhen you knew shit was real? Drop outfit in the feds\nStill 8 years and a nigga shot him dead\nOn the humbug, left him slumped in his car\nEverybody got a day, don't matter who you are\n\n[Hook: Jeezy]\nI been out here grindin' so long\nBut still I had to find my way on my own\nI could tell you what it beez like\nI could tell you what it beez like\nI'm a true hustler, all that I know\nSo I can make it anywhere that I go\nI could tell you what it beez like\nI could tell you what it beez like-like, beez like\n\n[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]\nStove water, heat cold water\nKnew I'd touch a bird when I got my first quarter\nSell water to a well, nigga\nCold nights, cold hearts, tough love\nThat's what it be like in jail, nigga\nMama crying at my visit cause she care for me\nDaughter just had her period, ain't there for her\nKnow how to have a girl you know just gon' hold ya back\nBut the pussy so good you keep goin' back\nHurt when ya main man turned rat\nMake the whole la familia turn hot like that\nAny city, any block, any boulevard\nI survive, no lie, I'm a ghetto boy\nI could tell ya bout the dos and don'ts\nCould make it anywhere I go, so lose I won't\nI can tell ya bout the hard time when ya really need it\nBeen grindin' so long, still had to call Jeezy\n\n[Hook: Jeezy]\nI been out here grindin' so long\nBut still I had to find my way on my own\nI could tell you what it beez like\nI could tell you what it beez like\nI'm a true hustler, all that I know\nSo I can make it anywhere that I go\nI could tell you what it beez like\nI could tell you what it beez like-like, beez like\n\n[Verse 3: Jeezy]\nStraight from the bottom, tryna make it to the top\nWhat the gov'ment don't give you, gotta get it from the block\nFeel like a bad boy cause this shit don't stop\nStreet so dirty, need a muhfuckin' mop, uh oh!\nLil homie, stay focused, handle ya business\nDon't talk to them niggas around you, might be a witness\nDon't tell the dishwasher what you did wit' ya dishes\nDon't tell these snitchin' niggas what you did wit' ya riches\nNiggas is hopin' they see Christmas\nBut, if we just happen to don't, we hope you miss us\nSanta raised all seven them kids, didn't miss a meal\nShe work her fingers right to the bone, didn't miss a bill\nNigga, six for the nine, let's make a deal\nSee, one thing bout countin' this money, it make ya feel\nSee, I used to get 'em right from the source, got 'em direct\nThe same nigga that had a connect, he in the set\n\n[Hook: Jeezy]\nI been out here grindin' so long\nBut still I had to find my way on my own\nI could tell you what it beez like\nI could tell you what it beez like\nI'm a true hustler, all that I know\nSo I can make it anywhere that I go\nI could tell you what it beez like\nI could tell you what it beez like-like, beez like", "album": "Seen It All: The Autobiography", "year": "2014-09-02", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fb1104e7cfc07487792c932abf32acbe.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jeezy"}
