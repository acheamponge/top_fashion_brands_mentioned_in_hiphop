(in town)\nSee it in they face, they was with the get down\nWhats yo number then? Ready? Type!\nShe said I got you, wait its 5-1-0 right?\nYuh, hit me round 12, then she smiles\nLike somethin she want went on sale\n100s make the music you can rock to you can knock to\nLet me roll, that's a big 10-4\nDo you accept the charges\nYes, I will\nThen when you get out\nWe gon' play on still\nBut when you get out you got to chill\nKnock a bitch up in the hills that'll pay your bills\nAnd thats real\n\n[Hook]\nI'll ride with ya, I'll ride with ya but to\nSlide on ya, its just me n my niggas\n(slide on ya)\n\nRing,ring,who is this?\nRing,ring,hello (hello)\nWhere I'm at?
