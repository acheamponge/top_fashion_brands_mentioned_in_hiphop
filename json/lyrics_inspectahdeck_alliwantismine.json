Come on\n\n[Inspectah Deck]\nI dreamed I was top of the world, watching the world\nAwoke to a room full of smoke, gun at my throat\nI dwell in the heart of the hell, but never fell\nPo'nine scopin' me the whole time, they close behind\nMy wants just as big as my needs, so it's agreed\nTo strap up, tie these shoes, provide the school\nA wild out, had to hide out, in China's house\nThen run free, down to 1G, and hungry\nI won't fold, from the chokehold, I broke molds\nFake ones, fake as they come, waiting to front\nI fight if it cost me my life, toss me the knife\nTo move up, I do what I must, but who to trust\nI came from the grain and remain mentally stained\nThe hardships, starving artist, it's obvious\nI'm 'raging against the machine' to make some CREAM\nThat's how we live, just grab your kids, now we big\nAll up in The Source, we flip and win the toss\nThe law say, lock 'em away, vow to this day\nThe world is ours, we the loud ones at early hours\nStriving, for a new way, my dues are payed\n\n[Hook 2X: Inspectah Deck]\nAll I want is mine..\nAll I want is mine..\nAll I want is mine..\nAll I want is mine..\n\n[Interlude w/ Hook: Inspectah Deck]\nYeah.. I mean, yo, we grinding out here\nWe got our lives on the line\nWe got oddballs watching us\nWe got fucking thieves, crooks, murderers\nGangstas, we got all types of shit we gotta watch out for\nLet alone, your right hand man'll send shots to wet you, son\nShit..\n\n[Inspectah Deck]\nMy conscience beggin' me chills, steady we build\nI ask, is it back to the cracks after the raps\nWhere I'm from, used to be fun, soon'll become\nA deathtrap, mental setback, forget that\nI'mma do this, for that all I am, call out a man\nBlack like Sidney Portier, boy, beware\nThe future's now, my superpowers could move the crowd\nThe road I follow, so far to go to see tomorrow\nI'm close to the edge, my folks are mislead\nSome, lose a step, lyric clueless, they choosin' death\nThat's the wrong vibe, the strong survive, known as they strive\nNow watch me, top of the key, dropping a three\nIn my fate, the biography state, I would be great\nFor now, I milk the cow, build it from the ground\nMore or less, continue conquest hard as it gets\nThe promised land, ain't promised to a honest man\nSo, right or wrong, I'm fighting on this life long\nNow let me live, set for my wiz and seven kids\nI hit the block focus like Mr. Spock\nAnd whether, rhymes or crimes, all I want is mines\n\n[Hook 2X]\n\n[Outro: Inspectah Deck]\nAll I want is mines, what they expect us to do?\nThey taking programs to a channel, man\nYou gotta pay to be locked up, you ain't getting no jobs\nNiggas got three/four kids, four or five baby moms\nNo crib, living out they cars and shit\nI got to get mines... then ain't no stopping\nI'mma do what I gotta do, and I'mma rep for my set\nMy nigga Case rest in peace, my nigga, I'mma see you\nThe'll never take me alive, the'll never take me alive..", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b594b451e76ffa06266ec5bb5611cfd9.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "The Resident Patient", "year": null}]}
