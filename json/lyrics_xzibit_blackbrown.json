That\u2019s why we have to sit down\nAnd speak about the black and the brown\nNow I didn\u2019t come here to point no fingers\nI know over the years that the pain still lingers over past confrontations\nShit we all on parole and probation and fucked up situations\nAnd everybody lose.. from the pen, to the neighborhoods, now it\u2019s even the high schools\n'Cause I was watchin K. Cal News\nWhen the students squared off and one kid wouldn\u2019t choose sides\nHit with a hammer and the kid died and now it\u2019s a full blown riot\nTck, that\u2019s when the fists start flyin\nThese kids ain\u2019t learnin shit about math and science\nMan..\nTension is so thick, some are comin around\nI don\u2019t wanna see no more of us up under the ground\nSo now.. that\u2019s why we need to sit down\nAnd talk about the black and the brown\nEighty percent of inmates are black and hispanic\nThey tryna wipe us all off the face of this planet\nDammit.. that\u2019s why we need to sit down\nAnd talk about the black and the brown\nYo, I got the homey Jose from way back in the day\nHe came to scoop me up in his all white Six-Trey\nAnd he don\u2019t really fuck with nobody outside of the set\nIt\u2019s tatted big on his neck\nY'know? So over the years, built respect and trust\nSome black and brown issues we both discussed\nHe said, \u201cHomes, it\u2019s been goin down too long\nI gotta bang on them fools and it don\u2019t feel wrong\"\n\"They killed my cousin over eighty eight bricks\nSo word came down, we gotta handle that shit\"\n\"Kill all mayatas in white tee shirts\nCan I tell the truth homes? The truth starts hurtin\"\nAt first, I remind him of what vengeance do\nWhat vengeance is and who vengeance belongs to\nHe wasn\u2019t tryna hear that shit\nHe just turned up the volume, bangin 50 Cent\nTension is so thick, some are comin around\nI don\u2019t wanna see no more of us up under the ground\nSo now.. that\u2019s why we need to sit down\nAnd talk about the black and the brown\nEighty percent of inmates are black and hispanic\nThey tryna wipe us all off the face of this planet\nDammit.. that\u2019s why we need to sit down\nAnd talk about the black and the brown\nI got soldiers from both sides who really don\u2019t care\nWho identify themselves by the colors they wear\nThe homey came through to put one in the air\nI can tell somethin was wrong the way he sat in his chair\nHe said, \u201cX, man I\u2019m just gettin out\nFrom doin eighty eight months, tryna figure things out\"\nHe told me in the pen you get down to get done\n\u2018Cause the brown and black ratio is five to one\nHe showed me the scar on his gut and his neck\nThey got him good, said he damn near bled to death\nThe hate was do deep, I can see in his eyes\nWhen he described what it feels like to almost die\nAll I could do was just sit back and listen\n'Bout how he 'bout to send soldiers on missions\nI got hit with a bottle but I\u2019m not dead\nI said, \"Think with your heart homey, not your head\"\nI said..\nTension is so thick, some are comin around\nI don\u2019t wanna see no more of us up under the ground\nSo now.. that\u2019s why we need to sit down\nAnd talk about the black and the brown\nEighty percent of inmates are black and hispanic\nThey tryna wipe us all off the face of this planet\nDammit.. that\u2019s why we need to sit down\nAnd talk about the black and the brown\n[Jelly Roll]\nOooooh you must defend yourself (Yeah!)\nIf you don\u2019t, then no one else (Nobody!)\nYour homies got to ride (Let\u2019s go!)\nYou\u2019re fighting for your life (Yeah!)\nThey want both of us dead\nYou ain\u2019t heard a word I said\nYou\u2019re fighting for your life (Come on)\nYour homies got to ride\nTension is so thick, some are comin around\nI don\u2019t wanna see no more of us up under the ground\nSo now.. that\u2019s why we need to sit down\nAnd talk about the black and the brown\nEighty percent of inmates are black and hispanic\nThey tryna wipe us all off the face of this planet\nDammit.. that\u2019s why we need to sit down\nAnd talk about the black and the brown"}], "artist": "Xzibit"}
