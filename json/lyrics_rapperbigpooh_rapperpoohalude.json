Ab-Soul, Kendrick Lamar\n[Rapper Big Pooh]\nFair warning, people would have never had a problem\nIf the naysayers or the doubters would have got him\nSlumped if the corner, for sure I'm a goner\nShoot with no aim, so them niggas couldn't spot him\nNow I got a question, if I really even want it\nWhen this shit is like a trip through the city of Sodom\nGomorrah, the horror, stories are endless\nWorkshop, working all night, no apprentice\nFunny when a nigga speak truth he a menace\nUshered in the underground, lifelong sentence\nThere's where I dwell, ain't no need to cry for me\nRapper gonna eat, and I eat well\nIt's been six years since I stepped out the shell\nTalent on the rise to the top, I propel\nBig Dho set sail, your boy gon' win\nBet niggas act crazy when they see us again\nI'm really going in, I've been had nothing to lose\nSo I choose to take y'all through a spin\nA journey through the mind of a sane ass artist\nIf you spitting blah-blah shit, you a target\nIf you spitting blah-blah shit, then just forfeit\nWhat go around come around, now they all on my dick\n[Kendrick Lamar]\nKendrick Lamar, I'm bout to get my mop stick\nNiggas bump their gums, and their bitches be bumping my shit\nI fry your optics, if you watching my style, watch it\nTyrannosaurus reading a thesaurus, hold rappers hostage\nCatastrophic, it's 9-11 when I'm repping\nSkip college to fly first class, learn a lesson\nStraight brutal, roman numerals\nNumber one eating Ramen noodles, rhyming crucial under the sun\nKudos to the most high, which is me\nI probably make 'em plan their suicide, so usually\nI ain't never been with the shit starting, but y'all done started some shit\nI'm bout to drink some ex-lax then commence\nTo returning the favor to all of my neighbors and comrades\nCalm down, you more like Trina than Trinidad at spots now\nThrow your dubs up\nPussy probably holding Daisy Dukes and C-cups\nI look inside this industry and I don't see much\nI just see lunch, and your shit that's more bore like tourists\nI'm laid back, got feet up, how cool is that?\nThe twenty-ten Kool G. Rap, whenever I rap\nI got my arsenal stuck on my back, I'm ready for war\nThey tend to look for me when they fiend for Afeni Shakur\nConversing, not hibernating, under the planet core\nAt thirteen I cancelled PG-13 and went for gore\nThat's what I pledge\nIt's profound that I'm underground touching 'mainstreams' like river beds\n[Ab-Soul]\nYeah, (Ab-Soul) they saying he a breath of fresh air (light?)\nThey can't smell all this weed that I brought in here\nBlack & Mild smoke still linger on my clothes\nSo unprofessional, I shouldn't be meeting with millionaires\nPull up a chair, I'll school you to it\nI was a student truant that never studied, just always knew it\nYou just new to it, with no clue on how you should do it\nLike youth in junior high school when puberty's looming\nAnd mind you, I never mined you, I ain't digging for gold\nHonestly, I just want to stick my dick in some hoes\nKick a flow, hit the 'dro with my bros\nTippy-toe in this rap game, make a lil' name\nWith this lil' lane I've been paving since I was a teen\nThat I never really thought that I would attain\nWhen Big Pooh dropped 'Sleepers' I could barely get a feature\nThey ain't know this regular nigga would be the future\nI've viewed the roof from the floor, I've been here before\nI'm finna blow a couple of times over like two tubas\nAnd I'ma still want more with this appetite\nTill the critics stop giving me mixed signals like traffic lights\nYou know? The lavish life, but for now I'm the new Kunta\nSlave to my rhyme book, a line of mine, your time's up\nThe bastard kissing your bitch with the blackened suit coolers\nShe'll testify, excuse Judas when I'm crucified"}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
