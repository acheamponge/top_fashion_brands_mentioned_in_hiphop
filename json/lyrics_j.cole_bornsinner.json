Cole]\nYeah\nHey\n\n[Verse 1: J. Cole]\nSpinning in circles, live my life without rehearsal\nIf I died today my nigga, was it business, was it personal?\nShould this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful\nNever got to church to worship lord but please be merciful\nYou made me versatile, well-rounded like cursive\nKnow you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses\nBorn sinner, was never born to be perfect\nSucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses\nBack when we ran the streets who would think we'd grow to be murderers\nTeachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless\nAnd violent, and hopeless, I saw but never noticed\nThat a college point us right to \"Be all that you can be\" posters, uh\nRest in peace to Tiffany, I don't know if\nThis the realest shit I wrote, but know the realest nigga wrote this\nAnd signed it, and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day you'll find it\nAnd knew one day you'd come back and rewind it, singing\n\n[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]\nI'm a born sinner\nBut I'll die better than that, I swear\nYou were always where I needed you to be\nWhether you were there or not there (I was there)\nI was born sinning\nBut I live better than that (better than that)\nIf you ain't fucking with that, I don't care\n(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: J. Cole]\nYeah, this music shit is a gift\nBut God help us make it 'cause this music bizz is a cliff\nI got her life in my grip, she holding tight to my wrist\nShe screaming: \"Don't let me slip\"\nShe see the tears in my eyes, I see the fear on her lips\nTrue when I told you: \"You the only reason why I don't flip\nAnd go insane\"; My roof in the pouring rain\nYou knew me before the fame, don't lose me the more I change, no\nJust grow with me, go broke you go broke with me\nI smoke you gon' smoke with me\nWoman's curse since birth, man lead her to the hearse\nI go Bobby you go Whitney damn\nListen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears\nYou the only one who knows 'em\nDon't you ever go expose 'em\nThis life is harder than you'll probably ever know\nEmotions I hardly ever show, more for you than for me\nDon't you worry yourself, I gotta do this for me\nThey tell me life is a test, but where's the tutor for me?\nPops came late, I'm already stuck in my ways\nDucking calls from my mother for days\nSometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised\nCan't wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say\nExcept\n\n[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]\nI'm a born sinner\nBut I'll die better than that, I swear\nYou were always where I needed you to be\nWhether you were there or not there (I was there)\nI was born sinning\nBut I live better than that (better than that)\nIf you ain't fucking with that, I don't care\n(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Chorus: Choir]\nI'm a born sinner\nBut I'll die better than that, I swear\nYou were always where I needed you to be\nWhether you were there or not there (I was there)\nI was born sinning\nBut I live better than that (better than that)\nIf you ain't fucking with that, I don't care\n(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Outro: J. Cole]\nThis shit is a gift"}], "artist": "J. Cole"}
