Put my trust in the lust of a dream that you wanted\n\n[Hook]\n\nThe witness, the witness, is unjust\n(Well there goes my fuckin' trust)\nA surface, the purpose, contentious\n(Well there goes my fuckin' trust)\nThe witness, the witness, is unjust\n(Well there goes my fuckin' trust.)\n\nDug a hole into my garden, took a piece of every root that I started\nCause' I wasn't guarded, cause I wasn't guarded\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nYou knew everything about this train\nThese wheels have never been on a track\nYou took my hand and led me down your path\n\nIts gone too far to start turnin' back\nYou tryna' say we better than that\n\nWhen the ink went dry with that pen I signed\nYou stabbed it in my back\n\nSick to the stomach, and im sick to the brain\nYou got a piece of every single word I say\n\nBut baby whos to blame?, I bought into the game\nNow you got all to gain\n\n[Hook]\n\nThis ones for you, the vine with the\nThis ones for you, the vine with the\nThis ones for you, the vine with the thorns\n\nAnd now my gardens all yours\nAnd now my gardens all yours"}], "artist": "Kat Dahlia"}
