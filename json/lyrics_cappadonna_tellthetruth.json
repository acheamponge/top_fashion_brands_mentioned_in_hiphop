Lazy Bone]\nI'm praying on my mamma, on my grandma Imma live more\nI swear to keep it real -?????????????\n(until I'm dead and gone)\nImma represent the struggle\nAnd Imma stay humble so until everybody rumble\nBut you gotta hustle\nImma keep it hood 'til the day I die\nAn I'll make sure it's understood that I never lie\nI never make a deal with the devil and exchange for my soul\nThe vanity, the sanity for fang that I know\nThey get blind by the bright light, sold by the fast cars\nLost in the night life, burned by the bad girl\n(Ain't this material world, such an infurious world?)\nBut everybody wanna live it\nAnd they don't really care what they got to give up to get it\nThe industry's infested with this evil with this spirit\nThat's why this song on radio you'll probably never hear it\nBut I still spit the real\n\n[Chorus: Jay Rush]\nI swear to tell the truth\nI swear to never lie\nI swore to keep it hood until the day I die\nThe praying that I fail\nThe praying that I fall\nBut you can pray all you want it ain't no help for ya'll\nI hope I hope I hope I hope\nI pray I pray I pray I pray\nThat heaven's got a ghetto and waiting for me\nI hope I hope I hope I hope\nI pray I pray I pray I pray\nThat heaven's got a ghetto and waiting for me\n\n[Verse 2: Cappadonna]\nYo, Imma keep it real with you\nYou ain't building with me then I can't chill with you\nMy mind is on getting that family right\nThe industry don't care about your family life\nI pray to God that we always keep the family tight\nTell the truth never sellin' out for the loop\nNever lie but I still wanna get high\nSo hooded with it that's how we getting' by\nYea, and this deceptional world I'm an exceptional pearl\nI'm always gonna be street, I always live what I speak\nAnd I ain't sayin' that I'm perfect\nBut wickedness can't defeat my spiritual purpose\nI'm in a God, yo my soul ain't for purchase\nHoping that I pray that everything was worth it\n\n[Chorus: Jay Rush]\nI swear to tell the truth\nI swear to never lie\nI swore to keep it hood until the day I die\nThe praying that I fail\nThe praying that I fall\nBut you can pray all you want it ain't no help for ya'll\nI hope I hope I hope I hope\nI pray I pray I pray I pray\nThat heaven's got a ghetto and waiting for me\nI hope I hope I hope I hope\nI pray I pray I pray I pray\nThat heaven's got a ghetto and waiting for me"}]}
