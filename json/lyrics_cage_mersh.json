I can't change the channel!\nEvery day try and kill it, but there's no ammo!\nAnd television heads is feds that wanna hurt you\nI found a way out, but ain't nowhere to merc' to\nThis world's a commercial! I can't change the channel!\nEvery day try and kill it, but there's no ammo!\nAnd television heads is feds that wanna hurt you\nI found a way out, but ain't nowhere to merc' to\n\nIn flesh I stress the day-to-day vision\nThrew on a condom\nNow I'm sponsored by Trojan\nWalking Polo ad, rap fad MTV\nGrab every face of the nation\nThrough optical examination\nFeedin ya bleedin ya through media brain leavin' ya\nTouch the magazine and it seep in ya\nSo I train on Playstation in army apparel and\nGet lost in the TV world like Carol Ann\nScan my finger for the credit\nMiscountin' dough? Forget it\nThere's a pale white horse in town and everybody fed it\nSky's black, my eyes crack, I think I'm 'sleep\nI cleanse my thoughts with courtships of leak'\n\n[Hook]\nThis world's a commercial! I can't change the channel!\nEvery day try and kill it, but there's no ammo!\nAnd television heads is feds that wanna hurt you\nI found a way out, but ain't nowhere to merc' to\nThis world's a commercial! I can't change the channel!\nEvery day try and kill it, but there's no ammo!\nAnd television heads is feds that wanna hurt you\nI found a way out, but ain't nowhere to merc' to"}]}
