Erica Thompson\n[Erica Thompson]\n(Ohh-ohh-ohhhhh) Normally, I kept it to myself\nBut seeing you, the stronger I felt\nYou wanted to take me off my ground\nAnd I didn't make a sound\nAnd everytime I would come around\nIt was you tryin to bring me down\nSo my problem now is you\n\n[Chorus: Erica Thompson]\nI kept my cool, put up with you\nBut you won't see, that I won't keep\nHolding back, holding back, holding back\nAll the time that I didn't react, now I'm not holding back\n\n[Rapper Big Pooh]\nMuh'fucker best learn your lane\nWatch your mouth, do both, this they year it change\nHear people shoutin out who all strange\nNow he talkin all tough like he joined a gang\nNaw, nigga, I'm the same ol' G\nAsk Po, ask Joc, homie they know me\nAnd since he got here Rapper been low key\nBeen provoked by them folk out throwin debris\nYou see 'em, standing in the mausoleum\nOf hate, your boss mad the reports is late\nWanna talk about numbers, nigga they all fake\nHow you call yourself a shark when you swim in the lake?\nWatch your son shine, kinda hard to take\nGo cry in your car when it's time for break\nWhile you workin overtime, Dho workin your mate\nKnow your future look bleak, but i'm raisin my rate, holla~!\n\n[Chorus]"}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
