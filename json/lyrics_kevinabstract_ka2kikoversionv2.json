Not at all\nStanding still, I feel the fall coming\nStaring in the mirror, tell myself that I don't mean nothing\nMy vision blurry as ever, my wrist is bloody as ever\n3 A.M., still in the apartment\u2019s parking lot\nMy sister go to work in two hours, I go to school in three\nI still ride the school bus, still ain't got no state ID\nPitty for me? Nah, nigga not at all\nTuition fees? Nigga please, finna be Bieber in the fall, motherfucker\n\n[Bridge:]\nBetter protect your head boy, better watch what you said boy\nBefore you end up dead boy, is what a wise man once said boy\n\n[Verse 2:]\nFuck twelve, fuck twelve, nigga\nRolling up until I feel different\nRun through thots until my feelings missing\nYou moving weight from your momma's kitchen\nAin't shit change, got no range though\nStill the same nigga, different area code\nKeep the same circle everywhere I go\nIf shit gon' pop off, you know how it go\nNigga, you know how it go"}], "artist": "Kevin Abstract"}
