Fad hit\nSupersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts\nOr, to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses\nOf hoochies, had poison airbrushes on they asses\nDudes, had on Nike suits, and the Pumas with\nThe fat laces, cuz it was either that or K-Swiss\nI miss those days, and so I pout like a grown jerk\nWishin all I had to do now, was finish homework\nIt's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone\nAnd I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but\nSometimes I do sit and reminesce then\nThink about the years I was raised, back in the days\n\nChorus: repeat 2X\n\nVerse Three:\nNiggerole, I figure that now I'm all grown up\nBecause I'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say I'm holdin\nDown a steady job and crew steady mobbin\nYou steady bobbin your head and I'm paid, so I got it made\nBut, didn't always have clout, used to live in South Central L.A\nThat's where I stayed and figured a way out\nI gave it all I had so for what it's worth\nI went, from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first\nSo (Ahmad and The Jones' is on our way up)\nYup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid\nAnd we finally did, but\nSometimes I still sit and reminesce, then\nThink about the years I was raised, back in the days\n\nChorus: repeat 5X until fades\n(and everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(and everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(and everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(what?) (back in the day) (when?) (back in the day)\n(and everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(and everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(and everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(what?) (back in the day) (when?) (back in the day)\n(and everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(and everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(and everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(what?)
