Hey look, go for it\nYour lyrics are old school, prehistoric\nAncient, corroded and busted\nGreasy and dirty and full of combustion\nWhat a flop, what a pity, what a waste of time\nYou want def rhymes? Here's a taste of mine\nLyrics I write contain a hard, def style\nYours are soft and moist, made out of textile\n( ? ), put em in the double x file\nOf wack rappers, they gotta exiled\nCall me an undertaker, I use my mic like a guillotine\nTake 10 seconds to find out what killer mean\nThere's always a sucker in the crowd that'll spill the beans\nSo just bodybag him and ship him to the Philippines\nMission accomplished like I promised\nYou're on a wack staff, I got the last laugh\nI'm cold serious, nothin to smile for\nYou gotta brace yourself for the style wars\n\n[Hook]\nCause these are the style wars\nDJ Cee Just\n(We are ready to go to war - now)\n\nAh yeah, Flavor Unit in effect\n1990, small things behind me\nRighteous Force Productions in effect\nYou know what I'm sayin\nCold rippin off necks\n\nAnd I'm outta here\nWe in effect, y'all\nPeace"}], "artist": "Lakim Shabazz"}
