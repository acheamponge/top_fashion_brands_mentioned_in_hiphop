Just another guy stuck in desperation\nLookin' at the ceilin' fan, spinnin' around, havin' a panic attack\nI don't pop no pills 'cause it don't take the pain away from me\nI don't crack no seals 'cause it done took the gang away from me\nI been known to pimp a ho, got dirty loafers on my feet\nBitch you got me mesmerized, them thighs the size of me\nLemme slide inside your body beef, bitch\nI got my chain on, ain't a thing wrong with a broken frozen wrist\nBitch, bitch\n\n[Chorus: Pouya]\nThem suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away\nAnother day I piss away, another day don't go my way\nAnother ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase\nBut bitch I'm not the one, so get your comfort from another\nThem suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away\nAnother day I piss away, another day don't go my way\nAnother ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase\nBut bitch I'm not the one, so get your comfort from another\n\n[Verse 2: Pouya]\nEverything I did is crumblin' beneath my feet\nI'm feelin' lonely, feelin' like I'm only stuck with memories\nTake me back to what I was, take away what I've become\nTake away the grayer days, take the bullet out my brain\nTake my dick out your mouth and let me be myself\nI wonder what the people around me think about me\nBack to my shady ways I go\nPack the Gat and let it blow\nJust let my lover, brother, mother, sisters, father know I love 'em\nMikey, I told you we was gon be somethin'\nLook at us now 'cause now we buzzin', pressin' buttons\nDiamonds dancin' by the dozen\nNick, I told you we would rise from nothin'\nLook at the way they look at me now\nRich forever, blowin' money 'til I'm senile\n\n[Chorus: Pouya]\nThem suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away\nAnother day I piss away, another day don't go my way\nAnother ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase\nBut bitch I'm not the one, so get your comfort from another\nThem suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away\nAnother day I piss away, another day don't go my way\nAnother ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase\nBut bitch I'm not the one, so get your comfort from another\n\n[Verse 3: Pouya]\nI got addicted to the money as I fell inside a hole\nThe cries and crowd get louder, the deeper that I go\nNobody know what I've been doin', tell myself I hate myself\nI can't control the cards I'm dealt\nI spent a lot of time alone inside my room\nThinkin' about what I would do if I knew you was on the fence about me too, bitch\nI crashed the whip and hit a bitch, and almost killed the bitch\nAn now I'm back in the Cadillac with that black pistol grip\nThe AC don't work and I'm feelin' like I was a kid again\nFeelin' like I wasn't gettin' in with the cooler kids\nHow the fuck can I get out of this funk?\nIf I die, you cry, then move on, the next day\nI'm ill-advised, fuck you, bitch, you can't even look me in my eyes\n\n[Chorus: Pouya]\nThem suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away\nAnother day I piss away, another day don't go my way\nAnother ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase\nBut bitch I'm not the one, so get your comfort from another\nThem suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away\nAnother day I piss away, another day don't go my way\nAnother ho gon' look my way, lookin' for a paper chase\nBut bitch I'm not the one, so get your comfort from another\nThem suicidal thoughts inside the Cadillac won't fade away\nFade away, fade away", "year": "2017-12-11"}]}
