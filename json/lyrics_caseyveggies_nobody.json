Get a new chain but stay with the same hustle\nYou say you love me but I can\u2019t trust you. Man this game ugly\nI stay high just tryna stay above it\nI\u2019m in the streets just tryna stay in touch with\nEverything that I grew up with. That\u2019s how I make my money\nYoung nigga's on the rise and you can\u2019t take it from me\nAnd I put that on me, keep my circle nice and small I gotta couple homies\nThat\u2019s on my day to day. I know a lot of people but I just stay away\nCause ain\u2019t none of them gon' get me paid\nI try to talk to god I\u2019m tryna pray, but I just don\u2019t know what to say\nIn life, you just gotta find your way\nWatch your back nigga and guard yo face, in hopes that one day...\n\n\n[Hook]\nLife changes, things don't stay the same\nLife changes, things don't stay the same\nLife changes, things don't stay the same\nLife changes, Life changes\n\nVerse 2/\nIt\u2019s so hard to keep a clear mind dealing with life\u2019s field mines\nShit blow up once you think it\u2019s all fine\nBut Ima keep on trying, like my grandma did\nBeen in that nursing home for ten long years\nBut she forever gone stay right here, that\u2019s in my heart\nI get attached to everything I start\nAnd resort to action when it\u2019s time to win, cause I don\u2019t wanna end\nGirl, I don\u2019t want nothing if I can\u2019t have it all\nNot insecure, that\u2019s just how I was taught\nYou moving on? That\u2019s what I never thought\nIn this life I just need some love, only something true\nI guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m tryna fuck with you. Don\u2019t wanna be alone\nDon\u2019t wanna argue just wanna get along\nNot in the mood, I don\u2019t answer phones\nJust need some time i\u2019m tryna free my dome\nGirl come over let\u2019s get it on, and watch me never stop\nTo make up for all them other times...\n\n[Hook]\nLife changes, things don't stay the same\nLife changes, things don't stay the same\nLife changes, things don't stay the same\nLife changes, Life changes, Life changes\nLife"}]}
