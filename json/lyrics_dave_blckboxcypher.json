if I died today\nWould you put some shells in a nine and go and ride for me?\nBrother would you ride for me?\nCause brother I would ride for you\nI'd load up a nine for you or sit and do life for you\nBrother would you look after my wifey, If I touched the cells\nOr would you go behind my back, betray me and fuck my girl\nBrother would you smile when I'm up and let me share it with you or would you take it in my sleep\nBrother here's the Issue\nI never came from a broken home, the system came and broke my home\nAnd now my bro's are sitting in cells like chromosomes\nI hope the dough don't tear us apart, but I know the roads\nI know my bro's got love for me, I love them back, I know the code\nWould you chat to my mum and see if she's ....\nListen man\nLook lemme go back\nLittle tingz, little tingz\nIt's just a warm up\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo\nListen\nDave\nLook\nReal stuff\nLook\nTried and tested\nMy lifestyle's reckless\nIn and out, I'm stressed\nShit\nI write till my head spins\nLiving in a squalor for a while, this isn't nice bruv\nScales, sizer, visits with lifers\nI don't care bout your lifes bruv\nYour packs or your Lycas\nI've been licking out squares and missing every fucking time bruv\nLifestyle stressful\nYeah sometimes I cry\nMy mum makes that face and bruv I see it in her eyes and I breakdown\nBut you ain't ever had a breakdown\nDriving to Cookham Wood in a whip and it breaks down\nAnd you're stressing in the visit cause your brother's running late now\nYou ain't never felt numb and seen your older brother's face in a paper\nAnd you're looking at your mum and she's lifeless\nI had to phone Juss\nReal shit, on my mums\nAll the phone calls I made for the funds\nI was never on my ones\nI had the realest from the jump\nAre you fucking mad!\nBare niggas change and man I used to rate\nStuck in the same place\nSelling draws or eighths\nI put four on your place\nIf you war with my mates\nI put p's in your back, put corn on your plate\nCat D, Cat P, Cat A\nIt's a myth bruv\nI've lived this\nCookham, Elmley, Feltham, Swinford, Wandsworth, Tempside, Highdown, Brixton, Ford\nMy brothers getting bored\nMy mother still poor\nMy money feel short\nAll the Prada that I bought\nA quick fix, I'm distraught\nDying in designer, I need slow money quick\nI should've bought a nine bar and fed the whole fucking strip\nBut I didn't\nI was concerned with all these bitches tryna Twitter me\nGirls never made me a penny\nI swear brother it's killing me\nAnd now they wanna talk like all these girls are getting into me\nI fuck her three times cause she ain't never seen a trilogy (trilla g)\nI'm from a land where niggas lick and trap\nAnd all the flyest niggas probably got the thinnest stack\nAnd all the broke niggas still broke\nTaking pics with racks to them ears, them niggas actually queer\nAnd yeah niggas do die\nSo I'll run if they back the strap\nHand in hand\nMy moneys in cards like match attax\nHow I [?]\nI'm fucking confused\nI'm struggling to keep up with man who got nothing to lose\nI can't shank man and go jail\nI got way too much potential\nBut I'm facing niggas that will that'll sccrrrrrr up in a rental\nCause they wanna go jail\nYeah, they need ratings\nNo future\nIt's frustrating\nSo how I draw hate\nBruv I'm fucking confused\nMy brother still writing to me\nI dropped tears on that letter\nPS G do what ever ma say\nYou got something to lose\nBut nothing to prove\nAnd that's the realest rap that I ever fucking wrote\nI can demonstrate broke\nI need digits in my world\nI had bailiffs waiting like I was picking up my girl\nNo talking in the station, real niggas never tell\nNah\nThem niggas onto us\nThem pussies follow us\nBlade brown disciples\nBragging bout who buys fools\nI hate it\nI hate my own name shit\nCause when it comes on, I never like what David (Dave did)\nStill I put the base in balls like Babe Ruth\nNiggas call me Blackbox like an oldschool game cube\nBack for the cypher\n40k on my Blackbox\nFeeling like a hero, in my college I was Hancock\nBut I'm cool\nI don't need all the views\nJust a few real niggas and my brothers out them fucking prisons\nThem dickheads don't believe me\nThis rap scene needs me\nMy teachers weren't surprised, they said this music ting was easy\nFrom when I spoke about my dad and Ms Wiles used to cry\nI put my soul in my rhymes, I never do this for the hype\nListen\nMandem\n\n[Verse 3]\nBeen trying make you see what I can\nIt's talking to the death, describing colour to a blind man\nI was putting hundreds in my cupboards, it was light fam\nMan forget I'm 16, brother I'm still nice fam\nI was talking grands from a yungen\nHad plans from a yungen\nScreaming RIP Gran from a yungen\nI never had a penny for a patty or a dumpling\nI was chasing catties, chasing patties for a pumpin'\nI was just a brace face, Dave never had a name to him\nWe had a skatty little spinner and it never had a name to it\nNow everybody's got rambos and jangos\nBlade pushing fruitys\nNow brudda watch your man go\nBlade pushing fruitys\nNow brudda watch your man go\nGloves for them spinners, that was Kangol\nI was 15, I never banged goals\nI banged visits like lawyers\nMy brother said see ya and I wanted a tom like Sawyer\nMy teacher was a MILF, so that pain was getting milked like soya\nIn between sticks like Neuer\nSitting in a cell, in a piccolo for the mula\nI used to go ham like mula\nI used to go ham like Goku's son\nAnd now my brothers in the can with the ob1\nBoth my brothers missing, I'm the only son\nSometimes I sit and think that I'm the chosen one\nWhizzing on the M1\nFuck you and your dead gun\nMost my niggas shooting like all your niggas can get some", "year": "2015-10-05"}], "artist": "Dave"}
