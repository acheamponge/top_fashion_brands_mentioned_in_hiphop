They say he was mad about his murder in his own particular way. See as a child he had no friends so only with the birds he would play. He grew with them as they grew with he. What a wonderful bird one day they would be. Together like feathers on wings out stretched waiting, watching. which victim is next? As the corn fields rustle and the rose then part. Rest assure that the scarecrow is coming for your heart. Your eyes are for his crows he says it gives them sight. Then your head becomes a Jack-o'-lantern forever carved in fright. Be careful my friends for he knows you are close and if he has his way he'll have your life and your ghost.
