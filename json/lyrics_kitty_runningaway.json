We\nSpeed by, yellow, red, and green light\nMorning\u2019s comin', and I\u2019ll be runnin'\nRunning away\nRunning, running away\nI'll be running, running away\nRunning, running away\nRunning, running away\n\n[Verse 2]\nLosing track of all the miles in an hour\nMoving fast, so I try to keep it down\nI been listening to every little sound\nWhen you whisper to me, I remember how\n\n[Chorus]\nSpeed by streetlights, tell me you adore me\nCan you breathe right, and are you sure? We\nSpeed by, yellow, red, and green light\nMorning\u2019s comin', and I\u2019ll be runnin'\nRunning away\nRunning, running away\nI'll be running, running away\nRunning, running away\nRunning, running away"}]}
