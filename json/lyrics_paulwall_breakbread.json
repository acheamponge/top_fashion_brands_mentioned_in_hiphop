Ford\nCause my diamonds, average bout 15 points\nAll my T.V. VS, nothing less than the best\nSo I guess, that means I got expensive breath\nBut I'm more than just jewelry, I'm more than just ice\nBut me looking like a scrub, just wouldn't safice\nI got rolls gold glowing, lap tops showing\nBremie Louis the Thirteenth, to keep it flowing\nI can keep going and going, but what's the use\nYou know I'm balling in the mix, cause I got the juice\nI run with wise guys, so it's no surprise\nEverywhere I go, women undress me with they eyes\nBoys can't knock it, I'm on the rise like a rocket\nBig bank take lil' bank, I let you pick which pocket\nMy wrist glowing, like I stuck my hand in a socket\nIt's Paul Wall can't nobody stop it, break bread\n\n[Hook - 2x]\n\n[Lew Hawk]\nI'm a star stunning nigga, when I step in the club\nChannel sets cross my wrist, just like a light bulb\nGot Gucci cross my feet, while I shock and rock\nPopping Crystal bottles, will make these hoes bop\nWe some top notch playas, ain't no time for acting\nWe need ATM machines, for the loot we stacking\nBetter think shoot a fee, I bet it won't break me\nPlus I spend a few G's, up in VIP\nIt's the currency, that make these hoochies hunch\nAll they want is a hour fifty, take em out to lunch\nBut they must be drunk, I never trick off ends\nJust flip a blue Benz, with the blue eyes lens\nOn 16 headed North, with my chrome girlfriend\nShe could make your life end, and not get sent to the Penn\nThis for my niggas in the Penn, that won't see sunshine\nGot princess cuts in my mouth, you could see sunshine, break bread\n\n[Hook - 2x]\n\n[Gu-U]\nJumping in the slab, I'm bound to turn heads\nIn something's blue red, running lights like the FED's\nMan I feel like Pac, it's all eyes on me\nSitting on 23's, in the black SUV\nA life of luxury, that's the life for me\nYou can catch me at the mall, spending 15 thee\nOn the piece and chain, got rocks and rings\nHoes attitudes changed, since I'm having thangs\nIt's hard to explain, but that's the way it goes\nOver night I went from showing rocks, to rocking shows\nHoes that wouldn't speak, now they watching me\nBut I'm trying to figure out, is it the watch or me\nOr the foreign car, with the blue eyed lens\nIt's a bird it's a plane, that's my made back Benz\nIs we cutting or what, is what I'm asking her\nIn Texas she saw my chain, it's a massacre, break bread\n\n[Hook - 2x]", "year": "2004-02-24"}]}
