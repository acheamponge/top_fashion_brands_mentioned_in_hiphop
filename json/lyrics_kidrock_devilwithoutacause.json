I'm in the red cause my mind's distortin'\nPeople claimin' that they know me, but they only know a portion\nI'm gonna move mountains and touch the sun\nDon't get scared now, you knew this day would come\nSo hold your bids, all bets are closed\nAnd fuck all you hoes\nCause it's been a long time comin'\nBut I finally broke like an egg yolk I ain't no joke\nLike some uncut dope motherfucker, Kid Rock's to blame\nSame game, same name, ain't a damn thing changed\nNo sell-out, I ain't no ho, fuck the radio I'm comin' from that R-O-M-E-O\nWatch me throw like a fist of rage\nSelf-made and paid and sawed-off 12 gauges\nUp that ass for the 9-8\nNever fake, shake, straight from the Great Lakes\nSeven years on wax comin' correct\nFlat out you diss me punk, that's when I pull the strap out\nAnd I get to buck-buck-bucking I'm fuck-fuck-fucking your hoes\nCause they know who's runnin' this shit, Top Dog I'm the C-E-O\nRole model, your mother-fucking H-E-R-O\nMy motto, \"Be Cool - Keep Pimpin'.\"\nDon't sleep, we roll deep in a Lincoln\nFour Vogues on a hundred spokes\nWe bust Biltmore Beavers in Top Dog coats\nWe float like butterflies, sting like queen bees\nStrapped with A-K's straight from the Chinese\nWhat the fuck's goin' on in the D\nBunch of white boys pimpin' like the K-I-D\nAnd it's all good I got love for my honkeys\nWe roll thick kick ass like donkeys\nAnybody fuck's with you, I'm gonna mack 'em\n\n[Chorus: Kid Rock]\nDevil without a cause...I'm going platinum\nI'm going Platinum (DEVIL)\nI'm going Platinum (DEVIL)\nWe're going platinum (DEVIL)\nDevil without a cause I'm going platinum\n\n[Interlude]\nYeah we come to party, so get down everybody\nYeah we come to party\n\n[Verse 2: Kid Rock]\nI went from St. Claire shores and drink specials at Winners\nTo New York City and $700 dinners\nFrom hangin' with sinners and second hand cheap sex\nTo gettin' much respect from top record execs\nThe cool Kid's claimin' up to call you out\nSo shut up now or put my balls in your mouth\nBet that ass hoss I ain't forgot\nWhen I was tossed in the dime bin and left to rot\nUsed to call me funny when my nose was fucking runny\nNow my fuckin' bunnies gettin' fuckin' Matchbox 20 money\nMotherfuckers want to claim they're down\nBut when I was broke and down I never seen them around\nAll the shit we talked, all the shit we dreamed\nI did it without you got a brand new team\nNo triple beams it seems like a movie\nBought two cribs, droptop, and jacuzzi\nNo more fluzzies only high class hoes\nA couple when it rains and a few when it snows\nA brand new nose to go along with my habit\nAnd a garden hose made out of 24 karat\nBought a couple parots that like to squak\nAnd they sound like you and all the shit you talk\nStep inside my shoes, you couldn't fill em' doc\nYou're too old to kid, too soft to rock\nAlready did what most love to shout\n7 years on wax and I still ain't sold out\nAnd there ain't no doubt in my mind\nThat I'm gonna stomp all over you test of time\n\n[Chorus: Kid Rock]\nI'm going platinum\nI'm going platinum\nI'm going platinum\nWe're going platinum\nDevil without a cause I'm going platinum\nDevil\nDevil\nDevil\nDevil\n\n[Interlude: Kid Rock]\nStraight out of the streets of Taylor\n3 foot high, ready to get fly\nJoe C\n\n[Verse 3: Joe-C]\nI'm the J-O-E to the C ho\nCall me Joe C ,got more game than Coleco\nI'm a freak ho call me sick\nThree foot nine with a ten foot dick\nThe ladies pick, I'm a crazy hick\nAnd rake through kind like a bum through wine\nIt's my time so I'm gonna shine like glass\nOld as piss, but small as ass\nWatch me cash smoke some hash\nYou're raking grass while I'm raking cash\nHigh-ass voice just like Aaron Neville\nAnd I'm down with The Devil\nSay we like to party, rock the party\nWe like to party, rock the party\nWe like to party, rock the party\nWe like to party, rock the party\nYou like to party, rock the party\nWe like to party, rock the party\nYou like to party, rock the party\n\n[Outro: Kid Rock]\nDevil without a cause, I'm going platinum\nCome on!"}]}
