Cause my niggas shoot too\nHold a lot of money, now that bitch want the crew\nWe just smacked whips, knocked my head out the coupe\nMade a nigga run through, said ooh\nWhy you tryna flex? Cause my niggas shoot too\nPoured a lot of money, now that bitch want the crew\nWe just smacked whips, knocked my head out the coupe\n\n[Verse 1: BandKid Jay]\nBitch I'm ballin' out like a Laker\nYou be chasin' bitches, I count paper\nBandKids be some real money makers\nAnd the Glock, with the stick out the laser\nIf you do the crime, don't be scared of the time\nMidget love to sing, never left without his 9\nIf you pull up, I'mma have to slay all mines\nAll these blue strips, bitch, I'm feelin' very fine\n\n[Chorus: Lil Mosey]\nLike ooh, made a nigga run through, said ooh\nWhy you tryna flex? Cause my niggas shoot too\nHold a lot of money, now that bitch want the crew\nWe just smacked whips, knocked my head out the coupe\nMade a nigga run through, said ooh\nWhy you tryna flex? Cause my niggas shoot too\nPoured a lot of money, now that bitch want the crew\nWe just smacked whips, knocked my head out the coupe\n\n[Verse 2: BandKid Jay]\nLike Kari said, I ain't always keep a stack\nYeah, I do this rap shit, I'mma still slap and pack\nCome and shop wit' me, cause your plug is wack\nI be sippin' Henny, cause I don't fuck wit' Jack\nIce on my neck, in the club, yeah they dance\nShawty seen the ting got her head in a trance\nYeah, I got bread, but I still rock these vans\nYou ain't gon' win if you don't take the chance\n\n[Chorus: Lil Mosey]\nLike ooh, made a nigga run through, said ooh\nWhy you tryna flex? Cause my niggas shoot too\nHold a lot of money, now that bitch want the crew\nWe just smacked whips, knocked my head out the coupe\nMade a nigga run through, said ooh\nWhy you tryna flex? Cause my niggas shoot too\nPoured a lot of money, now that bitch want the crew\nWe just smacked whips, knocked my head out the coupe"}], "artist": "Lil Mosey"}
