HEY!!\n\n[King Tee]\nIt's Friday night, on the streets of L.A\nI'm going out, been hanging around the house all day\nSo I'll take me a shower, dress like a big daddy\nStop at the Arco, put some gas in my Caddy\nArmor on my wheels, shine up my daytons\nCheck the 12 Gauge, I see jackers just waiting\nFilled up my tank, slapped on the Gas cap\nPolice scooped on front, rolling back\n\n[Skit #2: Police Officer]\n\n(*Sample of Patrol cops sirens*)\nWhen we reach up the corner, put your hands on your head..\n\n[King Tee]\nJust because I wear Khakis and a big old poke\nI'm either in the gang or either sell dope\nSo I said what the Hell? - just to show ain't fear ya\nSearch inside the car, but don't mess up in the interior\nAnd when you all done and everything is cool\nYou better call Swat cause I'm finna act a fool\n\n[Break]\n\n[King Tee]\nNow I'm on the move, a few grand in my pocket\nReached for my phone, plugged it in the socket\nSo the roam lights, so I dialed up Aladdin\nHe answered the phone and said \"What's up?\" I said \"What's happenin?\"\nHe said, \"Where you been? I said the boys had me jacked\nThey searched the whole car but they couldn't find the Gat\nSo if you wanna roll, I'll be there in the Jeepie\nSo throw on some locs, some silk shirts and some dickies\nStopped at the store to buy me a Cisco\nA 40 ounce and some crackers by Nabisco\nA pack of Dentyne then I pulled out a $10\nOops! - forgot the Supersacco and Gin\nI'm finna act a fool\n\n[Break]\n\n[King Tee]\nNow I'm driving down Compton on my way to get Aladdin\nFeeling like a pimp 'til my tape started dragging\nIt's a old tape anyway, it ain't no thing\nPulled it out and slapped in Big Daddy Kane\nGot to Aladdin's house then I honked my horn\nHe said, \"When we're coming back?\" I said: 6 in the morn'\nSo he got in the car, looking half dead\nSo I gave him my Cisco and took the 40s to the head\nNow, we're feeling tipsy and we're heading for Watts\nBoy, what do we see sitting at the bus stop?\nSexy Susanna, had a butt that kill\nPretty long hair, but they say it's not real\nAladdin yelled (this is fake..) she threw a rock in my glass\nSo I busted a U, must she broke out fast\nChecked around my back but everything was cool\nShe must have knew the King was out acting a fool, fool\n\n[Break]\n\n[King Tee]\nWe're finally arrived at the party, been like a jerk\nGot out my car, pressed the kit so the alarm would chirp\nAfter that I made my way, I tried not to fall\nCouldn't walk a straight line if they let me crawl\nGet inide the party, suckers staring at me down\nI stared right back, except I stared with the frown\nGet in the middle of the floor with my gangster stand\nNow, we can either get a love or grap a freaky and go dance\nThis girl asked me to dance, but I told the freak no\nCause she was on my tip cause of my big gold rope\nSo she tried a lot of talk, just made a little scene\nI said: Listen up! - you dirty old scandalous dope fiend\nYou're talking to a gangster and I just don't care\nAbout a girl with fake drag, fake eyes, fake hair\nFake clothes, fake nails and all that fake jewelry\nAll you wanna do is tell your friends that you screwed me\nI get nutty, act a fool when I want\nRun up when I'm drunk and I just might stump\nTake your car, your money, your super liquid girl\nCause my attitude is.. I like to fool on the world\n\n[DJ Pooh Scratching Quotes below]\nOn the streets of L.A. ---] King Tee\nI'm finna act a fool  -----] King Tee\nOn the streets of L.A. ---] King Tee\nOn the streets of L.A. ---] King Tee\nI'm finna act a fool  -----] King Tee\nOn the streets of L.A. ---] King Tee\n\nOn the streets of L.A. ---] King Tee\nI'm finna act a fool  -----] King Tee\nOn the streets of L.A. ---] King Tee\nOn the streets of L.A. ---] King Tee\nI'm finna act a fool  -----] King Tee\nOn the streets of L.A. ---] King Tee"}]}
