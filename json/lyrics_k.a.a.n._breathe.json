A heretic with fallacies upon the lips\nSick as shit, I spit it quick\nTo lift a bitch but never trip\nMy flow can block the biggest star with bars\nLike a solar eclipse\nBut I gotta be different and stand out\nSpit without apology abolishing the polished me\nBut honestly\u2014ah\u2014chronologically I mean\nI'm trying to be the dopest rapper that you'll ever see in an eternity\nI permanently permeate your brain within entirety\nThe irony of it is I'm accustomed to rejection and far too manic depressive\nTo care if I get accepted\nI'm not afraid to confess it\nRealizing all my faults are just a motherfucking blessing\nAnd the pressure is mounting up to a point that you wouldn't even believe\nI've been too stressed out feelin' like I can't breathe\nSuicide on my mind without a time to reprieve\nMy God!\n\n[Outro]\nLord knows I just wanna say I made it\nI could never deal with failure or the feeling of defeat\nI just keep working towards success\nI've been obsessing about it lately\nFeelin' like I got the weight of the world on my motherfuckin' shoulders, but I don't think I'm a make it\nBreathe\n\n\n\\\\"}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
