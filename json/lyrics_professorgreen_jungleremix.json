You love when trouble comes your way, your way, your way\n\n[Verse 1: Klashnekoff]\nWelcome to the concrete jungle\nYeah, where only so many escape\nThere's plenty of stakes, lepers and Jakes\nLions, tigers, venomous snakes\nThey come in all sizes, various shades,\nAnd they're coming for life so be very afraid\nMedia's come as your bredrens are made\nBut I'm top of the chain, so them man are bait\n??????\nIt's hunting season, Remington 8\nBanana clip, ship weight\nThem rappers are eight, blow up in your face\nDon't make a mistake and go back in your fate\nCause it goes down, with the deep peace\nWhere the man dem play police peace\nWhen the streets are paved with faeces\nAnd the youngers are an endangered species\n\n[Verse 2: Wretch 32]\n\nI'm an animal\nLearned how to swing in the jungle\nLearned the hard way to be humble\nNever me stumble\nEven when I'm hopping over snakes\nIt's a peanut race to the top of my estate\nWe were starving, acting like dinner isn't missed\nCan't see the light, behaving like gorillas in the mist\nI got a eagle eye, envisioning me finishing my script\nAnd I'm reading like feds when they read my rights, yes\nI'll forever hold my peace\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Professor Green]\nIt's blitz admist the strife here, got kids with sticks and knifes here\nIt's hype here, we know no different prick;\nIt's just life here, life the way we know from young the way we're shown\nStacked trapped in flats where our front doors don't face the roads\nGod CID spinning round in cars\nShifting criminals at large, it's hard, not to think the bits are just a bing without the bars\nJealousy's what the cheddar brings\nFor the cheddar it's anything goes, low enough to rob newly-weds for their wedding rings\n\n[Verse 3: Malik]\nWhen trouble comes your way go hard or be afraid\nIn my yard, in my estate, seen trouble in my day\nSo I'm planning to escape, but I cannot see a way\nScotland Yard got my fingerprints and my DNA\nSo I move so diligent, parents ain't feeling us\nWhy? Cause the roadsides took away our innocence\nAnd they wonder why we act so militant\nSocial engineering got me feeling like a guinea pig\nOut the wrong hatch jump in your bimmer\nMan'll roar you up before they warm up your dinner\nSo when you get a pass in my city don't thank me\nThank P, weapons so lanky brother\nPrice of life is cheaper than a oner\nSometimes I wonder how I keep from going under\nAnd this is for my youngers who been locked up every summer\nNext year the judge is gonna give you crooked score numbers in the jungle\n\n[Bridge: Maverick Sabre]\nEvery day is warring, never give a warning\nViolence is the only way you settle things\nEvery day is hating, money that I'm making\nJealous cause I'm moving on to better things\nEvery day is fighting, rolling in the night now\nAll you do is watch everyone else get far, you say that life is hard\nWhen you're out here in this jungle\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2011-01-03"}]}
