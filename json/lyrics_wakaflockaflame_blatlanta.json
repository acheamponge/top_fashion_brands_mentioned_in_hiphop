You niggas don't get it yet\nI'm the realest in it and I built your image\nTurn any block to Virginia Tech\nYou a pussy nigga never been a threat\nI'm throwing bullets, Eli Manning\nAny time you can intercept like Brandon Lee die in your set\nLike blaow!\nNigga I ain't playin' no games\nI ain't talking 'bout a Rover when I say I got range like blaow!\nFrontin' for the fame get your name on the news\nCuz I really got aim with the tool like blaow!\nShoot outs ain't nothing that's new to me\nI'm only 2 or 3 he gone catch 2 or 3\nRight through his jewelry nigga you food to me\nShouldn't have said what you said you gone do to me\nThese rappers as fake as a 3 dollar bill\nAnd I really don't care how they feel\nDon't make you a gangster cuz you touched a mill '\nPut you on the plate, i make you a meal\nDon't make me reveal the truth about you niggas\nYou know that I will green light you for real\nIt's nothing my nigga I put on your head on a brick that you signed for your deal\nBoy we know you a fa\u00e7ade\nKnow you won't ride, everything you say a lie\nAin't no surprise, beefing with me isn't wise\nAll these crooks oversize, swallow your pride\nOr you can swallow this nine, really don't matter to me\nI let you decide maybe I might let you slide, sike, homicide\nBefore this rap I was your favorite rappers favorite shooter\nIt ain't a question I'm a rider like I drive a hoover\nI'm too G so without me there wouldn't be no Google\nYour street cred a 3.50 without my approval", "image": "https://images.genius.com/615016a72f645e322ab9388f4cca0404.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "I Can\u2019t Rap Vol. 1", "title": "Blatlanta"}]}
