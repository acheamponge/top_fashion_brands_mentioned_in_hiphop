Cole]\nWishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold\nLately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls\nYup, diamonds and pearls\nAnd enough money I could rule the world (Cole World)\nIf I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world (Cole)\nIf I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world\nIf I ruled the world, if I ruled the world\nI could rule the world man, if I ruled the world (Cole World)\n\n[Verse 3: J. Cole]\nIs this a dream? Well that's how it feel\nSometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it's real\nI specifically remember, no heat in the winter\nNow I supply heat for the winter\nThen I skate to the beach for the winter\nWhen it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip\nNo cleats I'm a winner\nShow love to the hoes and the freaks I remember\nHit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners\nMeet a young Dennis, the menace to society\nCheck my sobriety, fuck hoes in varieties\nShame that these things is the reasons you admire me\nBut, I'm getting dough man, these flows gon' retire me\nSplurging all crazy\nSwitching lanes in the Range swerving all crazy (Swerve)\nStyle on Nadal, I've been serving y'all lately, cheddar on Federer\nBall till I fall, et cetera, et cetera\n\n[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhen\u00e9 Aiko]\nWishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold\nLately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls\nYup, diamonds and pearls\nAnd enough money I could rule the world\nIf I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world\nIf I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world\nIf I ruled the world, if I ruled the world\nI could rule the world man, if I ruled the world"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
