The day his father passed away\nLeft him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin'\nAl B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy\nHit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy\nHit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty\nBoned so much that summer, even had him a baby\nSee back-back then-then, if you had a car\nYou was the Chi-Town version of Baby\nAnd I was just a virgin, a baby\nOne of the reasons I looked up to him crazy\nI used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked\nFelt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked\nWe'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall\nThey had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin 'em all\nWith the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog\nFuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers\nSo, put me on with these hoes homie\nHe told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie\n\n[Hook: Kanye West]\nDrive slow homie\nDrive slow\nYou never know homie, about these hoes homie\nYou need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie\n\n[Verse 2: Paul Wall]\nWhat it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving\nThe candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing\nThem elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac\nTrunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed\nI'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies\nAllow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes\nIt's a star-studded event when I valet park\nOpen up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark\nYou see them fours crawlin'? You see them screens fallin'?\nThe disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'\nI'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab\nBut I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab\nA young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla\nRidin' somethin' candy coated, crawlin' like a caterpillar\nI'm tipping on them fours, I'm jammin' on this Screw\nI'm looking for them hoes baby, what it do? Drive slow homie\n\n[Interlude: GLC & Kanye West]\nTurn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes (drive slow homie)\nIf you're ridin' round the city with nowhere to go (drive slow homie)\nLive today, cause tomorrow, man, you never know\nYou never know homie, might need some hoes homie\nYou need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie\n\n[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]\nMy car's like the movie, my car's like the crib\nI got more TV's in here than where I live\nAnd that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit\nAnd everything I flip, you know it's something serious\nI got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims\nI got the baller genetics, baby this evidence\nYou see a player flicking and how you ain't convinced\nThat you should gon kiss it, just a lil bit\nI wear my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain\nMy canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings\nThey see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king\nWith that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green\nMy woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues\nMy cylinder quiet like tip-toes\nI sold O's and this I know\nWhen you see them hoes, lil homie drive slow\n\n(Tony Williams harmony ad-libs)\n\n[Verse 4: T.I.]\nLooking at life through my rearview, all the problems I had\nCould be seen a lot clearer after time had passed\nKnown for living so fast, they wonder how he don't crash\nWith 220 on the dash, and he constantly mashin'\n\"Why don't he slow down?\" they be constantly askin'\nBut me in the fast lane is like metal and magnets\nNow I ain't trying to say that this the way of the masses\nBut it's so hard to change, I love this shit with a passion\nSince me and C were cuttin' class, and showin' our ass\nShooting out in broad day in the middle of traffic\nI remember sellin' crack faster than I could bag it\nJust sharin' my past wit ya shawty, I ain't e'en braggin'\nMe and Cap got life, them other folk got blasted\nHad a partner O.D. and after this all happened\nLife the only thing that kept a pimp from crying and laughing\nThen the Lord smiled on me at the end of the madness\nI never thought that I'da made it this far rappin'\nFor introducing the youth to what we now call \"trappin'\"\nConsidered now a classic, who'd've imagined?\nMe in Milano getting models in next year's fashion\nSo nowadays, they can call me old-fashioned\nBut it's way too much cash to see blue lights flashin'\nSo I guess the moral of this here class is:\nLife about who make it, not about who make it the fastest\nDrive slow homie\n\n[Outro: Kanye West (Chopped & Screwed)]\nYeah, bumpa bumpa bump bump\nDrive slow homie\nDrive slow homie\nYou never know homie, might need some hoes homie\nYou need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie\nDrive slow homie"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
