You hate this?\nThen you see me in real life and don't say shit\nEnough of basic, let me hit 'em where it hurts\nShiv 'em with the verse and Kers will sink 'em make their liver burst\nI deliver words crazy 'til they're in a hearse\nStill alive they didn't die but I prefer to injure first\nThen hit 'em with the headshot\nI wanna see the legs drop\nMy rapping is a weapon it's like acid in your head and it\nAttacks you in a second know what happened do you reckon\nI'm the king of the game now, fuck your opinion\nIt doesn't count 'cause you're losin' and we're winnin'\nI'm cruisin' with a vision that is movin' on a mission\nAnd you're trippin' just to listen, always knew me as the sickest true?\n\n[Hook: Kerser]\nPut 'em there, you can line 'em up\nWe can tell that they're biting us\nWe don't care 'cause we're high enough\nSo we light it up, come get high with us\nPut 'em there, you can line 'em up\nWe can tell that they're biting us\nWe don't care 'cause we're high enough\nSo we light it up, come get high with us\n\n[Verse 2: Rates]\nI never cared if they were taking offence, Rates\nI made sure it ain't a name you forget, wait\nI ain't finished, stack 'em up on my plate\nI stumble the rappers afraid put 'em back in their place, ashamed\nI had to keep it up, thinking back when I said\n\"Always loved this heaps, I never rap for a trend\"\nI was using the pens as a drum, smashing my test\nI got some talent and skills, I couldn't graff with my friends\nI was too busy dropping styles that I could run with\nEvery time we drop a track, these rappers couldn't fuck with\nI'm standin' proud and they fallin' down with one hit\nI've been around with every noun down\nWhen the drum hits, clown on the fuckwits, I take over\nWhat we original innovators, we take what we want\nYou can face what we got, see you're long gone\nWe the brothers we backing you know the bond's strong\n\n[Hook: Kerser]\nPut 'em there, you can line 'em up\nWe can tell that they're biting us\nWe don't care 'cause we're high enough\nSo we light it up, come get high with us\nPut 'em there, you can line 'em up\nWe can tell that they're biting us\nWe don't care 'cause we're high enough\nSo we light it up, come get high with us\n\n[Bridge: Rates]\nCome on now you feel the vibe with us and I know\nWe put our heart in time and time for the show\nThis is real, it will die with us and we go\nSo put \u2018em there, you can line \u2018em up and they know\nCome on now you feel the vibe with us and I know\nWe put our heart in time and time for the show\nThis is real, it will die with us and we go\nSo put \u2018em there, you can line \u2018em up and they know\n\n[Hook: Kerser]\nPut 'em there, you can line 'em up\nWe can tell that they're biting us\nWe don't care 'cause we're high enough\nSo we light it up, come get high with us\nPut 'em there, you can line 'em up\nWe can tell that they're biting us\nWe don't care 'cause we're high enough\nSo we light it up, come get high with us"}], "artist": "Kerser"}
