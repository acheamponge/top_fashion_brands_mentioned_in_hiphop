Ain't you got enough sense to look at it? Supreme court was started when there was 13 million people in this country. You got 9 judges with 13 million people. You got 250 million people. How the hell you gonna take [one of those*] to supreme court with 9 chicken shit [mother fuckers*] and make a court [out of them*] for 2 hundred million people. It's impossible man. Your government is a shell of madness that you're preaching off in schools. It's unreal. It's not real guy, It's a game!"}], "artist": "Necro"}
