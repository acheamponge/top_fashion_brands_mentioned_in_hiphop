Uh!)\n\nI know you like to show off you're bust in gowns\n'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around\nAnd we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses\n'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses\nYou watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh\nWith you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off\nAnd you try goin harder than star wars Anakin\n'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin\n\nGot a belt full of steel you can call me santa\nYou better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana\nAnd don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards\n'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards\nAlways equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay\n'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA\nAnd I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son\nBut you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun\nThey call me stretch where I'm from 'cause I'm extended out\nFind your ass in my house and I'll send it out\nI got a custom made gun so the cops link my shot\nSo far.. how many mother fuckers do you think I got?", "album": null, "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/787eb0fed4a05aa802dee3238c64431a.792x792x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young Buck"}
