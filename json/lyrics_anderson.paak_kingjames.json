Coming with me\nWhat about the neighbors? Coming with me\nWhat about the seed? It's coming with me\nThe people that you came with? Coming with me\nWhat about the love? Coming with me\nWhat about the neighbors? Coming with me\nWhat about the seed? It's coming with me\nThe people that you came with? You're coming with me\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nHey\n(Okay now) Hey now\n(Just don't stay down) Uh, can't stay now\n(Let's go shake down) Until we get what we need, oh yeah\n(Okay now) I'm okay now\n(Just don't stay down) Yeah, can't hold me down\n(Let's go shake down) And let it fall like the leaves, I wanna know\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe couldn't stand to see our children shot dead in the streets\nBut when I finally took a knee\nThem crackers took me out the league\nNow I'm not much for games\nBut I play for keeps\nAnd we salute King James for using his change\nTo create some equal opportunities\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nCold stares can never put the fear in me\nThere's a movement we've been groovin' on\nYou can move or stay your ass asleep\nLet's just not talk about it\nEverything they tried to hide\nWe're taking back for yours and mine\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat about the love? Coming with me\nWhat about the neighbors? Coming with me\nWhat about the seed? It's coming with me\nThe people that you came with? Coming with me\nWhat about the love? Coming with me\nWhat about the neighbors? Coming with me\nWhat about the seed? It's coming with me\nPeople that you came with? You're coming with me\nWhat about the love\nWhat about the seed? It's coming with me\nWhat about the love? Coming with me\nWhat about the seed? It's coming with me\nPeople that you came with? You're coming with me\n\n[Outro]\nOkay now\nJust don't stay down\nLet's go shake down (Shake, shake, shake, shake)\nOkay now\nJust don't stay down\nLet's go shake down (Shake, shake, shake, shake)"}]}
