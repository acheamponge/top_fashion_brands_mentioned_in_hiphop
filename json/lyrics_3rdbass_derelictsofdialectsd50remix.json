It's Serch and I crush this\nMental need for oppression\nOppressed and all vexed and just placed a suggestion\nLesson or loss enforce those in\nA spot who got your head frozen\nDefrost the eye and spy on whose hurtin'\nOn act two, he tried to close curtain\nBut intermission I glimpsed and I clock more\nDerelicts watch act three and the encore\n\n[Outro]\nIndividuals who are never satisfied with the static standards\nSet by the masses -- the masses have always been lethargic\nThey have always opposed greatness for it is beyond them\nTo even.. comprehend greatness", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ba67f25eba0c6951171aa44e82a3051a.600x600x1.jpg", "album": "Derelicts of Dialect", "title": "Derelicts Of Dialect (SD50 Remix)", "year": "1991-06-18"}]}
