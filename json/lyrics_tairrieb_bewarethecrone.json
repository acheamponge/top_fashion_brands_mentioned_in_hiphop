I call upon thee\nBind my enemies and leave them weak\nFrom the poetry I speak\nGuard the circle which I cast\nWith a wolf to clear my path\nAs I go faster cause I have to\nCraft a rhyme designed To Catch a\nThief and Kill a Mockingbird\nLine to line and word for word\nThe mistress of magick will bewitch\nBeguile as I kick it freestyle\nWatch the transformation happen\nFrom screamin\u2019 back to rappin\u2019\nTappin\u2019 into my intuition\nOn a mission, y\u2019all keep wishin\u2019\nI\u2019d go away but I won\u2019t\nI\u2019m here to stay like the women\u2019s vote\nThrowing up the goat as I quote Macbeth\n\"What\u2019s done is done\" but I ain\u2019t done yet\nLet that resonate like \u201cThe Bell Jar\u201d\nWhile I write my memoir\nInvoking smoke from the microphone\nBeware the Crone\n\n[Chorus]\nBeware the Crone (Beware the Crone)\nJust like Medusa she will turn you to stone\nI said, beware the Crone (Beware the Crone)\nJust like Medusa she will turn you to stone\nTurn you to stone, yeah\u2026\n\n[Verse 3]\nI step into the light you adjust the lens\nHocus Pocus I\u2019m back again\nWonder how, what, why, where the fuck I\u2019ve been\nYou can\u2019t focus or comprehend\nI transcend the underground\nWhen the sky is black and the moon is round\nI rise like the tides the sea brings\nStraight from the City of the Angels and got wings\nSymbolic of a phoenix from a flame\nAnd this dame still got game and a name\nVerses in my veins\nGivin\u2019 birth to a new life takes pain\nAnd labor, lots of flavor with heart\nWon\u2019t compromise myself or my art\nLike Joan of Arc, I slay the microphone\nBeware the Crone\n\n[Chorus](x2)\nBeware the Crone (Beware the Crone)\nJust like Medusa she will turn you to stone\nI said, beware the Crone (Beware the Crone)\nJust like Medusa she will turn you to stone\nTurn you to stone, yeah\u2026\n\n[Outro]\n(It\u2019s blasphemous and wicked)\nAs the paper burns\n(It\u2019s blasphemous and wicked)\nA spell is cast\n(It\u2019s blasphemous and wicked)\nThe past had left a permanent mark\n(It\u2019s blasphemous and wicked)\nThe power of the planets have been petitioned"}], "artist": "Tairrie B"}
