(hold up)\nThis year we gonna make bucks\nSee me swimming through coins with Scrooge McDuck\nAll forces united in one\nYou see God through the Father and I am the Son\nLook at the black prism\nIf my mother didn't give birth to light, you would have no vision\nAnd I'm Uptown's finest\nRoyalty, you should call me your highness\nCannibal O (O) handle you slow\nWe got that black pepper for your sinus\n\n[Chorus]\nWe got that black pepper for your sinus!\n(Cannibal O handle you slow)\n...And I'm Uptown's finest, you rewind this IGC is behind this!\n\n[Verse 2]\n\"Mirror, mirror, on the wall\nWho is the dopest of us all?\"\nVast Aire! And your style is so last year\nReappear like Nightcrawler mist in the air (mist in the air)\nAnd if you dare hip hop's here\nI still love her can't wait to get a whiff of her hair\nThe messiah is here and it's clear\nPut the sword down I'll replace your fears\nI'm a respectable man try not to swear\nAnd when the ancestors speak you lend them your ear\nAnd don't judge\nCause every man that strayed from righteousness still needs peers\nIt's true I'm just giving you hope\nYou was dying I'm just cutting the rope\nYou can't come around these parts\nUnless you got heart, but you can not cope\n\n[Chorus]", "album": "Aireplane", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c7b4446f820cec5cc4795264acd45500.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
