{"songs": [{"lyrics": "Everytime I flow I get this vision and I know\nEverytime I know, I manifest it then I go then\nEverywhere I go I plant a seed I hope it grows\nBut every seed planted ain't always granted life though\nSome grow slow and then they flourish in the end\nThen again some grow fast and they die out as soon as it begin\nNow many moons ago my seed planted into minds that feed\nYes indeed, I cut out fleet\nI'm sweatin' tears until I'm freed\nMy sector the 213, my protector the E-Y-E\nJust soak it in like mother earth this earth\nWho was once this jewel\nIs just a cesspool for fools truly well\nThere's another chapter to that neverending captured rapture\nI tap your mental and stroke the mind so gentle\nI'm the sunshine not starred, now I'm irregular and bizarre\nBut I know exactly who I are, yeah\nAnd I love keepin true and avant-garde\nNobody likes to be a waterboy forever\nNever seeing the field thinkin you got it together\nPlaying foosball in the street\nIt's yo' game but it's they concrete\nAnd it's my ball, it's my treat\nIt's my world, it's my head\nI live in a hellhole in the wall\nAnd i'll never see the light of day\nSubliminals controllin all of y'all but they won't take mines away\nWhat is that instinct to react before you think\nAnd'll make that thought complete\nTell it to the weak, smell before you eat\nSee I never try to mislead and I walk this planet keyed\nYes indeed, I cut out fleet\nI'm sweatin' tears until I'm freed\nMy sect of the 213 but protect to the E-Y-E\nJust soak it in despite all this anguish\nIt's a book of human language\n\nA book of human language\n(A book of language)\nIt's a book of human language\n(A book, a book for reading and reading is fundamental)\nIt's a book of human language\n(And reading is for the mental, for the nondimensional)\n(Unintentional yet unconventional here to the)\nJust a book of human language\n(And books are for reading and this is a book of human language)\n(A book of human language)\n\nThe lion will never ever lie down with the lamb\nThat's how I was taught when I sought out to tell them who I am\nI exam, I live for the bank and swam, changed my program\nBut they hold me back like water in a dam, but I won't be held\nEven though on a trail with bread crumbs\nI'll take it to the max headroom\nYou'll need more than excedrin\nCodeine, morphine, nicotine, caffeine\nIn yo canteen in your blood stream\nI'm a well oiled machine, keep my area quarantined\nFrom the gardens of Florentine to the shores of Tripoli\nScientifically ain't no river me, I'm terrifically well spoken\nSee many attempts to get a glimpse to see what the hell I'm smokin'\nBut it ain't no 'bama, I just mastered this bastard grammar\nI go outside my parameter and stretch out my diameter\nIt gets bigger than gamera\nSo picture that with your camera\nGots steez-amina and steezyle\nMy steezory as a child ain't much more harsh than yours\nI just express mines a little different cause\nLife ain't fair but who really cares\nI know some people thats over here but they wanna be over there\nI know some real cool cats yeah, but they wanna be bears\nAnd when I see 'em chasing chickens, I get heated like a flare\nOn your face looks scared, your spacesuits got a tear\nYo' a square and I'm beyond compare and I'm rare\nYeah and I'm sick of turning apples into pears\nSoon as I get a little bit of it, I'mma share\nSee I never try to mislead and I walk this planet keyed\nYes indeed, I cut out fleet\nI'm sweatin tears until I'm freed\nMy sect of the 213 but protect to the E-Y-E\nJust soak it in despite all this anguish\nFor a book of human language\n\n{*Aceyalone interacts with the crowd then freestyles*}\n\nNow there's only so many of us who were chosen to shine... could be us all\nBut if you knows how to climb, you'll be there before they mount up\nNow count up all your memories, divide that by your fantasies\nCause ya wanna live life so glamourously, glittery and all shimmery\nSee everydays a jamboree but with good times comes misery\nAnd misery enjoys company so I hope you got your sensory\nNow it really don't make no sense to me, the increasing intensity\nAnd that test is out show density\nAnd I know you don't want to be tested right\nYou don't wanna be tested right\nWell there ain't gone be no mutiny\nWhen they look down me on scrutiny\nSee reality ain't new to me\nAnd being dumb ain't cute to me\nYo I got somethin' I found out I could get y'all all involved\nJust watch the bouncin' ball but see it don't bounce, it revolves see\nNow I don't think that I'm unreasonable\nJust because I don't really have to have no need a reason to flow\nEvery season I go squeezin' they hands\nAnd I lead 'em along see\nI leave dem a long line of slack and then pulls it right back\nSee if I give 'em too much, they might mistake my kindness for weakness\nIf I don't give 'em enough, they might think I don't possess uniqueness\nBut on the contrary, I got the bombest berries in the fruit tree\nWith the nutrients to cleanse and rinse your bodies of all the toxins\nI locks in, I use my viewfinder, I'mma give you a reminder\nI'm on a straight and narrow with no blinders, no blinders\nAnd I still see the rhymes designers that bite like sidewinders\nWith ten toes down, I spin flows round and round at an angle with anger\nThe angular warlock like strangler\nSociopathic, graphic, psycho symptom drastic plastic coded, bloated\nJust like fatty tissue acid, I'm jurassic\nI unmask it with a breadbasket full of molded yeast\nBecause the stenches'll clinch ya once my gases are released\nSo just inhale cause you know you know you inhale\nAs it is in heaven, this is to all the sistren and the brethren\nAnd it goes....
