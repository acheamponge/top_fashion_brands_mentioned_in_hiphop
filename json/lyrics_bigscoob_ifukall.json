Me? I want the wallet\nI'm tryna run a credit check, hit the store and write some cheques\nBeat you till there's nothing left, later, ma', you can step\nIf money ain't involved, please tell me what's my motivation\nBroke bitches, no ambition, always bringing aggravation\nSo I choose to fall back, keep my dick from a bitch\nI ain't with these pussy games, I be on some other shit\n\n[Chorus: Irv Da Phenom]\nBaby if you call me\nMaybe then I'll fall through\nYou can come and fuck with me\nBaby if you call me\nMaybe then I'll come through\nScrew you up, you'll see\nIf you call me, call me, babe\nCall me, call me, babe\nI'll be on my way, girl\nI'm on my, on my way\nOn my, on my way\nOn my, on my way, girl\n\n[Verse 2: Big Rich]\nOk, here we go again\nHang up on a nigga, then you call me right back again\nJust love to fight, more drama every night\nOut here on the grind, tryna get our situation right\nPatience is a virtue, promise it won't hurt you\nAlways rushing me home, bitch, I ain't got a curfew\nAlways listening to your friends, them hoes lonely\nThey leave when they find them a man, them hoes phoney\nI ain't tryna mislead you, I'm tryna feed you\nThem other niggas get what they want, then they leave you\nSo pause on that bullshit, I ain't tryna hear it though\nGirl I ain't perfect, looking for a miracle\nI could be building with the next bitch\nInstead I'm in the lab working on my next hit\nThese women come and go, they usually pay a toll\nBut you a little different, so please slow your roll\n\n[Chorus: Irv Da Phenom]\nBaby if you call me\nMaybe then I'll fall through\nYou can come and fuck with me\nBaby if you call me\nMaybe then I'll come through\nScrew you up, you'll see\nIf you call me, call me, babe\nCall me, call me, babe\nI'll be on my way, girl\nI'm on my, on my way\nOn my, on my way\nOn my, on my way, girl\n\n[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]\nI know you're the only woman I wanna be with\nBut lately when I'm home, you be on some different shit\nI hear you baby, I ain't really tryna argue with ya\nYou keep repeating yourself and I get the damn picture\nHell with ya, it's plenty grupies tuggin' on my zipper\nAnd I can easily be diggin' on all up in they liver\nA good boy, but them bad intentions creepin' on me\nI play the asshole, so they leave me by my lonely\nI keep the bank account with several Os\nI ain't sleepin' with several hoes\nYeah, they want me, but I give them several nos\nI'm just tryna get the paper, know I make a few mistakes, uh\nI thought you'd be grateful, I put the food on the table\nAnd I know you are, hard to be married to a star\nI'm tryna put you in them grown woman cars\nThis ain't the ideal life, but you the ideal wife\nDon't blow me up baby, I'm coming home tonight\nEven if you don't call\n\n[Chorus: Irv Da Phenom]\nBaby if you call me\nMaybe then I'll fall through\nYou can come and fuck with me\nBaby if you call me\nMaybe then I'll come through\nScrew you up, you'll see\nIf you call me, call me, babe\nCall me, call me, babe\nI'll be on my way, girl\nI'm on my, on my way\nOn my, on my way\nOn my, on my way, girl"}], "artist": "Big Scoob"}
