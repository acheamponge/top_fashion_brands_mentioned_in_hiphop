As long as my cards flash\nI will not fall flat, my vibe is a tall glass\nYou're trying to stall that, but I got a hall pass\nGet down and ball fast, kiss on this long shaft\nThen hang off the ball sack and wait for the call back, trick\n\n[Hook]\nYou said that you felt so free\nAnd you were so alive with me, me\nYou said that together we be (we be, what?)\nImmortal (Immortal!)\nImmortal (Immortal!)\nImmortal (Immortal!)\nBut now you're so dead to me\n(Goddammit!)\nYou're dead to me\n(Goddammit!)\nYou're dead to me\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn a bucket of chains\nMy soul wrestles with your memory, it's stuck in my brain\nIn full guard, I drop off like Citizen Kane\nSaying only but a word, what a sinister thang\nMmm, Gods at odds with whoever the queen is\nEspecially when she cut me like a seamstress\nSometimes I wanna walk away and act decent\nBut most the time I wanna put you in the cement\nYou broke me down and sold all of the leases\nFolded my goals and your soul and spit in the creases\nWho the fuck do you think you are, huh? Jesus?\nYou are my Sonja, I know ya folded on Heathcliff\nAnd every time that I try to save ya from these cliffs\nYou looked at me like I was riddled with diseases\nI'm done trying, enough lying to me bitch\nYou need to lie to yourself and pick up the pieces\n\n[Hook]\nYou said that you felt so free\nAnd you were so alive with me, me\nYou said that together we be, (we be, what?)\nImmortal (Immortal!)\nImmortal (Immortal!)\nImmortal (Immortal!)\nBut now you're so dead to me\n(Goddammit!)\nYou're dead to me\n(Goddammit!)\n\n[Verse 3]\nLast night I had a funeral for you in my mind\nIt was a beautiful affair, we had a wonderful time\nWe had hors d\u2019oeuvres and sore words for you and your whore nerves\nAnd laughed it up so much it made up for the torture\nForgot what the chores were, oh yeah I remember how\nLet's chop up her body, dismember every severed ounce\nAnd finally say goodbye to this hell-bound, hellish hound\nShit, good riddance bitch I'm about to get me some better now\nThis was a real blast like mining in eel shafts\nMy timing is real fast, for grinding this peel back\nLetting you know, all of the things that you do to me\nTurn all of the lights down, it's time for the eulogy\n\n[Bridge] (2X)\nI've just been trying to fly and dying for you to be\nHigh with me in the sky you're so [?] do this like all of the time\nAnd if you don't totally mind I'd like now to say my goodbyes\nI'm firing your soul in the sky to never be seen by my eye\n\n[Bridge (Cut Off)]\nI've just been trying to fly and dying for you to be\nHigh with me in the sky you're so [?] do this like all of the time\nAnd if you don't totally mind I'd like now to say my goodbyes\nI'm firing your soul in the sky to never be seen...\n\nYou're dead to me\nYou're so dead to me\nYou're dead to me\nYou're so dead to me", "title": "Dead To Me", "year": "2018-01-04", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/563aa519874f9c6cf16dd80e87bfbc8d.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
