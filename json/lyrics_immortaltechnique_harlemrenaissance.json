Du Bois versus Marcus Garvey\nAnd we ended up, selling out to everybody\nThe Dutch Schultz and John Gotti's\nBanksters, modern day gangsters\nImmobile army\nThey wanna move us all out the NYC\nLike they did to the Jews\nWith the Alhambra Decree\nSo support your own businesses and do the knowledge\nCause the real Harlem Renaissance is economic\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Outro]\nWhen they were saying it is the renaissance of Harlem\nThey didn't mean that we had stake in that\nThey meant to say that they could make money out of us\nThey are coming in with all kinds of prejudices\nIn Brooklyn they're doing the same thing\nIn Queens they're doing the same thing\nThe Bronx, there's hardly any place which is affordable\nI mean those people are putting up condominiums which start from a million dollars\nHow many people in this community make that kind of money\nHow many people HAVE that kind of money\nPeople of Harlem, they are the natural allies of the oppressed people of the world\nWhether the struggle is in Panama, in Africa, Cuba\nWe spend money with the wrong people\nWe are looking for love with people\nWho don't love us\nWhat's wrong with loving each other and making sure we are protected", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cbb36cff0867b087bc47fcf98b7cd803.300x300x1.jpg", "album": "The 3rd World", "year": "2008-06-24"}]}
