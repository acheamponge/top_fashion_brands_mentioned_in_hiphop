{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1: MC Ren]\nA 100 miles and runnin' - MC Ren, I hold the gun and\nYou want me to deal with the situation and it's done in\nSince I'm stereotyped I'm going to take a stand\nAnd if you try to stop me, I don't give a damn\nChances are usually not good\n'Cause I'm frisked with my hands on a hot hood\nAnd gettin' jacked by the you-know-who\nWhen in a black and white the capacity is two\nWe're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers\nNot wearing medallions, 'cause we ain't going out like suckers\nThey're out to take our heads for what we said in the past\nAnd thats the reason why Ren is running fast\nI didn't stutter when I said \"Forget Tha Police\"\n'Cause it's hard for a brother to get peace\nNow it's broken and can't be fixed\n'Cause police and a kid from the ghetto don't mix so\nNow I'm creepin' through the fall\nRunnin' like a team, we'll see, I might have slayed y'all\nSo for now pack the gun and\nHold it in the air 'cause MC Ren has a 100 miles of runnin'\n\n[Interlude]\nInto this news. Four fugitives are on the run\nFBI sources tell us that the four are headed\n100 miles to their homebase, Compton\n\n[Break: Dr. Dre + Eazy-E]\nShut up and lend me an ear\nSo I can tell you why\n\n[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]\nRunnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase\nWith a steady pace on the face that just we raced\nThe road ahead goes on and on\nIt even seems like its gettin' longer than a marathon\nRunnin' on but never runnin' out\nStayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out\nHitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do\nBut nobody's pickin' up a Brother Witta Attitude\nConfused, yo but Dre's never had nothin' to lose\nOne of the few who's been accused and abused\nOf the crime of poisonin' young minds\nBut you don't know nothin' til you been in my shoes\nAnd Dre is back from the C-P-T\nDroppin' some tracks that's D-O-P-E\nSo laid upon the P-O-L-I-C-E!\nAnd anybody else that disagrees\nStuck and runnin' hard, moving fast\n'Cause I been a brother known for havin' a notorious past\nMy mind was slick - my temper was too quick\nNow the FBI's all over my stick\n\n[Verse 3: Eazy-E]\nGot the stick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock\nThat's when the E jumped off the startin' block\nA 100 miles from home and, yo, it's a long stretch\nA little sprintin' young brother that they won't catch\nYeah, back to Compton again\nYo, it's either that or the Federal pen\n'Cause brothers been runnin' since beginning of time\nTakin' a minute just to tell you what's on my mind\nRunnin' like I just don't care\nCompton's 50 miles but, yo, I'mma get there\nArchin' my back and on a straight rough\nJust like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the hell out\nFrom city to city I'm a menace as I pass by\nRippin' up things just so you can remember I'm\nA straight up brother that's done in, gunnin' and comin'\nStraight up homeboy, a 100 miles and runnin'\n\n[Interlude]\nThis one goes out to the four brothers from Compton\nYou're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you:\nNowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide\nGood luck brothers\n\n[Verse 4: MC Ren]\nRunning for my life I hate to lose\nShow me on the news but I hate to be abused\nI know it was a set-up - so now I'm gonna get up\nEven if the FBI wants me to shut up\nBut I've got 10 000 brothers strong\nAnd as long as I got \"Run fast from the police\" song\nThey treat my group like dirt\nWhile their whole damn family is wearin' our T-shirts\nSo I'mma run til I can't run no more\n'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score\nI got a urge to kick down doors\nAt my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls\n\n[Verse 5: Dr. Dre]\nClouds are dark and brothers are hidin'\nAnd it's funny 'cause all these stupid suckers are riding\nWe started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it\nSo now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it\nThe number's even - now I'm leavin'\nWe're never gettin' took by a woman with a weave in\nHer and the troops are right behind me\nBut they're so stupid, they'll never find me\n\n[Verse 6: Eazy-E]\nOne more mile to go through the dark streets\nRunnin' like a tired brother on my own two feet\nBut you know I never stumble or lag last\nI'm almost home so I better run fast\nTearin' up everything in sight\nIt's a little crazy young brother dodging the searchlight\nNow that chase, is stopped and done and\nFour young brothers goin' crazy with\nA 100 miles of runnin'!\n\nStop!
