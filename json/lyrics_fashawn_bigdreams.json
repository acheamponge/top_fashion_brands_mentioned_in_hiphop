Cole]\nKnow what I'm saying\nClose your eyes man\nPicture that man\nClose your eyes and envision this\nYou know what I'm saying\nIt's the life\nIt's a Cole world\nBig cars, expensive linen\nYou know what it is\nGrizzly City to the Ville nigga\nReal niggas connect\nKnow what I'm saying respect\nFayettnam all the way to Grizzly City nigga\nBig Dreams\nIt's the F", "title": "Big Dreams"}]}
