Best likened to a child's insatiable curiosity, they impute their compulsive, insistent tinkering to much lived experience, and even to obscure neurological phenomena. Their exchange lends precious \u2013 and comic \u2013 insight into a frightening capacity for invention, and a knowing approach to craft that is at once sure and relentlessly self-critical. They spoke in the wake of a minor controversy that followed the online launch of the single \u201cTheraflu\u201d, which Kanye released through his G.O.O.D Music label (in collaboration with DJ Khaled, DJ Pharris and the producer Hit Boy). Predictably, the pharmaceutical combine Novartis objected to the title. The track also featured the lyric \u201csomeone tell PETA my mink is dragging on the floor,\u201d which drew immediate fire from the animal-rights group\n\nKanye West: Yo yo, what\u2019s good?!\n\nPharrell Williams: What up, killer?!\n\nKW: Shit, chillin\u2019, vibin\u2019 about changing the name of that song and trying to figure out what the name of the song should be. You know, the \u201cTheraflu\u201d song?\n\nPW: Yeah\n\nKW: Yeah, we\u2019re about to give it a new name\n\nPW: It\u2019s getting that big \u2013 they\u2019re going that crazy about it?\n\nKW: Oh, yeah they have an issue. Just the title and here\u2019s still a window of opportunity for us to change it. \u201cOh, well, I don\u2019t want to call it \u2018Theraflu\u2019. I\u2019m calling the song this\u2026\u201d And then people are like, \u201coh, he changed the song to this\u201d, and then that\u2019s what it is, because when I did the song, I actually did not know that it would get to the point that grandmothers are talking about it, you know? Like why did I give them that level of promotion?\n\nPW: Yeah, trust me, they\u2019re thankful. No matter what, they\u2019re thankful. This segues perfectly into what I wanted to talk to you about. Which is what is it like to be \u2013 and I know how I feel about it \u2013 but you\u2019re definitely one of my peers, and one that I look at and say \u201cHe gets it, but I\u2019d love to hear his take on why we aspire to be.\u201d It\u2019s almost a disease to be a perfectionist. Nothing is ever quite good enough. What is it like to look at things and say to yourself, \u201cI know that they don\u2019t get it but maybe one day they will.\u201d\n\nKW: It is so funny this is such an example of being a perfectionist, right? This song is out and I\u2019m going to change the name, like I want to perfect this moment some more. Well, I think it\u2019s just if you\u2019re a perfectionist, that\u2019s just what you do. You know, there are slackers there are people who are satisfied by delivering everything they have \u2013 with their knowledge, their financial situation, their level of exposure \u2013 to deliver the best product possible. I respect, look up to, and look to Walt Disney and Steve Jobs who dedicated their time, soul and energy to delivering the best product that they knew they could. There\u2019s a lot of psychology that goes into it. What can you give to human existence? How can you push the culture forward? And when you\u2019re a perfectionist, at a certain point you feel a responsibility in what you put out, and what could trickle down from it. If you put out things that are so over-the-top and magnificent, what trickles down from it could at least be good because there are more followers than there are leaders\n\nPW: Yeah I agree\u2026You know what the funny thing is that we\u2019ve never done it on a Kanye West album, it might be time for that\n\nKW: Yeah!\n\nPW: It might be time for that\n\nKW: Yeah, we started on that shit for [Watch] The Throne\n\nPW: Oh yeah! That was a very serious moment\u2026\n\nKW: Yes!\n\nPW: I\u2019ll never forget going to you and Jay\u2019s show, and just seeing those laser lights. You addressed all the sensations, with the exception of smell and taste, I guess. Anything that you could control, the auditory and the visual, you curated \u2013 you made sure that it was a curated moment. And I\u2019ll never forget when the first bars of \u201cGotta Have It\u201d started playing, that minor chord. It just hits you anyway but it was just y\u2019all talking on top of the track as it starts to come on, and the crowd start going nuts! And it\u2019s really because at the end of the day, as great as the track is as it is and as great as all of the stuff you guys did on top of it, it was how the moment was so set up. It was like an incredible layup, an alley-oop. Do people even say that word anymore, alley-oop?\n\nKW: Yeah, it\u2019s only \u2018cause it happens\n\nPW: [laughs] yeah, you know I don\u2019t know anything about basketball, but it was an amazing set-up. That was crazy, just to see the reaction to what a visual and music could do together, and those people going absolutely crazy I was like \u201coh, ok, well done man, well done.\u201d\n\nKW: Yeah I definitely wanted to dial into that sound and mixing those textures together. I just want to dial into that more, I just want to set the note, like playing a few textures that I got for this new shit for the G.O.O.D. Music joint we opened up the album with this joint that me and Skrillex did together\n\nPW: Mmmmm. I like that!\n\nKW: Just like that!\n\nPW: Wow, I can\u2019t wait to hear what that sounds like. I know we are all shaped and moulded by all that we\u2019ve gone through, and by having spirituality \u2013 in whatever way you define it \u2013 it allows us to be bigger than our bodies, to be bigger than our essence. [But] there is something to be said for experience, being told \u201cno\u201d the entire time, when you wanted to get into an industry that you love. So let me ask you, how much has this experience contributed to who you became as a person?\n\nKW: Yeah, you know, I had to realize at what point to put off the real South Side Chicago mentality, that is what built me to deal with the amount of \u201cno\u2019s\u201d and deal with the amount of pressure and aggression, like I talked about on this Chicago song, \u201cmink is draggin\u2019 on the floor.\u201d That\u2019s one of my ideas for it [renaming \u2018Theraflu\u2019]. \u201cSwag King Cole, mink is dragin\u2019 on the floor, fo\u2019 I embarrass you, but I don\u2019t like to embarrass you\u2026\u2019I Don\u2019t Like To Embarrass You\u201d as the title\n\nPW: Anticipating PETA\n\nKW: Yeah, so\u2026when I say \u201cI\u2019m from where shorty\u2019s fucked up, double-cupped up. Might even kill some-body and YouTube it, so whoever thinks their words affect me is too stupid, and if you think you can do it better than me, then you do it.\u201d\n\nPW: Yeah, \u201cyou do it!\u201d\n\nPW: [laughs]\n\nKW: \u201cI\u2019m from Chicago.\u201d And that was just one of the best things to prepare me for anything. If you can make it out of Chicago, you can make it anywhere. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about on this new song, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about when I\u2019m dealing with any business or creative processes. That\u2019s the stuff I\u2019m talking about when I was dealing with people, from not wanting me to rap, to [not] doing the tour with Jay, and being able to do the light show for it It was like sit-ins, when we were going out to Paris. You know when we were wearing the outfits and people on the blogs were calling us names and all that, right? But then, once they got that Givenchy cover, and everybody\u2019s wearing Givenchy they\u2019re all like \u201coh this is cool.\u201d\n\nPW: Right\n\nKW: But it wasn\u2019t cool with South Park was using the photo and dissing us and everything. And so many people dress like that now\n\nPW: [Laughs in agreement] Yeah, that\u2019s what we do\n\nKW: That was before everybody said swag, or when we were out in Japan. How could you communicate through people? We\u2019re not even understanding the language but we knew the visual language, we knew the spirit, we knew the ideas, we knew the reference points\n\nPW: Yeah, that\u2019s the thing, man. That\u2019s what separates us from a lot of folk, and not because we\u2019re better but because we\u2019ve dedicated to listen to that inner voice, and a lot of people don\u2019t. A lot of people go \u201cman!\u201d they do something and they go \u201cshit you know what, and I\u2019m totally not da-da-da-da [fill in the blanks].\u201d People fail a lot of times doing that. Whereas we just trained ourselves to say \u201cyou know what, let me entertain this idea\u201d and exhaust all the possibilities to make sure that it doesn\u2019t make sense because something good may come out of that and for every time that someone has ever told you no, you\u2019ve always had that willingness to explore it. Um, and I\u2019ve watched that by the way, it\u2019s been cool to see. How are you enjoying that\u2026\n\nKW: - Enjoying what?\n\nPW: I\u2019m thinking of a way to put it\u2026How are you enjoying this whole fame thing?\n\nKW: [gasp] You know its just a process of separating things, it\u2019s understanding how to exploit it to display things, it\u2019s understanding how to exploit it to display amazing art. You know the whole trick is that I am a visual artist. To this day I can\u2019t play piano. I\u2019ve taken it up a couple of times and I forget how to play the piano. And when I first wanted to rap, before I rapped, the first thing I did was actually draw my tape covers because that\u2019s back when people had tapes. I drew the cover before I even thought about doing music. Let\u2019s put this information in Vegas to music. So ina  way I\u2019ll get the music but it was always about the fountain. It was always about the light show. It was always about the fashion show, it was always about that. Whether it is the font that we pick for a single cover, or a video \u2013 I\u2019m going to Qatar later tonight to shoot the film for \u201cCruel Summer,\u201d which is basically my second pop fairytale, like how \u201cRunaway\u201d was \u2013 it creates that kind of opportunity. When you see me design, and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the best design or whatever, but you know, [in \u201cRunaway\u201d] I had my idea of how I wanted Selita [Ebanks] to look, and I wanted it to be Selita. I wanted to juxtapose minimalist, Vanessa Beecroft like high art against unrealistic Victoria Secret-level beauty.  They don\u2019t crash, those words are not in the same place. You\u2019ve been to art parties before? It\u2019s different from a Victoria Secret\u2019s party. You know what I\u2019m talking about!\n\nPW: Right!\n\nKW: That\u2019s right. Due to exposure, I\u2019m able to have these things be seen by so many people. If Matthew Barney were more famous, then more people would see what Matthew Barney did. So it\u2019s that. When it comes down to it, what I enjoy about it is the opportunity to express art in high volume, literally\n\nPW: Did you know that you\u2019re a synesthete? That you have synesthesia?\n\nKW: That\u2019s what it\u2019s called, that\u2019s what the film is about! You\u2019re talking about seeing sounds right?\n\nPW: There are many different forms of synesthesia. There are grapheme synethetes, people who see colors in numbers, letters in colours. But I believe most musicians and most artists are synesthetes\n\nKW: You know that\u2019s what this film in Qatar is about!\n\nPW: Oh wow!\n\nKW: It\u2019s called Cruel Summer: The Legend of the Lamborghini Dons  and it\u2019s basically the G.O.O.D Music Lamborghini Dons. [Kid] Cudi, he\u2019s the main character and I\u2019m just this boy, and in the beginning we\u2019re car thieves. There\u2019s this part where one character teaches another to see colours through sound\n\nPW: Oh wow!\n\nKW: Yeah, the shit is dope. Matter of fact, if we could do work with you on the soundtrack. I mean I\u2019ve got eight tracks for it, I just want to give it twelve. Basically it\u2019s the G.O.O.D Music soundtrack that \u201cMercy\u201d is the first single for. You\u2019re like next level with this type of shit like [sings] \u201cTake me far away, as long as it\u2019s fun, fun, fun, I wanna go.\u201d I\u2019m talking to actually a film scorer at this point so \u2013\n\nPW: No! But dude\u2026.Nah man! It\u2019s funny that you picked that out [\u201cFun, Fun Fun\u201d]. That\u2019s funny, wow!\n\nKW: I play that song real normal in the car\n\nPW: No way?!\n\nKW: Yeah!\n\nPW: That\u2019s crazy, that\u2019s crazy. \u2018Aight well say no more. I\u2019mma holla at you soon. And you have a good time out there in Qatar. My man!\n\nKW: Alright, thanks! Love", "year": null}]}
