String, where the fuck is Wallace?\"\n(\"Huh? String. String. Look at me. Look at me! Where the fuck is Wallace? Huh?! I don't want this payless wearing motherfucking representing me. I'mma get my own man. Alright? So just get back in your car and get the fuck back down south.\"\n\"Alright you stupid motherfucker. You made your decision.\")"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
