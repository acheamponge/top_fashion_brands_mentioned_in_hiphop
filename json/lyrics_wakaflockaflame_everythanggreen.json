Pussy nigga, eat this trigger\nRapping ten-plus years like my name was Flocka Jigga\nDown with Brick Squad, so I gotta keep it real\nWhat's the golden rule? \"Don't be scared to kill\"\nOff a half a pill, mouth be worth a whole mill\nWe ready, but the nigga ain't Archie\nD.O.A., Waka Flocka Flame, might buy the Homi\nDead bodies by me, tell my mommy I said sorry\nTaliban-style, got my head wrapped like a mummy\nDead bodies everywhere, looking like a tsunami\n\n[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & T.O.

Green]\nGreen floors, green walls, I got green rooms\nGreen cash, green flags, I got green goons\nYou ain't getting real money like Green do\nAnd you don't get the green like Green do\nWord on the street is that I'm still that nigga\nMy nigga on green smoke your ass like a swisher\nDon't nobody really know who killed that nigga\nFeds follow when the kid liked them on Twitter\nAR-15, the clip hold fifty, nigga\nMy aim stupid, I could squeeze and kill fifty niggas\nMy boys in the hood like Doughboy and Ricky, nigga\nTry to run and bust you in your back like Ricky, nigga\n\n[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & T.O.
