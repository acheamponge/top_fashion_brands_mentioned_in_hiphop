Reign]\nThis is when magic comes out of mystery\nRealistically, I'm supposed to be history\nLocked and forgotten, buried and rotten\nI see my friends turning into foes when they heard I was popping, yeah\nThey say try to be humble when you creating something\nI say: \"Easier said than done when you young and stunting\"\nI'm never bluffing, them poker faces amount to nothing\nBreak destiny, don't forget a child like LeToya Luckett\nYoung nigga popped up around the time he got locked up\nI've been on the low, just busy raising my stock up\nTook [?] into west detention when I'm free and venting\nShe charged him extra for taking so long to pay attention\nUh, wouldn't be shit if it wasn't for Pro\nI truly owe you my life for engineering my flow\nUh, final lap and I'm gearing to go\nTell them: \"Keep the candles lit, I'm preparing to blow\"\nI sign with Sony 2014\nTime to finally put the music I had in my dope dreams\nBrutally honest, no commas I couldn't care\nIf Capito was here, he would tell you that real is rare\nI think it's safe to say it's time to ball now\nIt's getting hard to walk around the mall now\nYeah, I want it all now\nAnd to the doubters, fuck them all now\nI know they hating when they say they got me\nCause I'm in some new shit like its out to party\nProbably, probably you not me\nTwo copy, that's right you need Costco supplies and coffee\nI've been dealing with jealousy more than admiration\nNot surprised if suicide is what they contemplating\nCause to hate me you must hate yourself\nRealest niggas rate me, baddest bitches down to rape me\nA lineup of women dying to have my baby\nSpin the globe, I'ma go where the money take me\nI never interest myself in something that doesn't pay me\nThese blogs only concerned who I've been fucking lately\nJust had a daughter, baby momma buggin'\nWell think about it, the rumors would bother any woman\nHard to predict the future, it's getting cloudy\nGuess things change and not just anybody\n\n[Verse 2: P. Reign]\nOn a brighter note, my daughter is so special\nLaying on my chest shining, she's my gold medal\nWish she never change, but I know better\nSo bought a pistol like I dope peddle\n\n[Verse 3: P. Reign]\nDon't ring my doorbell, that girl daddy will kill\nBad boys two nigga, Martin and Will\nIn Canada alone probably seeing a mil\nSo I exclude to my country, became part of my deal\nHard enough proving my city got hoods in it\nLike them trees got wood in them\nThey used to diss a country, now they say we next\nI know crack sellers that made a fortune off DMX\nIll life, because its hard to keep it bottled in\nIf you want me, come get me\nJust look for the phone call with yellow cabs following\nThat's the goons I don't allow them to drive with the semis, yeah\nMe and my mother we don't speak much\nIt hurts\nSo devastated about devorcin' from my pops that she lost sight of what matters in life\nIt's sad to say but my mama needs church\nHow a counselor need counseling\nDespite our past, you'll never see a check bounce again\nNow somebody bring my accountant in\nType of bread you would break a sweat when you counting it\nI fought the few from the [?] [?]\nLet's not forget\nI offered you and [?] [?]\nWritten in blood on my body\nTattooed on my heart\nATFO is the family, I did shit in my past\nJust to prove that I'm bout it\nSee my son never shot one when I was loading that shottie\nGot me?\nNever prove yourself to niggas with nothing to lose\nAnd don't ever trust the nigga in multiple crews\nIf it's anything but ill, you must have me confused\nIll life for the life, it's time that I choose\nYeah", "year": "2015-12-03"}]}
