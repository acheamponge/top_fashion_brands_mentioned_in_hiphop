I remember this one birthday, it was actually when I turned 21\nAnd um.. this boy wanted to take me out and I was like 'Oh, okay'\nHe was in the military and stuff so.. it's cute\nAnd.. he told me we was gonna get tacos, I love tacos\nWe was gonna go to San Francisco for it\nSo I drive out to meet him and we drive out to San Francisco, it's all good\nAnd I'm like, 'Oh okay, so where we gonna get tacos?'\nAnd he's like, 'I just figured we'd just find a place'\nAnd I was like, 'So you have no plan' So then, he was like\n'Well, let's go to California Pizza Kitchen' And I'm like\n'That's not tacos, like.. you said we were gonna get tacos, where's tacos?'\nSo we go to California Pizza Kitchen, it's so.. whatever, like.. okay\nAnd then he's like, 'Okay, so now we're gonna go out'\nAnd I'm like, 'What you mean we're goin out??' This nigga takes me to a club\nOn my birthday, and I wasn't like prepared for a club, I don't like clubs!\nSo we go into this club, it's WILD expensive to be so damn empty\nAnd it's full of like, Asians, who aren't dancing! And that's it!\nAnd so, he's tryin to get me to drink all these drinks that I don't want\nCause I already told him I don't drink, so he gets upset\nHe's like pissed at me for the rest of the night cause I wasn't drinking\nAnd so then we leave and he's like leaving me down the block\nIn San Francisco in the middle of the night, we get in his car\nAnd we're on the freeway driving back and he plays 2Pac - the WHOLE way!\nLike turned all the way up! I guess, to let me know he was upset\nHehe! I was like 'Are you KIDDING me??!' So that was my 21st birthday\""}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
