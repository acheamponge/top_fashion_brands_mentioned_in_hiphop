The illest\nTo all my niggas who been shitted on, let's get it on\nDick, I'm gonna let it hang and sit it on\nThe desk of any redneck record exec\nI strike 'em with the right hand, send 'em a step\nAnd this is\n\n[Chorus]\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\n\n[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]\nHell, incest kids under pressure\nIn the corner clutching their genitals by the dresser\nA hundred CCs of the uncut cleanest\nIn the vein, twenty-four hours of intravenous\nTo the left, we have right-wing extremists\nOn a screen, a man exposes his breasts with no penis\nMy team is probably just as raw as Lady Saw and Chaka Demus is\n\n[Chorus]\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\nHell (this is)\n\n[Bridge]\nThis is, this is, this is, this is\nThis is, this is, this is, this is\n\n[Verse 3: Canibus]\nYo, yo, I feel like I'm one of the livest\nOne of hip-hop's finest elite rhymers\nAnd I plan to graduate with honors\nBut one day, we'll all be a bunch of old-timers with Alzheimer's\nLooking at our label's roster\nWondering how the fuck they forgot us\nAfter we done recorded dozens of albums\nAnd made 'em hundreds of thousands of dollars, they still dropped us\nWe giving niggas what the fuck they want\nA Holocaust, stomping niggas with a thousand-man march\nI ain't living in hell, hell's living in me\nThat's why I'm always screaming on you fucking MCs\nThe shit that I quote, float with the buoyancy of a boat\nWith the potency of a scorpion sting to the throat\nOverdose that's extremely fatal\nDoctors in white lab coats scramble for an antidote to save you\nYou can't breathe, your chest feels painful\nYour skin color's going from dark brown to beige-blue\nYour whole room is full of angels\nAll in your ear trying to tell you which God you should pray to\nYou pray to Je-sus, but he don't wanna save you\n'Cause you unfaithful, so he gives you to Azazel\nYou're paralyzed on the operating table\nPraying for Canibus to slice you from head to navel\nYou banned from TV, banned from CDs\nBanned from DVDs and downloadable MP3s", "year": "1999-10-19"}]}
