I just came back from overseas.\"\nAnd while she out here tryna fuck for a buck\nI got this other bitch tryna fuck for a truck\n\n[Hook] x2\nShawty wanna be a model\nShe on the internet going full throttle\nShawty wanna be a model\nShe on the internet going full throttle\n\n[Verse 2]\nBad bitch from Brazil, spoke Portuguese\nShe might even let you crack her if you worth some cheese\nOut in Ibiza, we smoking trees\nAin't paying for that ho pussy, paying that ho to leave\nDon't get me misunderstood, yes the pimping is good\nGot a bitch in the 'burbs, got a bitch in the hood\nLegs up, hit it from the front door\nGave her a encore and she still want more\nThis bitch talking 'bout take her out to eat on me\nMy Cali bitches got that EBT, they eat for free\nAin't nothing better than good food and crazy dome\nShe said fuck that R&B, go throw that Jay-Z on\nLong as her hair together, long as her purse is Lou\nNighttime stripper, daytime nursing school\nShe put her favorite song on and ripped them clothes off\nTold her girl to film on the iPhone while she goes off\n\n[Hook] x2"}]}
