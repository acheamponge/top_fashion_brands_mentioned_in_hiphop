Making preteens laugh for the money\nAct dumb, slicker than honey, whoops!\nRapping in the kitchen but got no silver spoon\nBut I feed on the bitches, bitches\nMotherfuckers want to act funny\n\n[Chorus]\nOne bad chef\nIn a kitchen full of dough\nThree bad bitches with their hands on the stove\nMaking home movies with a hand full of stoges\nI'm cooking all the dumplings\nI'm cooking all the dumplings", "year": "2017-05-24"}]}
