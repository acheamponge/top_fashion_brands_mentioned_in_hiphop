Spraying on you roaches\nThe AK is an animal, it is ferocious\nA nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest\nWatch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus\nRing, ring, a nigga won't sing\nRing, ring, I keep that bitch clean\nRing, ring a nigga won't sing\n'Less he is an insomniac, he'll die in a dream\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nYou can tell I went to school on a small yellow bus\nNever bothered me, strong arm robbery\nI went from powdered jelly donuts to taking them Os\nFrom my high school sweetheart to fucking with hoes\nLook, I\u2019m all grown up and I done blown up\nNigga, ain't much changed; in fact, things are the same\nI\u2019m the definition of shooter, gun of choice, the Ruger\nYou\u2019ll take my word for it or make me do it to ya\nI\u2019m a magnet to murder, when I\u2019m in the mood\nGet convicted through the forensics when you walk in my shoes\nI\u2019m bad news, you niggas know the verdict, I\u2019m filthy\nDrop Phantom is milky, white on white\n24 inch blades, I'm skatin'\nRed eyes, smoking that bomb shit, I'm Satan\nNigga, surprise, 50 back on fire\n50 back running round this bitch strapped, hitman for hire\n\n[Hook: Pharrell]\nIt\u2019s like Raid!

Man, that ship sailed\nTake a breath and head back if that shit failed\nDrop weight like an anchor; then, you set sail\nHell freeze over like the watch I put the sleeve over\nEngine devil-scream when I turn the key over\nPirellis on the street rolling like a steamroller\nBitches double-team when I have my sleepovers\nYuugh! Re-Up Gang with the G-Unit\nThis is tailor-made, drug dealer theme music\nTest it on your tongue or either watch a fiend do it\nI got you hooked and I laugh as you lean to it\n\n[Hook: Pharrell]\nIt\u2019s like Raid! Spraying on you roaches\nThe AK is an animal, it is ferocious\nA nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest\nWatch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus\nRing, ring, a nigga won't sing\nRing, ring, I keep that bitch clean\nRing, ring a nigga won't sing\n'Less he is an insomniac he'll die in a dream", "year": "2011-03-21"}]}
