8th grade\nIn the small old town where the two both stayed\nHe came from a family of middle class\nWhere everything he did he always had to ask\nShe came from a place that was so alone\nYou know the same old tail of a broken home\nHer momma was an alkie (sp?) and more like a friend\nHad three different kids from three different men\nAnd that's just the way s*** was\nCouldn't change it couldn?t rearrange it so there it was\nAnyway the two kept on\nWith the phone calls notes and so on and so on\nAnd after the bulls*** and whatten\nThat day came the two started f***in'\nAll the time you know kids habit's\nEvery single day f***in' like rabbits\nSneakin out the car when he was 15\nClimbin' in the window and f***in' all night see\nF***in' after lunch in the junior high bathrooms\nDrinking champagne and trippin' on mushrooms\nHis d*** was metal her p**** was a magnet\n9th grade came ?I'm pregnant?\nS*** got frantic and man oh Lord it was a tuff decision\nBut they decided to abort it\nIt might have been right it might have been wrong\nBut one thing's for sure it really f***ed his head up\nWhere is it who is it how is it was it right\nThese are the things he thought in bed at night\nA lot of people might laugh at this\nBut f*** 'em they don't know the half of it\nAin't no sunshine when you're low\nI'm low\nPeople tell me life's a game I'm not playin'\nB****es don't mean s*** to me anymore\nI have taken my blows I'm still standin'\nNow as time went on the the two kept on\nThey kept seeing each other off and on\nSee she moved to the city and you know what happened\nBlack chick with a real whiteaccent\nPretty girl in the ghetto go figure\nYeah she got macked by some dope dealin' nigga\nStill seein' that other kid on the side\nShe kept most of her thoughts inside\nSee all the first guy did was just love her\nWhile that punk mother f***er used to beat her and punch her\nShe was livin' all wild\nI think all she ever wanted was the love of her own child\nShe asked the first guy to have his baby\nHe looked at her like she must be crazy\nHe was makin' records and goin' on tour\n20,000 people hip hoppin on the floor\nAnd all that while she sat at home and got macked\nIf she stepped out of line she got slapped\nAnd then one day she prayed to the Lord to take that guy away\nAnd he did he got caught with a loaded gun\nAnd went to jail but first she had his son\nOoohh and now what to do\nShe had no man no money and no clue\nNow the other guy came back from tourin'\nAnd she called him up early one mornin'\nThey hooked up her mind was blown\nAs he began to raise her son as his own\nAnd that's a lot of s*** to deal with man\nAnd if you ain't been there you wouldn't understand\nAnd people still laugh at this s***\nF*** 'em they don't know the half of it\nAin't no sunshine when you're low\nI'm low\nPeople tell me life's a game I'm not playin'\nB****es don't mean s*** to me anymore\nI have taken my blows I'm still standin'\nNow for the next year there was some good times\nA few bad times mostly good times\nSee he was a ramblin' man to the bone\nHe liked women and wine and he loved to roam\nNot like she was any kind of Saint\nSee in this story there's a lot of red paint\nBut time kept slippin' and made her crazy\nAnd she talked about havin' another baby\nThe guy was like ooh Lord\nWe got one now that we can't afford\nBut she convinced she could handle two\nSaid I want your child or I'm you\nI can't figure out why then he didn't run\nI guess he was attached to her and her son\nAll confused about what to do\nThat girl met another guy and was f***in' him too\nSlut\nCould barely pay her rent\nAnd then the same old s*** ?I'm pregrant?\nAnd if that ain't some s*** cuz\nThe girl didn't even know who the father was\nAnd still by her side the first guy stayed\nHead gettin' more f***ed by the day\nHe stuck it out for nine months I don't know why\nAnd then a little girl on the Fourth of July\nWas born in the front seat of his car\nIt was amazing\nKinda like a shooting star\nHe was happy told his family and friends\nOnly to realize later his little girl wasn't his\nAnd that crushed him quick\nSuicidal thoughts were in his head real thick\nBut before he found all that out\nFrom the same chick another kid popped out\nAnd that s***'s real ill\nGirl told him that she was takin' the f***in' pill\nShe must have known all along\nThe little girl wasn't his and she was tryin' to latch on\nThree different kids from three different men\nHistory repeats itself again\nAnd after some more s*** got stirred\nHe kicked that b**** to the curb\nAnd now from her he's got a little boy that makes him laugh a bit\nAnd he loves him\nBut still you don?t know the f***in' half of it\nAin't no sunshine when you're low\nI'm low\nPeople tell me life's a game I'm not playin'\nB****es don?t mean s*** to me anymore\nI have taken my blows I'm still standin'\nI'm still standin'\nI'm still standin'\nI'm still standin'"}]}
