I was out of control\nGot bagged 8 to 10, with 3 to serve at [?]\nMy life was no joke\nAt about this time, pop duke caught a stroke\nMy life and my dreams all went up in smoke\nToo damn strong to hang myself by a rope\nOne day in my cell feeling blue\nI got a kite from my main man, Guru\nHe told me what to do\nHe said if you get your shit right, there's a chance for you\nRight then, it hit me like a metal pipe\nI'ma rock mics for the rest of my life\nNo longer will my mind be cluttered\nI was able to make it without my father or my mother\nBut I love them still\nAnd if they stay together, my life might not be ill\nBut you got to do what you got to do\nAnd for the rest of my fam, this one's for you\nYeah\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Big Shug"}
