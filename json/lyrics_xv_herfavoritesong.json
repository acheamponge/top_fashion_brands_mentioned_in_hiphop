If I try, say you want it\nPut a nine with a bullet, to my mind and just pull it\nCause I'd have to be blind on my side, Sandra Bullock\nMy phone jail broken, that's a cell with no bars\nAnd I don't even know where I are\nTrying to get some cut, you want to get lit\nSo I'm talking shit like a barber at a bar\nNiggas ask, \"Where your man?\", you say, \"Very far\"\nThey ask for direction, you point to the stars\nSo much space in between the space bar\nFuck it, tell them, \"Clear the way, I'm about to take off\"\nAnd she goes...\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge: XV]\nPut on your iTunes and sing for me\nSpray my cologne and put on my T for me\nWhen I'm gone, I know you dream of me\n(Her heart beats like drums for me)\nPut on your iTunes and sing for me\nSpray my cologne and put on my T for me\nPut your titties up on the screen for me\nWhen I'm gone, I know you dream of me\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "XV"}
