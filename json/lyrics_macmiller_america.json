High, more drinkin'\nNow my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?\nPain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source\nBear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list\nTry to understand the fuckin' message I encrypted\nAncient, halucinatin' visions of utopia\nUntil I figure out that the perfect world a lonely one\nNever hold my tongue, vocal as a loaded gun\nAnd I'ma shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run\nMac Miller, I'm the only one\nBut I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium\n\n[Hook: Mac Miller]\nGot my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split\nHand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public\nWelcome to America\nMotherfucker, welcome to America\nMy middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split\nHand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public\nWelcome to America\nMotherfucker, welcome to America\n\n[Verse 2: Mac Miller]\nStill, in a room filled with holographic images\nCrushin' information into powder, then I'm sniffin' it\nDirectly to my head, never sleep or use my bed\nIller than the future death of you ingestin' Sudafed\nMight head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest\nHop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress\nSee, this is what I do the best\nNothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest\nSave hard, a Braveheart, a warrior\nI take part to stay far from coroners\nI heard some corny words said about my music though\nTalkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho\nMost Dope, got you hooked, yellin' Ruffio\nFirst you lose your mind, then you lose your soul\nSo what you talkin' about? thinkin' you're out of options\nAmerican born, impeccable form above and beyond, never the norm\n\n[Hook: Mac Miller]\nGot my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split\nHand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public\nWelcome to America\nMotherfucker, welcome to America\nMy middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split\nHand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public\nWelcome to America\nMotherfucker, welcome to America\n\n[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]\nYo chick live in Pittsburgh? Bet I steal her\nShout out my wigga Mac Miller, comin' up in a world full of killers\nI'll be shaded up at the villa\nWith a girl that know what the deal is\nThey don't know I come from the illest\nCity on the map, we don't know how to act, ahh!\nRealest young rappin go getters in America\nBad chick get tossed around like the merry go\nCV and Mac meezy takin' off on PJ's\nWe the future so every night is a new day\nSittin' in the studio, chain on and my hat low\nYoung visionaries and we sellin' out the rap show\nI can trigger the wave in my sleep\nName paved, I feel like I am engraved on the beat\nWake up shower, get paid and repeat\nSpit one flow and got made on the streets\nWelcome to the land where you never stay for free\nSwag worth a mill, drop cast let it deal\nVeggies\n\n[Hook: Mac Miller]\nGot my middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split\nHand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public\nWelcome to America\nMotherfucker, welcome to America\nMy middle finger up with a cup and a dutch split\nHand on my nuts when I'm wilin' out in public\nWelcome to America\nMotherfucker, welcome to America\n\n[Verse 4: Joey Bada$$]\nBout to drop hot shit, runnin' out of patience, niggas not sick\nRollin' up the dankest loud, plane goin' mach 6\nRise to the top, the topics change\nThe Glocks in the Stock Exchange\nNow watch the price of life on the block drop, insane\nYou can't stop this reign, don't name drop in vain\nInhale toxic flames from tropic strains, it's awkward strange\nLast week he was nothin', boxers stain\nNow everybody love him and chicks offer top for fame\nTo the top I aim, testin' waters so I've been afloat\nNo deal but flow so real, he been in the scopes\nSun got shine, now they say he shady but he never dippin' though\nStill facing L's, you would think a nigga's wins was low\nWhat you think I'm in this for?\nWon't stop 'til the nigga who invented dope\nEnd the flow or behind bars droppin' prison soap\nBegging for forgiveness, but it's business though\nI'm record spittin' Guinness flows\nGot it up in sources now he in the store\n\n[Outro: Sample]\nPeople are just uptight because the kids are having fun and they didn't have the same freedom because they didn't take it, they just followed the lines laid down by their parents", "year": "2012-03-13", "album": "Macadelic", "title": "America"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
