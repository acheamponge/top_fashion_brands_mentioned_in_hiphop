Coyote, man super genius\nAgainst all odds like Serena and Venus\nI only had a couple jobs in my life, but not too many thought I was grown\nWho woulda thought I'd sell my skill for a microphone\nAnd be rappin' about it up in the song, slidin' on some chrome\n\nIt's long money I earn, I'm bald headed, but I used to have a Lord Jesus perm\nWhen my name was earl before the rap game\nRunnin' from secret squirrel, I had my own thang\nRaised by wolves, hyenas, and barracudas, gorillas and bulls\n\n[Chorus]\nI play the field like Vick\nFrom endzone to endzone\nServe that ish like snowcones in the hood\nEntrenched in the gutter, I was lost in the good\n'cause I make the gat stutta like a old G should\nMamas lookin', so much snookin'\nNights in the kitchen thought I'd never finish cookin'\nWay before pay for this that I'm mouthin'\n\n19 years young, upward of 80 thousand\nTrust me young'n Pusha was never browsin' for nothin' section 8 housin'\nI'm stompin' through like King Kong claimin' his home, his jungle\nMumblers beware the hood hates singers\nI connect, block the corner like Jenga, fall never, you seen 'em\nPosted in the hood leanin' fiends like the Tower of Pisa\nDamn he's good\n\n[Chorus: 2X]\nNow of course you know I ain't talkin' about sports\nI'm talkin' about runnin some shit\nI'm talkin' about workestratin' and illustratin'\nGlorifyin' ya paper route\n\nWhether it serve it to, uh..\nGettin' out there hustlin', grittin' and grindin'\nDoin' ya thug-thizzlemajiggadale\nQuarterbackin' man, hustlin' main\nTrust that main, yeah, in real life main\nSome call it pitchin', some call it grindin'\nWe call it Quarterbackin'\nYeah, and I ain't talkin' about sports, trust that"}], "artist": "Clipse"}
