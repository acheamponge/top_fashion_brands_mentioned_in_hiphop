Slim Thugger's, what they call me\nAll the young G's, give me they respect\nCause I made it out the hood, and a nigga living good\nBut I still, look out for my set\nAll the chicks, wanna be in my presence\nJust to witness all the riches, and the power\nThey never seen a young teen, grow up to be a king\nGetting what they make in a year, in a hour\nAll the while, I don't let the cash impress me\nCause I've been a young hustler, from the start\nIt's just all my hard work, slowly paying off\nCause God knows, I'm a hustler in the heart\nSee I never let the money, or fame change me\nYou can still catch Slim, in the streets\nAnd even though I rap now, still keep a strap now\nTucked up, under the seat\nSo all I gotta say, to you wanna-be gonna-be\nDick sucking, motherfucking prankstas\nWhen the shit goes down, what the fuck you gon do\nDamn it feels good, to be a gangsta\n\n(*talking*)\nYeah, we take pride in what we do\nAnd personally I'd like to describe myself, as a nobody though\nYou feel me, I don't give a fuck what you do my nigga\nWhatever you do take pride in it you feel me, feel good\n\n[Yung Ro]\nDamn it feel good, to be a nobody\nWell respected, you can call me Yung Ro\nYou see my name ring bells, from movies to doing flows\nBut I still, got so far to go\nSo I keep on grinding, with my head up\nAnd realize, I done came a long way\nBut my mind's on the future, and my future's unpredictable\nI can't stay crunk, about today\nSo behind all the fame, and the lime light\nI'm bout bidness, everyday of the week\nCause I got people depending on me, and they can't understand\nHow I can come home, without food to eat\nBut when I'm grinding, and I'm tired of it all\nTelling God I'm sick and tired, of this place\nIt ain't a feeling in this world, that can compare to the look\nOf appreciation, on my mama's face\nSo I hold it down, for my T. Lady\nMy kin folk, and my niggas on the block\nRight boogie when I can, and send 'em words of inspiration\nCause I know, it get hard on lock\nSo when I come to your city, doing shows mayn\nShow love, when you see me fall through\nJust holla nobody, and I swear I'll holla back\nCause that's how, real nobody's do\nNow throw your set in the air, if you gang bang\nAffiliated, or just love the hood\nCould give a fuck where you from, if you real it's one hundred\nThat's my word homie, it's all good\nSo when you hear me on a song, screaming nobody\nYou gotta know what it mean, to be a nobody\nTo say nobody, huh g'yeah\nDamn it feel good, to be a nobody", "title": "Feels Good to be a Gangsta"}]}
