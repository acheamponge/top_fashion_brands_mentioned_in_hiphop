Nah ain't like none of 'em\nFuck the 5-0, I'm lighting hydro\nYou can tell me about the bisso but what I know\nCause on the street there ain't none of this industry\nUntil I brang it to the industry like this is me\nRespect me for that, it's all I really ask for\nAnd we be getting raided by a fucking task force\nFor years now they went and locked my mates up\nMy money clean but they still won't go away fuck!\n\n[Hook]\nForever in my mind, only you\nThe pieces in my life, go away with you\nForever in my mind, only you\nThe pieces in my life, run away with you\nForever in my...\n\n[Verse 2]\nNothing changed but my attitude man\nMake cash when I had a new plan\nKids looking up to me, what the fuck am I meant to say?\nIts not as hard as it was for me\nThey shut the door but I kicked it in, I come for more\nThey knock you down you won't get help\nRise to the top tell 'em fuck yourself\nCause they gonna hate you when you poor as shit\nThey look, they laugh, ignore your shit\nAnd you gonna feel down you'll wanna quit\nBut you gotta fucking fight if you want the shit\nAnd you're at the top its not as sick as you pictured it what's wrong with This\nWhy people turn my mates have changed\nWhy you thinking shit would stay the same\nStupid man I'm trying to guide the next Kerser\nBut Imma tryna hide from all the shit that comes with rap\nBack on the street with a baggy dacked\nCause the fame ain't sunk in yet (the fame ain't sunk in yet)\nIn a brand new car I think the fame has fucked my head\nBut gotta keep control and run this shit\n100k another 100 flip\nEver doubt me you can suck my dick\nI ain't even know what a budget is\nFuck the scene, have your hip-hop\nSkitsing out you got me pissed off\nAin't no love my heart is switched off\nGot my back well fuck I guess not\n\n[Hook]\nForever in my mind, only you\nThe pieces in my life, go away with you\nForever in my mind, only you\nThe pieces in my life, run away with you\nForever in my..."}], "artist": "Kerser"}
