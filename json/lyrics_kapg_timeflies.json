(Cash)\nI pray tomorrow gets better, no more bad news. (Bad)\nHow they gonna go smile in your face and then go bash you\nSo many scars from the lies, they like tattoos\n\n[Verse]\nAin't got no time for catching feelings, I rather catch flights\nAnd if I'm taking off the ceiling, then I'm running all the lights\nWe after 12 like its midnight\nI don't know what fake feel like\nMy neck yeah that real ice\nSome things that I realize\nThis shit just don't feel right\nI got problems in real life\nI act like it's all right\nRegardless I live life\n\n[Bridge]\nWalk around with it, but you ain't gon' squeeze\nSome of my dogs in prison and they can't go free\nEvery day Thanksgiving, I keep macs on me. (and cheese)\nI know I've been sinning, ya'll pray for me\n\n[Hook]\nWe do whatever for the cheddar, know that cash rules. (Cash)\nI pray tomorrow gets better, no more bad news. (Bad)\nHow they gonna go smile in your face and then go bash you\nSo many scars from the lies, they like tattoos\nI told my jeweler [?] the rollie, that's how time flies\nI'm probably fucking on your bitch on your timeline\nI get caught doing the right thing, at the wrong the time\nI swear those people will change on you, for those dead guys"}], "artist": "Kap G"}
