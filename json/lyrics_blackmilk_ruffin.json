What you playin' it for?\nWhere you trynna hang out yo we hang at the store\nNiggas playin' the law till they lay in the morgue\nIt's that dirt rap\nGhetto DMF where they ask where the work at\nEastside strip clup ghetto bitches twerk at\nDon't sleep you might catch a dirt nap\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nOff the books and shit\nOn record, off record off the hook and shit\nTook this shit\nI still rep it ain't nothin'\nInner city still betray Dave Ruffin\nRugged and uh, say somethin' we stay dumpin'\nAny place they hear the bass we keep the place jumpin'\nYeah the city where they got the hot gun ray\nSay fuck laws, 911 calls but the cops come late\nBut now we recording while fans waitin'\nCame from bus stations recording in mom's basement\nDidn't have a dime and couldn't go buy a Nathan\nNow I only spend my time with dime faces\n\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Black Milk"}
