Keep you guessing\nConstant stressing, only talkin' about lettuce and dressing\n\nFuck That! I was on the bottom like fat chicks\nAnd now the worlds on top of where my sack is\nOr they ask where the cash is\nThey say rap is only for black kids\nRappin' about Racks, to me, Nordstrom's is where that is\n\nFire on the mic, leave you all ashy\nI just run this shit like a track meet\nAs for the promise ring, boy don't ask me\nCause now we're in the back seat, no taxi\nBut at least you now know she isn't classy\n\nThe listeners admire, your girl prespires\nYour songs drag on (dragon), I spit fire\nI need to aquire my desires when the situation's dire\nI will never tire, or become a liar, Frost\n\nShe on my wiener like sauerkraut\nSpittin' harder than a llama mouth\nThe kid can truely rap, and besides common doubt\nFrost isn't a lost cause because I'm hotter than a sauna now\n\nYou ain't never real, Amish Online Dating\nIf you're hot bitch, I'm 10 degrees past Satan"}]}
