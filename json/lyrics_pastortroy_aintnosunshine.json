Grab your popcorn\nAin't no more sunshine\n\nYeah\nAin't no sunshine down here\nThe sun don't even shine down here\nPut yourself in my shoes\nNigga imagine being in a place where the sun don't ever shine\nThat's where I'm at\n\n[Verse 1]\nCome on, O.K., peep it\nMy Tec swing low like sweet chariots\nBust him and bury him\nDeath be his fate, we sending flowers to they wake\nAnd crying at they wake\nAnd mourning with these motherfuckers' mother\nBut plotting out a way to kill they brother\nAnother nigga bled another nigga's gone be bleeding\nCuz I ain't trynna hear that shit this evening\nY'all niggas best believe in guerilla warfare\nThere's people cross the cemetery, how they get there\nI tell ya, was this nigga from Lake Olmstead\nMy nigga said that he been fucking up dope since day one\nSo instead of pumping the shit in Olmstead\nI suggest he take that stupid shit to Sunset\nBut naw, but naw, he wants to play bad Billy Bad Ass and shit\nA flaw in my game, like I can't perform the hit\nI threw on the fucking plastic bag, wrapped my hands\nAround his ass and squeezed, till the nigga can't breath\nNibbling cheese up out my trap\nHow the fuck I'mma catch the mouse\nIf you bumping ya gums and steady running ya mouth\nBut down south I ain't no hard ass nigga\nBut best believe if thrill come to thriller, motherfucker I feel ya\nFlash them hollow points cuz hollow points get points across\nThey want the juice, but they dont want to pay the cost\nNow who's the boss, my nigga ask these hoes\nI'm nuttin in they mouth and they nose\nThey eyes if they ain't closed\nThe lifestyle that I chose, who knows, may make me rich\nBut if them feds kick down them doors then life's a bitch\nI'm sitting in the patty wagon thinking bout the snitch\nAnd with my phone call, I know exactly who to hit\nMy niggas on Perry, we got some bodies to bury\nBust them niggas with rugers and hide them lugers with Karie\nNow it's very necessary that this bid go through\nBecause we already know how niggas do\nAin't no motherfuckin sunshine\n\n[Chorus - 2x]\nAin't no motherfuckin sunshine, it's only Tec-9's and clips\nAnd niggas that's equipped for whatever\nI thought you knew better but you still ran your mouth\nNow you runnin from them fuckin Georgia Boys from Down South\n\n[Verse 2]\nAin't no sunshine my nigga, the sun ain't gonna shine\nTill I reach about a million, talking business with Brazilians\nI got this funny feeling that I'm gone be filthy rich\nAnd I'm gone marry money cuz money's a faithful bitch\nIf it ain't one thing its ten more, fuck another\nSurrounded by undercovers, every time they speak they stutter\nMy mind be in the gutter, but thats how I burn the house\nJust cuz I try to prove what these pussy niggas bout\nThese niggas make me shout, yea they frustrate me\nBecause I sell dope, I guess thats why these niggas hate me\nMake me recall, think it was the fall of '96\nBut time don't matter niggas doing the same shit\nThe narcs is bout to hit, his habit made him tell\n\"Officer of the law,\" bastard crooked as hell\nThey lookin for Terell, mixed him up with Darrell\nIt's two Darrells, they hit they door with Marquel\nRinging em on the cell, told my niggas time to bail\nThey knew we shot them niggas they just lookin for the shells\nThey trying they best to nail, like Nell gimme a break\nUs Cooley High niggas, us niggas is hard to take\nWe appreciate they bust\nWe appreciate they threat\nWe appreciate that we so smooth that they ain't caught us yet\nNow Karie want respect, claim I'm doing her wrong\nBut my name is not Rome, I don't know where I belong\nPumping her up with these songs so so-long till all police\nGet O.U.T., but first let me get my things\nTold her to bring me the box with the lock that she was holding\nShe brought my shit downstairs, my fucking box was open\nI'm holding my breath before I mothafuckin hurt her\nRambling through my shit, no shells from the murder\nI asked her calmly, \"Where the fuck is my shit\"\n(\"Troy thats all I had\")\n\"What the fuck you mean bitch\"\nIt should have been six empty bullets and my ruger\nFuck trynna explain, pop her, had to shoot her\nI knew that the murders would interfere with my grinding\nBut what the fuck you expect if the sun ain't shining\n\n[Chorus - 2x]\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy mind is fucked up, I keep on picturing Karie's head jerking\nDisturbing me while I'm working\nIt's clouds lurking over me, like a cartoon\nToo hot on the streets, I got to stay in my room\nSoon to be charged 3 murders 7 counts\nA one-sentence will: \"Quinzo, I leave a ounce.\"\nYo burn for your nigga, bout to go visit my brother\nIt's back to Atlanta, shit too hot in Augusta\nI knew I shouldn't have trust her, thinking bout her ass\nBout 3 or 4 knocks at my door and who is that\nJust that fast, niggas done ran off in my shit\nSki masks and guns and they shooting to hit\nI ran upstairs to get my gat yea that mac\nI'm running and ducking one grazed me cross my back\nBut then I reached my gat, payback, I'm bustin rockets\nRan back to the stairs threw two clips off in my pockets\nHis gun I heard him cock it I went to busting over there\nI'm poppin on them pussy niggas--die, nigga! yea!\nI popped one in his ear, told him I didn't fear nothing\nSnatched the mask up off the nigga, and it's damn Karie's cousin\nThen I rushed into the bathroom, then turned off the lights\nI heard somebody's footsteps approaching to my right\nNow bullets taking flight, I'm bustin in all directions\nI laid in the tub praying for my protection\nThe hit was to perfection, I was fucked up in the game\nWhile laying in the tub I heard them niggas calling my name\nMy 6'3\" frame to be filled with bullet holes\nIf I gotta leave, some more of them has gots to go\nI ran back to the stairs and went the busting with mine\nAt some bastards Tec-9, but they laid in line\nAnd I was fine\nShit went to the phone to call Greg\nBoom, Boom. Done took two to the head\n\nIt ain't no fuckin sunshine!", "year": null}]}
