county fighting quadruple bodies\nBut when he beat it, we in Egypt, need a newer hobby\nHe beat his robbery, went back faster than a Maserati\nEverybody in the race, I'm tryna cop Bugatti's\nLost my Sky Dweller, yeah, but ain't nobody rob me\nWe'll come shoot up the party, ain't no Lodi Dodi\nI got niggas calling my phone from the federales\nTold me niggas breaking bad, ain't sent him 20 dollars\nI remember breaking bread with like 20 heads\nImagine me behind the walls for like 20 years\nFeeling like I'm dead, I couldn't even make my bed\nI ain't have no spread\nProject still 10 toes bitch and only got 1 leg\nNiggas only had 1 life to live, never got no bread\nCan't think back on his decisions now he ain't got no head\nNiggas don't really be clapping that lead\nYeah, really be scared\nMy niggas gon' hop out killing instead\nMake sure you cover them dreads\nYou in the streets better cover your tracks\nYou can't talk to that hoe when you going to bed\nWonder how you end up shot in the back\nSame way she was for you, that hoe going again\nNext thing you know that hoe going again\nYeah gone with the wind\nBitches don't know when I'm calling again\nNext week I'm all in her friends\n.40 Glock all in my drawers again\nTo walk through the mall again\nI made 50 songs, had to ball again\nBitch go leak em all again\nI'm making songs like Future, I got a future\nAnd I be up with the roosters\nFuck niggas really be losers, really be using\nThats why I'm dolo as usual\nAnd that's why I tote my own pole with the shooters\nI can't be in this shit snoozing\nIf a nigga ain't shooting he ducking or running\nAnd I can't be in this shit choosing\nI remember I used to just play with a 100\nThen graduated to 2's\nI remember I used to just bag up them onions\nThen graduated to moving\nAnd really my life is a movie\nReal diamonds and gold in my jewerly\nIf you think you gon' make it, nigga come take it\nIt do not matter, got Uzi's\nTold my Jeweler to make it, 80 point bracelet\nNow ain't no wonder she naked\nTold lil bro to get closer to knock off his face\nCuz we don't get niggas mistaken\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah we fry niggas like bacon\nWe find niggas like Taken\nI'm from 0-7-9\nI'm dropping 5's\nAnd I'm still slamming the rake's\nStill grippin four nickels and S 550's\nThis what ima slide on the jakes in\nThey can't catch me cuz them squad cars basic\nMe and foenem up in our cars racing\nAin't no pulling over, so we in hot cars daily\nAnd we ain't instagraming shit, ain't no HaHa Davis\nI got the gun with the light and the laser\nI live my life and the light is amazing\nI used to lean on a lot of the lazy\nI would just lay back literally lettin her lick me\nShe did it long like my lady\nI think her name was Lindsey, Lala, Lisa, Laura\nI'll get with her later\nBut I know I'm gon get this to this paper\nYeah I gotta get to the guap\nIf I don't ima get on a caper\nSoon as I used to get on the block\nPolice tryna give a nigga the vapor\nWhy they thinkin I'm gettin niggas knocked off\nI'm somewhere way out here in Jamaica\nNow I'm gettin a nigga knocked right off the map\nCuz' my paper major\nEveryday of my life I talk to Cap\nHe said don't go to no major\nSo I ain't go to no major\nStill get major paper\nAin't got no events, we hit a 100 bands\nI been fucking hoes that had another man\nSee 2 50's on the weekend, that was running in\nWe still counting rolls, traveling for shows\n30 in bulk, 20 and 30 a show\nAin't' fucking no dirty hoes\nNo I ain't broke no more\nMy mama don't live in the hood no more\nI ain't in the hood no more\nI barely pop out in the hood no more\nAnd it ain't even worth it no more\nNah I ain't working no more\nI ain't tryna blow 30s no more\nYou can't see me in person no more\nI ain't just Lil Herbie no more\nYeah, I ain't just Lil Herbie no more\nA lot of shit ain't worth it no more\nCan't see me in person no more\nNah I ain't working no more\nThem lil disses ain't working no more\nYou lil niggas ain't worth it no more\n\n[Outro]\nG Herbo, back on my old shit man\nYou know I'm still on some new shit\nYou know I'm bossed up, embracing all my power\nBut I'm back on my old shit man, I don't give a fuck\nBout none of that shit niggas talkin' bout\nWe still on gangsta shit, we still seeing niggas\nIn public, in the club, smacking the shit out niggas\nHittin' niggas with bottles, pistol-whipping niggas\nAll that gangsta shit, with all this ice on\nAll these VV's on, Rollies on, all that nigga\nWe got 30's on us, Glocks, FN's, all that shit, you know\nStill dropping 4 Minutes Of Hell on you fuck niggas\nThis part 5 right here, in case you didn't know\nYou know what I'm saying, free all my niggas\nR.I.P. my niggas man, I'm in the studio right now\nGot my big bro in here, Sizzle, with me, top in here\nYou know, brazy, Big B's, you know, G-Squeak\nIn this bitch, uh huh... for real, and we got more guns\nThan us... for real, for real, for real, for real, for real....\nThem bitches ain't never touching Instagram\nNothin, none of that, never seeing Instagram\nSnapchat, none of that silly ass shit you niggas\nDoing, cuz we out here for real (bitch)..."}]}
