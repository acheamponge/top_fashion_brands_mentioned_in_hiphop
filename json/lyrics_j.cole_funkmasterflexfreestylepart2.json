CL or Pete Rock\nShit or was it a perfect marriage\nMe I'm both in one my beats got me the chain\nMy raps bought me this Range, my diamond chain the clearest\nFunny how a youngin, I never liked carrots\nBut now I'm older and I'm eating better, which means\nLess beef and more cheddar, more bread, more lettuce\nWas always fucking dimes but nowadays more let us\nFrom a world where love was just four letters, a go getta\nMy shows better, my flows better\nA go getta rarely do i do better\nI'm too set in my ways I'm too gutter to change\nShould have known that I'm the coldest I'm two letters away\nNigga who better than Jay? From the the the Roc\nNot HOV though its Cole yo\nNiggas taking pictures every time I'm in the store yo\nWhen I hit the club they be snapping on the low yo\nNiggas snapping pictures every fucking where i go yo\nSometimes i be mad as shit\nThen I say stupid motherfucker boy you asked for this\nOh yeah I did, didn't I, did it big, didn't I\nMade my album sell like it did a bid, didn't I\nCheck the album credits that's produced and written by\nNone other then yours truly\nI'm bored sue me, I'm all on the Billboards I'm tryna make Forbes sue me\nAudio visual nigga, I could score a movie\nYou couldn't score a bucket, I'm aiming at Warren Buffett\nAnd painting my poorest fuck it, it rains and it pours\nI'm covered out on these tours, running a train on your whore\nTake her home in a Ford, ironic 'cause I explore\nNigga I explore!\n\n[Verse 2]\nProphecys fulfilled, as i proceed to kneel\nDodging greed of niggas who cock and squeeze to steal\nI do this for my niggas that got degrees and still broke as fuck\nFuck your flag, democracy has failed\nI'm in the realest state with no properties for sale\nProbably could build with Socrates himself\nNo soccer moms to throw us on soccer teams but still\nKick shit so cold boy, I can freeze in hell\nNow do tell exactly how does it feel\nTryna save a generation knowing that you never will\nTryna do rap without some nigga tryna pay your bills\nCause you black and rap you'll never do no numbers like Adele\nOh well Momma already been through hell\nI could turn this into heaven if my records even sell\nI'm a firm believer if you never quit you never fail\nIf I slip I grab the rail, I'll get a grip and never fail\n\n[Verse 3]\nFalling victim to this society, wheres hoes gaining notoriety\nAnd if I ain't rocking chains these kids won't admire me\nNiggas try extorting me to get a verse up out of me\nNigga eat dick your street shit don't apply to me\nI walk around dolo no security YOLO\nSo if a nigga plan to put a bullet through my polo\nCause i wouldn't help his promo so be it\nKill you niggas without licking a shot, this cold war, Soviet\nNo Vietnam, back in Fayettenam. no stay at home moms\nWe was far from street niggas but we played along\nWalk around with our mean mugs painted on\nRest in peace to all the teen thugs\nMay the lord bless your soul\nCross the crossings this must be called life\nMomma stressed she been stressing all night\nBut momma your little bundle of joy\nIs clever enough to avoid the pitfalls of this world they destroyed\nThis is clever nigga i never seen another nigga"}], "artist": "J.
