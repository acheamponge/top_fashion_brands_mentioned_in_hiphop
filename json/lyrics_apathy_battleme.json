Vol. 1", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI master my steez, disaterous to wacker MC's\nAttacking with ease, and bring a bat to shatter your knees\nI'm badder than these...\nRappers screaming, \"Apathy please, show mercy\"\nBut their begging doesn't matter to me\nI'm allergic to wacker rappers, and automaticaly sneeze\nSo when they rap after me, I try not to breathe\nBlow flows into tissue like boogies and snots\nCock the hammer, pop the Glock like a rookiesh cop\nAnd when bitches see me rock, their pussy gets hot\nGot 'em counting down the days that it took me to drop\nAnd when the records in the store, you'll be begging for more\nCause you never heard a style like this perfected before\nFrom the surface of the Earth to the center of the core\nEpidermis of a girl or placenta of a whore\nAll the verses in the World couldn't settle the score\nCause Apathetic is the master of the deepest metaphors\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'll snatch your link, just to make you think\nI draw gats quicker than the human optical blinks\nHave you terrified, washing your sweaty face in a sink\nCause you pussy like a porn star dressed in pink\nI'm on the brink of blowing to being thrown in the clink\nCause I start fights with cats like my shit don't stink\nYou think you gigantic, but you Titanic sink\nI'm dynamic with ink, making larger heads shrink\nI don't rock ice, don't even like ice in drinks\nGo south for the winter, too hot for ice rinks\nYou flow soft, knock your nose off like the Sphinx\nHit hoes off, that's why your girls see's me and winks\nI'm the sleeziest rap fink, Hip-Hop's Larry Flynnt\nHard to see like black tints, cats squint to glimpse\nNever leave hints, photos, or finger prints\nI'm down low, below underground macs and pimps\nYou new jack's and whimps, try hard, but cum limp\nWhile my name is getting print across billboards and blimps\nAp Bar-B-Ques you shrimps, leaving my imprints\nAn inch in your skull before you could even flinch\nBattle me, step up and die\nSo let me clarify, that I terrify\nParalyze, while you sit there and cry\nI never lie, verify\nI travel without moving like Ap was Jamiroquai", "year": null}]}
