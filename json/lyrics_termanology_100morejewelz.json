How much we really owe?\nThe video budgets the funniest of ugly tricks\nThey make you look rich, throw you back in the hood with shit\nThem Ramen noodles is bomb when you starving truthfully\nI'm with an army of thugs that will bug out and will shoot for me\nI write about my real life, y'all write fantasy raps\nYou ever see the fire fly out a cannon and splash?\nSomebody shit and they call the pigs and you gotta dash\nPray they don't find the guns that we hid in my mother's grass\nSomehow my enemies just never disappear it get's crystal clear\nWhen I look in the mirror and see why they would fear us\nYou know they fear what they don't understand\nFearless but a humble man\nGot my mind set on Europe and Japan\nThe type of money I made overseas from rapping\nIs more than you made from trapping\nSo really who the hustler man?\nI'm sitting laughing at you dudes that judging bugging\nTalking 'bout we underground so we don't see no real money\nBut what's funny is\nI been to more countries than you could spell for me\nAnd I ain't had no Birdman, Russell or Puffy helping me\nMy fans see me in the street, don't know what to expect from me\nIs he in a Ferrari or is he taking the bus with me\nLuckily I've been on the winning side of a lot of blessings\nAnd aside from the stressing, I gotta say it's impressive\nBut even though I'm on that TV that you stare into\nAin't shit changed, the guns or yay' still available"}], "artist": "Termanology"}
