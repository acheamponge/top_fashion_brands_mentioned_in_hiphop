I can't take no more\nWhat it was, it just ain't no more\nSee, I can never tell what's real and fake no more\nI don't know what to say no more\nI guess my definition of love ain't the same as yours\nLike I've been in this place before\nWay more times than I shoulda been\nTryna break out of the box that they put us in\nAnd I caught myself thinkin' like way back\nThinkin' 'bout me and you and what we coulda been\nFirst, you hate me then love me again\nYou start to miss me then we fuckin' again\nThen we back to fightin', you don't trust me and then\nYou forget about me and I'm nothin' again, like\n\n[Verse 2]\nI can't front, all the sex and the hair grey\nBut all the stress in my head, aye\nSee, I'm broken and you know it\nLately, I've been tryin' not to show it\nSo hit me on the late night, girl, when you need\nAnd I'll be around, yeah, you know I'm still down\nWe fight, we fuck, it's back and forth\nYou front like you leavin', but you always end up comin' back for more\nAnd that's real\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nEverybody knows you don't feel how I feel about you, girl\nEverybody knows you fucked me over and I'm still about you, girl\nEverybody knows I was nothing like your last\nI should put you in the past\nThey thought me and you would never last\n\n[Hook]\nBut we fight then we break up, aye\nThen we fuck 'til we make up, yeah\nThrough the nights that we wake up, aye\nIt ain't right, nah, it ain't love\nBut I need you, I need you\nWe fight then we break up, aye\nThen we fuck 'til we make up, yeah\nThrough the nights that we wake up, aye\nIt ain't right, nah, it ain't love\nBut I need you, I need you\nNeed you, you, you, you, you\nNeed you\nNeed you, you, you, you, you\n\n[Outro]\nAll these days I'm thinking of you\nYou're leaving me behind\nI'll put it all behind\nJust to be close to you\nAll these days I'm thinking of you\nYou're leaving me behind...", "year": "2017-08-18"}]}
