You must have a lookalike\"\nKid's just another guy following a call to action\nHe'd give up his life for the Bastion\nI\n\n[Hook]\nDrank a Black Tonic\nSampled the track and rapped on it\nI've been to the brink\nAnd the Bastion's coming back from it\nDrank a Black Tonic\nSampled the track and rapped on it\nI've been to the brink\nAnd the Bastion's coming back from it\n\n[Outro]\nWe're coming back...\nWe're coming back now\nYou don't need to play a new game, trust\nJust boot up New Game Plus\nYou don't need to play a new game, trust\nJust boot up New Game Plus\nWe're coming back now", "year": "2015-06-13"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
