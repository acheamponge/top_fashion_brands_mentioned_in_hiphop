It's always trouble in Gotham\nIf he stutter, they robbin', we catch the shuttle to Harlem\nMakin' plays like Hudls, it's no rebuttals, they solid\nThe code from the OGs, the Jordan, the Kobes\nI be studying game, get the score from the nosebleeds\nWhen you tourin', exploding, its more important than voting\nLittle niggas getting killed and now we forced to be toting\nCuz I done lost some lil' homies, couple cousins, it's crazy\nA lil' brother straight bustin', now he stuck with a baby\nAnd he like fuck it it's gravy, it's just another occasion\nWas some luck that gone save him, but shit he stuck on probation\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd it's just another day in the life\nWhen you raised in the trife\nNow I'm payin' the price for my bad decisions\nLay awake in the night\nGotta pray to get right\nIn the shade gettin' high like I had to get it\n\n[Verse 2]\nMade a couple transactions, felt fantastic\nThat retail therapy is just a scam tactic\nA new wave of new slaves to the brand package\nBoy my gas be supreme, not a damn jacket\nI ran rapid, sheep niggas with lamb habits\nCollege kids doin' xans, acid, and cram classes\nProcrastinate on exam passes and slam asses\nFast forward, my fans massive, my plans mastered\nSpeakin' from experience, I seen from these lames\nYour potential isn't tapped, where will it even begin\nMy whole team gon' be eatin', don't mind feedin' my friends\nCuz dog, I'd rather be in meetings, fuck tweetin' a trend\nOn the outside strong but I'm bleedin' within\nI know you tired of all the cryin' and the grievin' the sin\nGod gave LeBron height and blessed me with a pen\nA real nigga but most of all, a leader of men\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd it's just another day in the life\nWhen you raised in the trife\nNow I'm payin' the price for my bad decisions\nLay awake in the night\nGotta pray to get right\nIn the shade gettin' high like I had to get it", "title": "Fighting Temptations"}]}
