I don't identify with that shit, like, my identity is the music, everything you need to know about me is in the music: my home, it's where I originate, it's where I fall apart, it's where I come to life.\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nBack in the booth let the tragedy in\nSwitched up the team, let the magic begin\nTold all you haters, I'm in it to win it\nWay back when them losers wasn't letting me in\nAll of these bitches is mad at me, so?\nMoney appeared now they magically foe\nHonestly really can't pay it no mind\nBecause spending that time means I'd rather be broke\nI'm out here living my passions and more\nWitnessing peace as it pass through my soul\nNothing can irritate masses like literally showing them stagnance can turn into growth\nHaters gon hate when you winning this shit\nDone for these bitches, they tend to forget\nI'm out here yelling 'bitch, look at me now!'\nI was once underground, now I'm stuck in the clouds\n14 whole hours, a trip out to Spain\nHigh in the clouds, bitch I'm gulping the rain\nJust a year later still fucking these haters\nWhile facing my fears, no more running from pain\nHead is on straight so I'm gunning with aim\nNo more fucking with bitches who stunting for fame\nYou can catch me out roofless in something deranged\nAin't it funny how suddenly something can change?\n\n[Hook]\nYou gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life\nAnd turn it around\nTurn it around, turn it around\nEven when you feel you dumbing it down\nYou gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life\nAnd turn it around\nTurn it around, turn it around\nEven when you feel you dumbing it down\n\n[Verse 2]\nBack when the preacher said change is to come\nAll nonbelievers prepare to be sonned\nNot talking Jesus but honest to God\nI bet I reach my prime before air leaves my lungs\nSwitched it up bitches, adjusted my flow\nGo against me and get wrecked from the go\nAll of you bitches keep taking your shots\nBut if one come at me, then it's straight for your throat\nHarder than nipples on bitches aroused\nDeity swag and omnipotent style\nDon't fuck with my bread and don't fuck with my head\nCause if it get to that point then I'm seriously vile\nPromise you people that evil's alive\nWish you could see what I see with my eyes\nAll of the demons that be in mind\nSo I burned all my bridges and cut all my ties\nSaid I would do this back when I was 9\nSaid I would do this before I got signed\nSaid I would give all these lost kids and doubters\nA reason and purpose to question their lives\nLook where I am and then look where I've been\nTell me that I ain't destined to win\nNever give power to none of you cowards\nTo tell me what you think my destiny is\n\n[Hook]\nYou gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life\nAnd turn it around\nTurn it around, turn it around\nEven when you feel you dumbing it down\nYou gotta make a decision to be the one difference in your life\nAnd turn it around\nTurn it around, turn it around\nEven when you feel you dumbing it down\n\n[Verse 3]\nGone for a minute but back on my grind\nPromise you you are no match for my mind\nTook all my doubt, whipped it into submission\nAnd forced my ambition to step into line\nI know that they do not want me to shine\nI know that they do not want me to climb\nI know inside that being a boss means making these bitches get back on their jobs\nCan anyone fuck with me now? No\nHow do these bitches respond? Don't\nLooking behind to seeing me now\nWhat do they think I'm beyond? Dope\nI've just be taking my time, slow\nBeing alone in my mind, flow\nPutting the contents of all that's inside me into this shit I'm designed for\nCrossover, pivot, I'm back in the game\nNASCAR on bitches, I'm tracking my lane\nFocused on bridging the gap\nAnd showing the youth all the ways to accomplish their dreams\nKnow how it feels when they kicking you down\nAnd it's getting you down\nYou gotta make the decision to be the one difference in your life and turn it around\nTurn it around, turn it around\nEven when you feel you dumbing it down\nI know it's hard to be adamant, too\nWhen you stand out like a sore thumb in the crowd\nNo niggas and bitches and quitters allowed\nBall inside you until the survival of your dreams\nUntil you are living them out\n\n[Outro]\nEverything that you need to know about me is in the music\nMy home is the music, it's where I originate\nIt's where I fall apart, it's where I come to life", "year": "2014-01-27"}]}
