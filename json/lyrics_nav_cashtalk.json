These shooters gonna serve\nBrown boy from the dirt, don't get on my nerves\nFast cars like NASCAR, trap star to black cars, straps on\nDon't act hard, 'bouta hit the road\nI can't pick which car I'm gonna drive\nI been up so many nights, I just hope that I survive\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nUsed to wear my shoes and look out for the dirt\nNow I beat my Jordans, don't care what they worth\nDon't think about it, pay my bills right on the 1st\nI never thought I'd spend a thousand on a shirt\n\n[Chorus]\nThis that cash talk, this that cash talk\nYCFU, you cannot finagle us\nMe and Metro back-to-back in Rover trucks\nI want attention so I got the orange one\nThis that cash talk, this that cash talk\nPull up, I bet you get outlined in chalk\nI just spent like forty on my watch\nI'm lookin' down, I'm sittin' at the top\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis that cash talk, this that cash talk\nIf you ain't talkin' money, I don't wanna talk\nTwo-thousand on my feet, I do the money walk\nYou diss me, somethin' comin' for your head-top\nI can't trust that girl, so I won't do no long-talk\nI just want the head, I don't wanna make the bed rock\nI fucked that bitch and I still kept my pants on\nThese rappers act like bitches, need some tampons\nWrite my shit and make my beats, everything hands-on\nI'm the wrong one to put your hands on\nI spent eight-hunnid to keep my pants on\nCameras watchin' me, I'm the wrong one to dance on\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nUsed to wear my shoes and look out for the dirt\nNow I beat my Jordans, don't care what they worth\nDon't think about it, pay my bills right on the 1st\nI never thought I'd spend a thousand on a shirt\n\n[Chorus]\nThis that cash talk, this that cash talk\nYCFU, you cannot finagle us\nMe and Metro back-to-back in Rover trucks\nI want attention so I got the orange one\nThis that cash talk, this that cash talk\nPull up, I bet you get outlined in chalk\nI just spent like forty on my watch\nI'm lookin' down, I'm sittin' at the top"}], "artist": "NAV"}
