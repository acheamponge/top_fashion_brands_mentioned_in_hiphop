(Yea, I can do that)\nCan you do this? (Yea, I can do that)\nCan you do this? (Yea, I can do that)\nCan you do this? (Yea, I can do that)\nI know you think that you can move\nBut can you groove the way I groove?\n\n[Verse 2]\nGrab your slingshot, find a stone\nShoot the moon until the night is gone\nNow I should hope that moon got rhythm\nCause he gon\u2019 rock when my stone hit him\nLike boom, boom, boom, let me shine\nHe should know that the day is mine\n\n[Bridge] + [Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow why you standing on the wall\nDid you come to dance at all?\nI\u2019m watching you girl, watching me\nYou got moves, then let me see\n\n[Bridge 2]\nCan you do this? (Can you do this lady?)\nCan you do this? (Can you move like I do?)\nCan you do this? (Can you shake, shake it mama?)\nCan you do this? (Can you break it on down?)\n\n[Chorus]", "title": "Can You Do This", "album": "Lift Your Spirit"}], "artist": "Aloe Blacc"}
