Reign]\nDeep breath while I'm thinking about my ex, I've been stressed\nDon't deserve you but deserve to clear my chest, let me vent\nTook me losing you from me to find myself, no regrets\nHit your line you hit decline\nI get the message, you're upset\nAnd you friends can't even pay for pay-per-view, not a set\nBut would pay to see us fight man the life the main event\nThey ain't stars nah, they ain't painting, they ain't kempt\n'Needa cut them from your team, don't deserve to play the bench\nMan my life was mess, you told me you love me\nBut when you're young and got money it's hard to stick to one woman\nThis ain't excuses, apologize more than a million times\nThis is just my explanation for all the night that you sit and cry\nI know you do, don't say you don't\nI need you back, don't say you gone\nCalled me a king so I when and got that tat on my neck\nStill check my phone every hour praying your call or your text\n\n[Hook:]\nYou say you're gone, no never looking back\nYou say you're gone, no never looking back\nI say I'm on now, oh look at that\nIt's been too long now, I want you back\nI want you, I want you\nI want you back, I need you back\nI want you, I want you\nI want you back, I need you back\n\n[Verse 2: P. Reign]\nStill get them butterflies, not lie\nQuiet, she wanna know why\nCause every time I see you my stomach knots like a bow tie\nFour cheese rigatoni, she ordered and felt she owed me\nI told her things changed, I'm ballin' I feel like Kobe\nYou got a husband nine years now, still looking lonely\nOr just my mind playing tricks on me, praying you want me\nYou moved to Hollywood but finally came home for the holidays\nWe talked about the past and made me promise you I would never change\nBy being modest, humble, being honest\nCause you know I'm from a hood where they ain't raise no prima donnas\nWe're skipping classes just to sneak a kiss by the lockers\nThe only girl on my high school that wasn't caught up in gossip\nI never gave up on you, but I'd be lying if I told you I was waiting on you\nStill wishing we was back in the class\nBut let the past be the past\nAnd pray the memories last\n\n[Hook:]\nYou say you're gone, no never looking back\nYou say you're gone, no never looking back\nI say I'm on now, oh look at that\nIt's been too long now, I want you back\nI want you, I want you\nI want you back, I need you back\nI want you, I want you\nI want you back, I need you back", "year": null}]}
