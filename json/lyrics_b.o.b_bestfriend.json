She was so ready. She came, to the club, with an overnight bag, with a separate set of clothes in it. Took her shoes off. This bitch was back in the car with me and fuckin' B.o.B, tryna talk to B.o.B's friend, with her overnight bag. Had done fuckin' changed shoes. And I was like, 'wait a minute B.o.B, isn't that the same bitch from earlier tonight? But she in a whole different outfit?' And this bitch had a plastic bag READY. Ready for her fucking vacation. Just fuckin' crazy. YES! A 24-hour vacation. She was fuckin' ready. For the 24-hour trip of a motherfuckin' lifetime. And she knew what she was comin' for before the club opened. She packed! She probably had some wet wipes in there, like everything. THAT GIRL was crazy though, you know she was crazy. AND THEN was like, 'but I got a boyfriend' - BITCH, you don't have a boyfriend! Fuck outta here. That was the crazy shit.
