Another hit\nCan't do it like this. Can't do it like me nigga?\nNobody can do it like me\nDo it like this kid\nNature\nMy nigga yo\nSecond go round\nYou know me yo\nThe worlds greatest ..\n\n\n[Nature]\nI face hurtle after hurtle, leap after leap\nSeen murder after murder, week after week\nSame product i was pumpin some half a dirt cheap\nTryna cut my dough, some niggas is thirsty\nI try to front it off like it wouldn't hurt me\nFiends walking away, like my name was Herpes\nI never had a job so they never worked me\nBesides how much money do a fucking clerk see Nigga\nI got a brother tryna walk in my steps Nigga\nHeard ya'll cowards talking under ya'll breath\nWanna talk about my album some say that it flop\nI heard niggas crack jokes on the day that it drop\nThey hit ya, whole album nigga no samples nigga\nNo features, credits, no leeches\nI never gave a fuck about who it reaches\nOnce I put it out they heat it up, my niggas need this\nAnd those'll be the ones that'll carry the weight\nThey let me know when I'm carried away\nFuck the label Fuck sony's whole staff just for having me wait\nThree years in advance, scaring my fans\nI thought rap was supposed to be fun\nSecond go round, it goes down, this how it's posed to be done\nInterfere in your face, i'll be pokin a gun\nNever smile, you're my dawg if it close you my dun\nI run game to a chicken just to make her cluck\nIn the projects i'm best known for taking a buck\nIf a nigga's too sleepy I'll be waking him up\nIf a bitch is too sleepy I'll be making her fuck\nShe could cook a little, clean a little check in the mail\nHad her gased up she told me every record was real\nAnd I never would've thought that she was your wife\nYou was my best friend, we was all right"}], "artist": "Nature"}
