(Uh)\nI told my momma \"Can't believe I'm gettin' older, wish that I could stop it\" (Huh)\nShe like \"What's ya other option?\nYou either in the grave or you get another year\nSo blow these candles out, we just happy that you here\"\nI found a picture of me back in college\nMy skin was a little tighter, body was more brolic\nMy baby face got a new wrinkle up on it by my eyelid\nTold myself it must of been from all of this smiling\nLife, no one survives it\nAs much as we want to control it, it just throw suprises\nWhen I was young all I heard was you got potential\nBut I don't hear that no more, I hear the rent due\nAnd every birthday is bittersweet, it mean our time is shorter\nBefore I see the Lord I want to get some things in order\n29, this the victory lap\nMy fellows gather around, we just open my gold plaque\nThought I would feel more excited but really I'm kinda sad\nCan I do it again or all my greatest days in my past?\n\n[Chorus 2]\nTime, you just keep going\nAnd one day you are going on without me\nTime, come back, aye\n\n[Verse 2]\nI don't wanna do this when I'm 48\nWell I could but I ain't cool as Jay\nAnd I ain't cool as Ye\nI'm kinda cool with grey\nSo when the salt and pepper look come\nI'm ready for that day\nI don't wanna stretch before I play ball or go bald\nLose strength today worrying about tomorrow\nI had this moment, I was walking through the park\nSaw a boy playing catch, a woman walking her dog\nI thought, in a hundred years none of us will be here\nReplaced by new people that probably never cared you existed\nJust living they life, minding they business\nNo matter how famous you get, they still forget ya\n\n[Break]\nRemember the time, the Beatles said that they more famous than Jesus?\nI still think it's funny\nSome people didn't know who Paul McCartney was until he made a song with Yeezus\nBut, millions still gathered on Sunday\nPreach\n\n[Verse 3]\nLife is less of a line, more like a circle\nWe can't wait to grow up, and pray for the reversal\nOr pay for the reversal\nAlong the way I learn to enjoy it while you have it\nAnd forgive whoever hurt you 'cause\nIn the end if you don't get healed, you get revenge\nAnd even if it feels sweet you never really win\nIt's hard to sleep, lay in bed and have peace when\nYou became the very thing you hated just to get even\nSo tell me what you believe in\nIt's nothing that you say it's what your doing everyday\n29 years of life look what I became (Momma)\n'Cause I'm a little less eager to prove something\nMore confident in who I am\nIt doesn't make for good TV but make me a better man\n\n[Chorus 1]\nTime, you just keep going\nAnd one day you are going on without me\nTime, you just keep going\nAnd one day you are going on without me\nTime, you just keep going\nAnd one day you are going on without me\nTime, time, time, come back\n\n[Outro]\nHappy birthday dear Andy\nHappy birthday to you\nHey, alright, ok alright\nThere we go, alright (Make it a good one!)\nYeah, I had to think about it\nI'm in here"}]}
