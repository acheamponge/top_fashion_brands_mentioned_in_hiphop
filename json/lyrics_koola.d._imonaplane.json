Who cares?\nFear not of man because man must die and that's fine I ain't too scared\nI'd be lying if I said I\u2019ve never resorted to crime for a new pair\nBut what I know about life? It ain't too fair\nSo I see why the youth wanna get the little ice and the new gear\nBut fuck it, I be nice off a few beers\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nKool A.D., the navel gazer\nThe wavy bather, the lazy shaver\nThe gravy taster, the crazy caker, the paper taker\nThe lady chaser, the Jake Braker, the grape laser\nThe lane changer, the game changer, the chain claimer\nThe brain breaker, the strange stranger, the \"brang-dang-er\"\nThe anger, the danger\nMajor, like I sprang from a dame in the manger, framed by the angels\nBut the frame ain't the same man, it change with the angles\nGang bangers engaged that make bagels and pastels that make the pages\nEnraging the blank statesmen that play with the bank statement\nLike it\u2019s just another day at the races, let's face it\nIt\u2019s all basically apeshit crazy, sincerely Kool A.D., baby\nPay me, gravy train, wavy\n\n[Hook]"}]}
