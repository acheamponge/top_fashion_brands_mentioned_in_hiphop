{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Aesop Rock and Dose One]\nThis is not your ordinary ballad\nWith a perfect little bow around the middle\nAnd a black knight on a white horse\nOr a white knight on a black horse\nIt's got all these tired parts where\nWe don't even sing and random\nPrincess raise the drawbridge\nWe don't serve your kind\nIt ends where it begins\nAnd the beginning isn't pretty\nCan't forget that not-so-perfect\nBow around the middle ('round the middle, 'round the middle...)\n\nAnd it goes a little something like this..\n\n[Aesop Rock]\nMoon walking a broken soul pedigree incessant\nGut the cruddy frame\nThe zealots enveloped inside the belly of the blame\nCutthroats the result of pulp jokes soaked in poacher constants\nAnd not a jewel amidst coal wander prominent.. honor (honor)\nI bought up silkworms by the bucket like starter kits\nSew your first martyr stitch\nJoin damaged mammoth brigading caper\nNurse the tantrum with a fantasy chaser\nI keep the spare wings strapped to my fuses\nIn case the hackers snatch the plumage\n\n[Dose One]\nSo you mean these things are worth money\nNow drifting off\nThis is the who-you-calling-homeless\nMock me fearful\nTwisted mighty fearful twisted and tonight I got front row seats at the d-d-d-d-dead concert\nAnd you're in it, Ichabod\n\nRunning out of morals for my allegory...
