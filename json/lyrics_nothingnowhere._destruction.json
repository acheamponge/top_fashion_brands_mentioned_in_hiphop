(Yeah)\nGo and shut the door in my face and you runnin' right back\nAnd I've been going off with your heart every day, no cap (Ay, ay)\nBut the pain gonna come either way and we both know that\nSo impatient, I've been feeling vacant\nWhat am I chasing? Stuck inside this basement (Whoa)\nFeeling useless, wonder what the use is\nAnd the truth is, I don't wanna do this\n\n[Chorus]\nDestruction, destruction, I'm trying to forget\nIt's been years, I can picture your silhouette\nDisruption, corruption, inside my head\nSo how am I supposed to feel now?\nTreading water when you're not around\nAnd one more night I think that I'mma drown\nSo how am I supposed to feel?\nAnd how am I supposed to feel now?\n(And how am I supposed to feel?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou only call when you need me\nOnly try when it's easy\nI remember back in VT\nOld Vans with the 'preme tee\nI just feel like it was better then\nNow it's different and it's evident\nNow it's harder than it's ever been\nBuilt a house to burn it down again\n\n[Chorus]\nDestruction, destruction, I'm trying to forget\nIt's been years but I still see your silhouette\nDisruption, corruption, it's all in my head\nSo tell me how I'm supposed to feel now\nTreading water when you're not around\nOne more night I think that I'mma drown\nSo tell me how I'm supposed to feel\n(Tell me, tell me how I'm supposed to feel)\nSo tell me how I'm supposed to feel now\nTreading water when you're not around\nOne more night I think that I'mma drown\n(Disruption, corruption, it's all in my head)\nSo tell me how I'm supposed to feel now\n\n[Outro]\n(Destruction, destruction, I'm trying to forget)\n(It's been years, I can picture your silhouette)\n(Disruption, corruption, inside my head)\nSo how am I supposed to feel?"}], "artist": "\u200bnothing,nowhere."}
