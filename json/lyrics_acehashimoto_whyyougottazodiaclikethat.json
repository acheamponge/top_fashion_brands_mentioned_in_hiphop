More love than a Care Bear Stare\nThey're just weird if they don't understand this love\nSo in love like hands in gloves\n(That's pretty often, pretty awesome)\n\n[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]\nWe going harder and harder, higher and higher\nEvery dream is assembly required\nBeen watching and waiting for my constellation\nShow me a sign, a sign in the sky\nWe going harder and harder, higher and higher\nEvery dream is assembly required\nBeen watching and waiting for my constellation\nShow me a sign, a sign in the sky\n\n[Outro: brandUn DeShay]\nHarder, harder, higher, hi-hi\nHarder, harder, higher, hi-hi\nHarder, harder, higher, hi-hi\nHarder, harder, higher, hi-hi\nHarder, harder, higher, hi-hi\nHarder, harder, harder, hi-hi\nHarder, harder, higher, hi-hi\nHarder, harder...", "year": "2009-09-16", "album": "Volume: Three!
