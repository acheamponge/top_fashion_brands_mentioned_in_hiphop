Trinity - \u201cOfficially Lost\u201d\n[Emcee(s): Vordul Mega, 4th Pyramid, and C-Rayz Walz]\n[Producer(s): 4th Pyramid]\n\n[Verse 1: Vordul Mega]\nIn cities with lights and cameras and action\nWe was throwing them Dukes into Hazzards\nKeep my head around ninjas and samu-\n-rais, where demons and angels dwell, and the\nScent of death inhaled.  Paranoias\nOf chaos and the madness of mysti-\n-cisms and mayhem.  Studying the\nPowers of subconscious, ground in the great\nEastern ends with my peoples that spray hems\nTrying to get through on snorkels to lace Timbs\nWhen the Hulk is loose, find a force\nRunning in a bubblegoose, trying to trouble you\nWith statements of racist.  You\u2019re trying to stay in\nTouch without families and close ones\nThat is real suffering in the hells of\nState prisons.  I stay up, see you in the physical\n\n[Verse 2: 4th Pyramid]\nMy turn.  I grab the bars and do fifty\nRap with stars like, \u201cWho is he?\u201d\nCan\u2019t \u201cSpitamat\u201d if your flow too flimsy\nTrinity get dap for rap in new cities\nI\u2019ll do mine with one hand and new kicks be\nIn the sand with a style that flew with me\nCalisthenics, I\u2019m vegetarian, \u2018cause the\nCows demand that I\u2019m about my bidness\nGet on the ground, give me twenty\nPush up these standards, don\u2019t deal with envy\nSit up straight.  You don\u2019t need them Bentleys\nBut I should take one alongside with some Henny\nDrink and drive, I don\u2019t do that, leave\nThat for the dicks that die.  It\u2019s just I\u2019m\nThe type to get up and go, yo\nI\u2019ll spit scripts with my pen and just flow\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nZen by\nLinum, Shaolin succumb to Buddha.  No\nChips.  Just fucked-up computers.  \u201cSpita-\n-mat,\u201d hollow the tip\u2014blao!  Pitter pat\nThe beat\u2014(No!)\u2014or at least follow the kid\nYou know what it is, what it was, who took it\nKid, and where they put it is so translucent\nSigns of time, they\u2019re pissing me off.  Find\nYours \u2018cause mine\u2019s...\n\n[Verse 4: Vordul Mega, 4th Pyramid, and C-Rayz Walz]\n[Vordul Mega]\nOfficially lost and The Man is trying to hold\nOnto everything that I\u2019m glad for like, yo\nEverything I know that\u2019s true.  We always\nGoing through madness.  We do what we got to\n[4th Pyramid]\nC'est la vie.  A toxic Salem\u2019s\nTrees hating green, the place that you paid the\nBeat\n[C-Rayz Walz]\nAliens landing, graze the streets\n[4th Pyramid]\nOnly one thing happened when they played that beat..."}]}
