I guess no one\nBut I will have fun and I get the job done\nOn the airplane, movin' like the Concord\nCome and join me, everybody on board\nYou won't be bored with the stuff I'm pickin' up\nWatch me quicken up and with the pace, I pick it up\nPick up the pace\n\n[Chorus]\nSecond verse and never cursin'\nRockin' the microphone with the style that I'm reherasin'\nIn person, that means liver\nSwimmin' and slimmin' just like a deep sea diver\nI'll arrive, uh, just to go faster\nGrab the microphone and show that I am the master\nOf disaster, cookin' up a potion\nWith the funky rhymes to put the people into motion\nOf the ocean, movin' like the water\nHere's the menu, go place your order\nIt's a slaughter, a felony of chatter\nAnd pickin' up the pace is the subject matter\n\n[Chorus]\nBreak it down\n\nOh yes, I pick up the pace\nTake a look at the crowd and take a look at my face\nListen to my rhyme and listen to them yell\nIt's like a man in jail gettin' out of the cell\nI don't why they go by\nWeak names and swear that they're so fly\nThey gotta try it again to rock the mic my friend\nGo from A to Z and from beginning to end\nNow I could go slower, like the other guys do\nBut I ain't with it, that's what I'm tellin' you\nI think it's kind of stupid, I think it's a disgrace\nInstead of going slow they should be pickin' up the pace\nLike this\nRock and roller\nCoca Cola\nHot like soda\nRollin' like a boulder\nDancin', prancin', mic enhancin'\nJust give me a chance, and girls, I'm romancin'\nUnderstand it, underhanded\nLeavin' you stranded, runnin' like a bandit\nYo, young money, in my hands you're putty\nI'm pickin' up the pace and rockin' the mic\nYeah, buddy\n\n[Chorus]\nPick up the pace", "album": "Stone Cold Rhymin\u2019", "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/7e9ff08751b8e32d468ac9e4127b8bec.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young MC"}
