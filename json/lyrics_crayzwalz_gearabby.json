You know why I'm fresh, yo\nOf course you do, but here's my letter\nYou'll get jumped by fifteen spirits\u2014I'm Triple 5 Soul\nIt all started when my man L said, \"Yo!\nI like your energy.  I know you got an ill flow\nJust call me up next time you got a show.\"\nShout out to T, Nick, Mac, Red, O\nCamilla, Chris, and the rest of the staff I know\nI design like Kevin Long, create flavor\nI'm a Goonie on a mission, a truth sayer\nI stack arms.  My bullshit stay on the Phat Farm\nMy snorkel collar up like the hip hop Fonz\nI'm a Lion King living in a Scar city\nBut I'll still score cause I play for varsity\nI swear my head's nappy like my gear truly\nWack emcees wanna sue me, take Walz to Judge Judy\nStronghold\u2014you know how we do: no delay\nI stand out in the crowd like [styles of an EJ?]\nMass Appeal in my briefcase, rocking each state\nI take out music then hike to Crystal Lake\nI'm like Chaka Zulu drinking a big brew\nPlease no beat biting and that means your crew\nSo when I look good, you look good too\nAnd the way I rock the crowd, I make 'em wanna rock you\nI must show respect where respect is due\nGear Abby and that means you\n\n[Outro]\nGear Abby, thank you (x3)\n\"Yo Walz, that shit looks hot!\"\nThank you"}]}
