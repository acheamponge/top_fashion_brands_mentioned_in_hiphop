We's rock steady vultures\nPlus I's the guise of rowin a soul\nMy wingspan stands flags in the snow of the poles\nBezerk\nSwerve my alignment towards solitary confinement and jade it\nStripping, color my passion mitigated\nSlipping\n\n(Ann Colville)\nYou always seem like a small grey cat to me\nSleepin underneath the silvery moon\nPaws curled beneath your head\n'til the sun came round just around noon\nAnd you would greet me, purring in your doorway\nDrawing up your tail around my hips\nAnd I would go to your mouth wide open\nWaitin for my nourish to come from your lips\nAnd I move you\nAnd you like it\nJust enough\nTo let me\nBut I hate you\nCause you're lonely\nAnd you know how\nTo forget me\n\n(Aesop)\nFor the love of my personal practice I reside\nWhere obstructive fluxes and societal withdrawl collides\nSlide fuel by the fury\nSpun a ring around my honor\nBut the opulence took shelter in my horror\nMelancholy masquerade\nCast amongst the braiding of biligerence\nAnd blazing terror that blew the lock down off my placement\nI stay special agent till the sky falls\nReverse the curse till my fellow lost children disperse\n\n(Ann Colville)\nAnd your footsteps leading down the pathway\nNever seem to be quite like my own\nYour mind is smokey circles\nIt blinded me till I turned towards home\nAnd you would watch me far in the distance\nHands held high above your head\nI only leave the territory where there's nothing left, to be said\nAnd I move you\nAnd you like it\nJust enough\nTo let me\nBut I hate you\nCause you're lonely\nAnd you know how\nTo forget me\n\n(Sample from System 605)\n\"You can come, and meet my Mother\"\n\n(Aesop)\nI make music and connect color to canvas\nSwoop down from the trees with potpourris and other bandits\nLanded randomly upon the valleys of the grimace\nSaw my planted leaf stars burnin from the oustide in\nMeaning your clout lies thin\nSalt prep the blades prior to five phase in my ever changin underworld\nSerate a day to decorate a traitor\nThat sting never fades like belly wounds from sling blades\nFollow my portion, Im gonna swallow distortion and spit the filter\n\n(Sample from System 605)\n\"You can come, I'll leap right over\nAny day you like\nSystem 605, Union 91\"", "title": "Shere Kahn", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/64fbb9620a6b5e79e87c654b74da5441.640x640x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
