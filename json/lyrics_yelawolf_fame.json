And am I lookin' at that watch?\nIt could be the end of it all, maybe my last shot\nBut I got a funny feeling it ain\u2019t right\nI tell my manager, but he just thinkin it\u2019s stage-fright\nMinus the fuckin sweat that\u2019s drippin off of my face\nI realize if I do it, then it\u2019s only for a price\nSo am I lookin' at a hook wit the bait, bite?\nAm I the big catch? A dinner for late night?\nDo they realize I\u2019m in terrible shape, right?\nCan\u2019t even afford to get my little boy a bike\nI sit down in front of LA Reid\nThe president of Def Jam, the boss before me\nAnd to my left is KP and 30 of A&R's who work for him\nHe said Yelawolf is an emcee from Alabama\nYelawolf you can have the floor and\nI told him if you wanna see me sing\nCome catch me tourin' but I ain\u2019t performin' for the fame\n\n[Interlude]\nAnd just like that (Fame fame fame)\nI lost a deal with Def Jam (Fame fame fame)\nAnd I went home on Christmas broke\nI didn\u2019t know what the fuck to do man (Fame fame fame)\nShit (Fame fame fame)\n\n[Hook 1]\nMoney comes and goes just like the fallin' rain\nBetter leave a bucket outside and collect the change\nSomeday we\u2019ll look back and think what have we gained?\nAnd I hope we can say\nMore than fame\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhat\u2019s the use in complaining about the decision I made?\nIf it\u2019s rainin' (Then it's rainin')\nThen fuck it, pull the umbrella out, hey that\u2019s entertainment (Entertainment)\nI\u2019m above it and focused\nGot a lot of shows I gotta go hit\nIn the back of my mind I\u2019m thinkin, \"Did I blow it?\" (Did ya blow it?)\nDid you notice all the people you roll with\nAre losing their focus because of my ego (My people)\n\u2018Cause I\u2019m hopeless, won\u2019t listen to nobody\nThey sit and go on about how I won\u2019t make it (You won't make it)\nIf I keep fuckin' up relationships with executive folks\nWith these checks to cut for deals, I\u2019ll be broke then\nStuck in the south with nothing but my old shit\nAin't no new whips, new house, new clothes\nNew dough, you know you gotta go face it\nLook who in the eyes, say I\u2019m sorry for fucking up\nThese rappers are coming up\nWhat you gonna do about it?\nJust sit back and watch 'em and get up\nAnd make a move about it, be about it\nSee it\u2019s about the way you committed, now you got to go-and-get it\nI got a question\nAre you strong enough? Answer:\n\"Fuck yeah!\"\nI ain\u2019t about to be another white-boy stuck here\nHit the road, do any fuckin' show that I could get overseas, let's go!\nCanada, let\u2019s go\nSouth by South-West\nYelawolf Expo, killed that\nMade it my\nFocus, let\u2019s roll\nNow every label and their mamma tryin' to get a hold\nNone of 'em had me, and here come Interscope\n\n[Interlude]\nYea\nThen I got a deal\nYou know?\nI don\u2019t know\nI guess integrity goes a long way man\nGotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em\nShady Records\nSlumerican\n\n[Hook 2]\nJust give me some place that I can hang\nSomewhere way back in the back to drink a drink\nYou ain\u2019t gotta tell me that I ain\u2019t the same, I'm sayin'\nI\u2019ve seen some things\nPeople change\n\n[Hook 1]\nMoney comes and goes just like the fallin' rain\nBetter leave a bucket outside and collect the change\nSomeday we\u2019ll look back and think what have we gained?\nAnd I hope we can say\nMore than fame", "title": "Fame"}]}
