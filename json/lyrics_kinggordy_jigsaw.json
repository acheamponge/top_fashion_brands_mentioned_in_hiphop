How did I end up in this?\nI was in the crib eatin lunch and shit, my girl was about to suck my dick\nThen I feel a pinch of the needle with some drugs in it\nBlacked out, woke up with five another people cuffed and shit\nIn a TV box is a doll, tells us what to get and do to get out this problem\nNow we're working up and sweatin\nTwo people just died in front of me, please\nI hope this is a joke, just somebody fuckin with me\n\n[Hook]\nI'mma make em scream torture, bloody murder\nI came to eat your brains\nI got a couple tools for ya, to hurt ya\nI came to bring the pain\nI'mma make em scream torture, bloody murder\nI came to eat your brains, oh\nI'm the realest motherfucker when I spit raw\nGot something up, but he's called Jigsaw\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe door is closed, you're in rooms, open stories, open wounds\nOn the floor, you are doomed, what's in store, I assume\nSomething more out of loop, tryin to plan an escape\nAll those leads are misleading, I'm trapped in this place\nCan't breathe, my knees bleedin, a slap in the face\nWhen I need to keep thinkin, get back in the race\nTo achieve the freedom\nEven if it means takin a member of my team and eat him\nHis meat will be in fajitas to feed us\nYou're looking at a desperate man with a severed hand\nWatched every damn body died, please tell me\nWhen this shit is over, 20 seconds left, now I'm getting sober\nRealize I wanna live, now I'm listening to his orders\nGotta fuck myself up, just to get out of this shit\nI cut my whole dick off, just to get out of this quick\nWhat am I saying, see there's no one here to save me\nI've put myself in this game, I'm the only one playin'\n\n[Hook]"}]}
