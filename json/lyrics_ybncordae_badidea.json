I'm tearin' up as I'm startin' to stare in y'all eyes\nI know the shit you goin' through the last month\nYou stressin' as you hittin' on that glass blunt\nA nigga prayin' to get lucky like Daft Punk\nYou can't even stomach the pain, now that's a bad lunch\nUh, ramen noodles on the regular\nAdd some seasoning and some hot sauce for a better touch\nPeanut butter, jelly and syrup sandwich, etcetera\nAnd we just flyin' in the nebula\n\n[Chorus: YBN Cordae]\nAnd it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSee, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSo don't you cry, little baby, little baby\n(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)\nIt'll be alright\nSo don't you cry, little baby, little baby\n(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)\nIt's gon', it'll be alright\n\n[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]\nI done been around the world four times, lookin' for parkin'\nFinally found a condo, that shit still feel like apartment\nOut South, my foul mouth started soundin' like Cartman\nRoundabout like cartwheels, hopped inside of a U-Haul\nConfused where all my art went, monsters in a quiet place\nSome of these decisions is like Sharpie on a dry-erase\nI know they thought I wouldn't, but I'm a fireplace\nI had my cake and ate it too, that shit is an acquired taste\nI promised I would buy a place, I got my favorite roommates\nThey used to never see me, like when you zip up a new Bape\nDo that shit 'fore it's too late, don't ever drink the Kool-Aid\nDon't ever think it's sweet, that's that cr\u00e8me de la br\u00fbl\u00e9e\nWho they? They Robert Goulet, they Nazi, cuckoo, goofy\nMy wifey yellin', \"Who they?\" My daughter yellin', \"Hooray\"\nI see it clear like Blu-Ray, I park it in the sky\nI keep 'em on my block, 'round the corner of my eye\nLike a stye (Uh)\n\n[Verse 3: YBN Cordae]\nSo don't you shed a tear\n'Cause there'll be better years\nI live life by faith, nigga, instead of fear\nGod cryin', thunderstorms is Heaven tears\nThe feelin' of lost hope, shit is never here\n'Cause we gon' make it happen by any means\nA young nigga, dawg, but I done witnessed many things\nAge 13, wearin' hand-me-down skinny jeans\nYou know they a little extra faded around the knees\nWith the grass stains in 'em\nI really wish a little extra cash came in 'em, 'cause a nigga really needed it\nPain, I defeated it, and brought back\nSoul survivor, nigga, what you call that?\n\n[Chorus: YBN Cordae]\nAnd it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSee, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSo don't you cry, little baby, little baby\n(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)\nIt'll be alright\nSo don't you cry, little baby\n(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)\nIt's gon', it's gon' be alright\nAnd it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSee, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again\nSo don't you cry, little baby\nIt'll be alright\nSo don't you cry, little baby\nIt'll be alright", "title": "Bad Idea"}]}
