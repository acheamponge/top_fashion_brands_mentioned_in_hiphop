All I want is her heart\nAnd of Course that secret hidden treasure when her legs come apart\nAnd if I was to ever fall off my game she wouldn't leave me\nShe'd help me get back on my feet and back on my CHANGE\n\n[Chorus]\nBaby girl\nI'm used to the wrong woman\nNow I got my own woman\nShe so good to me she gotta be my\nBaby girl\n\nNo Longer do I have to search\nShe a diamond she down to Earth\nIts Understood to me she gotta be mine\nBaby Girl\n\nAnd Everytime we sexing\nThat hidden room is like a weapon\nHey she gotta be mine\nBaby Girl\n\nMore than anything she my friend\nIt ain't all about the skinsI don't ever want this to end", "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/a7b7673d21157cca3bfa69081a6157b7.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
