Microphones\nBringin nothin but that, Heat.... From the West Coast\nChase beats, Bone lyrics like Vito..... Corleone\nWe be runnin things so act like... You All know\nBoneyard can't be stop now\n\n[T-Bone]\nI'm not a Jehovah's witness\nBut I witness, for Jehovah\nBack in the day, the first to slang cane, and bakin soda\nBut nowadays I like preachin the Word\nLike a drug dealer slangin' Holy rock on the curb\nEyes blurred off the Holy Ghost\nContact smoke gotcha trippin of my rims, crushed ice and my rope\nPlus I'm gifted wit flows and wrist is frozen\nI thought you all knew dawg, I'm God's chosen\nHighly favored, standin wit the elite that stands apart dawg\nAnointed, bring the Word to the streets\nAin't entertainin the fame or the set you claimin\nThe game of namin, unless the name I'm namin\nIs Jesus on the throne and reignin', paintin a picture for G's bangin\nOn how the Lord can save em, train 'em like a Baltimore Raven\nEngravin the name of Jesus across their heart, cuz it's breakin\nPlus Satan is waitin, anticipatin and hatin but once we got em\nThere ain't no escapin\n\n[Hook]\n\n[T-Bone]\nI been doin this for 12 years, it ain't easy ya'll\nTo make hit records that are off the heazy ya'll\nEspecially when them bustas sippin on the haterade\nTalkin behind your back and tryin to stop ya on day to day\nI dont' make music for them playa hatas any way\nThis is for killers and thugs that's sippin on the Alize\nRun aways and ese's locked down in prison, why em\nThe one's in need of a physician and I know the perfect Doctor\nYa'll that can heal you when you answer to the altar call\nHe can fill all the emptiness and void in your heart\nThat's why I rhyme out of need and not for love of the art\nSo listen, my only mission is soul fishin\nSo when the rapture happens\nFaces will be on the back of milk cartons missin\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "T-Bone"}
