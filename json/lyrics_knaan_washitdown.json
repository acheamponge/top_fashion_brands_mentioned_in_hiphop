(What?)\nPeople need music like they need excuses (Ha)\nPeople need water like Kanye needs Jesus\n\nSo wash it down (wash it down)\nWash it down (wash it down)(x7)\n*gradually fades, continues in background*\n\n(Spoken) I know you stressin': this is a little meditation for you to relax\nAnd jump in the pool, and, you know, sink and sink!\n\nMy people drum on water\nDrink on water\nLive on water\nDie for water"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
