But it's OK\nI still hope and pray the status quo can change\nAnd I still scope the skies waiting for blokes in capes\nAnd I'll fly when I know how I'm supposed to behave\nSo won't you take a moment to show me the way\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAutism assisted me in becoming a poet\nBecause I feel deeply but I just struggle to show it\nI care for those around me though I don't know how I'm supposed to tell people\nSo I wrote it down, prepared my vocal sound\nThen shared my opus on open ground\nThose with this syndrome are endowed with a determination to succeed\nThat the non-Asperger brain often fails to achieve\nAnd yet we go off the rails easily, but believe me\nI've seen what we can be when we've got dreams to reach that no-one else can\nAnd piece by piece the diagnosed'll find the folks to help them\nTo aspire to the heights their sights are focused on\nI know it's a long fight but we're the type to go the whole hog\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2012-01-29"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
