The first line out, so\nHere we are eight years strong and still movin'\nGroovin with a reputation ya can't ruin\nI wanna take it back how it used to be\nFive thousand fucked up, rockin outta unity\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Xzibit]\nWas it the alcohol in you, the money the power the fame\nThat made you actually attempt to try to disgrace my name?\nPlayed those games nigga when I was younger in life\n'Til I seen another man's life cut short with a knife\nLose teeth, cause beef, no peace with us\nYa can't hang, and ya sho' can't eat with us\nWhen times get tough, the tough get rough and drastic\nNever been blasted, never been an arrogant bastard\nBut I coulda been a lawyer, I shoulda been a doctor\nI never been a actor, I'm nothin but a monster\nI move in silence, speak with violence\nThink with science, live free and walk with lions\nCats around me with gats like Yasser Arafat\nIt takes a nation of millions to hold me back\nPounds of cush to push what I'm talkin about\nIt's hard to talk the talk with a gauge in yo mouth\nIt's hard to walk the walk with ya back blew out\nDon't let the things that you can't change stress you out\nCause X take the money and run, and raise a man from a son\nAnd change the world with the power of one c'mon\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Xzibit"}
