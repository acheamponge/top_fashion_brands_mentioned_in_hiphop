(Information)\nWhen the truth comes down upon ya\nYou have to decide\n\n[Verse 1]\nInformation, we have to come with the laser scanners\nIn supermarkets and department stores\nAnd direct mail houses\nWere to record every single items we purchase\nData about ya daily habits\nAnd movements will flow into the beast system\nFrom spy satellites, constantly circling overhead\nWatching us like it\u2019s sporting\n6-6-6 database investigate\nEntire race heading for a cyber-space\nRiots breaks inside an Empire States\nEvery move you make is recorded on tape\nSome of us are wired prisoned behind gates\nHidden miniature videos in a brief case\n\n[Interlude]\nRecording our every activities: indoors, outdoors, day and night. Obscenely invaded our policy, our prophecies\n\n[Verse 2]\nStar gazin', cause Allah is far amazing\nThan any graven god of a pagan\nRaised in synagogues of Satan\nAwakened with the scar of a nation\nLeft beats scarred an shaken\nRobbed of education, my birth was foretold\nFrom deep within my wardrobe, embrace the crossroad\nWe once wore gold, but now we electric probes\nWith silicon brains, synthetic\nAll faces are strange, pathetic, check the eyes\nA man can\u2019t even recognise his family\nI blame it on humanity for this insanity\nSpy satellites, the last battle for life\nThere\u2019s no day or night, CIA\nTake samples of my DNA\nNew borns, grow horns, placed in uniforms\nShipped off to the military\nWith they killed and buried\n\n[Interlude]\nInteractive TV sets will be watching us, just as we watched them. They will also report back to the beast at computer headquarters. Our telephone conversations will be automatically wire tapped and transcripted by the national security agency\nHonesty, modesty\nPoverty, famine, the sons of Amman\nDeal with reprogramming, iris scanning\n\n[Verse 3]\nBreaking out of Satan\u2019s bondage with long garments\nLike we bionic, no longer paying homage\nRemember after \u20189-6 we wear biochips\nNow it\u2019s \u20189-7, beware of armageddon\nBloodsheddin\u2019 and beheadin\u2019\nHead on head collision in the valley of decisions\nWe locked the beast in prison\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere ya gonna run to?\nWhere you gonna hide?\nWhen the truth comes down upon you\nYou will have to to decide\nWhere ya gonna run to?\nWhere you gonna hide?\nWhen the truth comes down upon you\nYou will have to to decide\nWhen that time comes\nYou will have to decide\nInformation, information\nYou will have to decide\nInformation, where you gonna run to?\nWhere you gonna hide?\nWhen the truth comes down upon you\nYou will have to decide\nInformation, information\nInformation\n\n[Outro: sample]\nCan you help me? I\u2019m looking for a man\nA man? What's his name?\nJesus, I must warn him\nYou\u2019re too late, even now he\u2019s before Pilate\nThey found him\nHe was betrayed to them, and by one he loved and trusted, by his disciple, who sat at his left hand\nWhy?\nBecause men are weak, because the are cursed with envy and cowardice. Because they can dream of truth, but cannot live with it, because they doubt. They doubt, the fools. Why must men betray themselves with doubts? Tell them, the other, find them and tell them not to doubt. Even now not to doubt, tell them to keep their faith. They must keep faith\nWait, tell who? Who are you?\nMy name is Judas"}]}
