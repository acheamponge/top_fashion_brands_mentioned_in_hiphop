Rap for your first selection, get up on it\nTo my opponents, let me just demonstrate for a minute\nCrooks gettin' hooked, to my book, just like an addiction\nStop your diction you drop, the science fiction\nLet's get specific you can't get with it\nI'm too terrific and scientific, forget it\nDon't even try to limp it, you're not ready to make hits\nYou still got a learner's permit\nPoppin' that [shit], you better sit\nHere's a word, of a third degree burn, so listen and learn\nYou're missin' a turn, so you better get, concerned\nMy challenger, check the calendar\nI'm as live as a .45 caliber, Colt\nWith a silencer, wettin' up, suckers I be settin' up\nButton up, while I'm cuttin' up, never lettin' up\nI don't link up, with suckers with raps that shrank\nThanks sonny, I'm takin' money to the bank\n\n\"Money in the bank, yeahhhh\"\n\"Rocked and rolled, but then you rolled and rocked\"\n\"Money in the bank, yeahhhh\"\n\"Rocked and rolled, but then you rolled and rocked\"\n\"Money in the bank, yeahhhh\"\n\"Rocked and rolled, but then you rolled and rocked\"\n\nOne in the chamber, eight in the clip\nPull out a razor, watch your rhyme book rip\nIt's Ant Live, liver and deliveries get liver\nWith G. Rap, and we're the sole survivors\nMC's want to try me, but can't escape, my clutch\nToo much, caught in the ropes, like double dutch\nYou want to run up, you better run up light\nCause like a whorehouse shippin' out [pussy] tonight\nBelieve me I ain't goin' out like a brick parachute\nOr a fruit, or a guy that wears Brut\nCologne, I'm violent prone, so leave me alone\nI'm about to set fire to the microphone\nAnd leave the mic so hot you need potholders for this\nDue to burnt wires it's cordless\n(Yo Ant Live make suckers walk off the plank)\nNot now, I'm takin' money to the bank\n\n\"Money in the bank, yeahhhh\"\n\"Money in the bank, yeahhhh\"\n\"Money in the bank, yeahhhh\"\n\n\"Money in the bank, yeahhhh\"\n\"Money in the bank, yeahhhh\"\n\"Money in the bank, yeahhhh\""}], "artist": "Large Professor"}
