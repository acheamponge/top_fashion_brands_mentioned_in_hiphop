I've been here getting head new bitches in my bed every night nuttin' less\nCool, Hugh Heff', say less, But hurry up\nI've been watching these new yutes on YouTube\nAnd I don't care what anybody said there's nothing they can do You-you're the best\n\n[Verse 2: Dappy]\nWhen ever they're struggling to pay the bills\nSending for me might do them a favor still\nBut I ain't tryna write a whole diss track  1 Tweet bet I could get a Fascio a major deal\nBut if you violate and I mean violate\nI ain't gunna write nothin' back for ya'\nAct like nothin happen' I see you on the road squash it and chat to ya'\nI'll Batter ya'\nAnd if you put me on my bum i'll come back for ya' let the whole ends know it's gunna be mad for ya'\nI'm a good fella' but i'll have man sittin' outside your house for days like the mafia\nI can tell you how your mum looks right now\nLittle bro's in his room playing on COD\nSisters out the front playing with the cat\nSo If I were you I'd head back right now\nSpin the whip back round it's gunna go down\nCome with every man you know\nWhen they see the .44 hanging out the 4 door\nAll they'll remember is Vaffanculo\nYou can't fuck with me costga'\nCan't you tell by my posture I ain't no popstar\nWe've been doin' our thing way before the Tarzan thing\nCall me young Cosa Nostra", "year": "2015-12-25"}], "artist": "Dappy"}
