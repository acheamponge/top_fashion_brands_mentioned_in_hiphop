It does fly\nFast forward nine months and suddenly it\u2019s crunch time\nIt's been a few days of goin\u2019 through contractions\nGotta stopwatch timin' every moment that it happens\nWe reached five minutes so it\u2019s hospital time\nI call ahead to see the doctors arrive, my wife\u2019s laughin'\nNow I properly drive like the cops are behind\nBut there was barely any traffic so we got there in time\nI\u2019m a little scared, but she ain\u2019t got a worry in sight\nShe\u2019s a warrior, exactly what you want in a wife\nIt\u2019s been several days of epic pain, every day she wakes up\nFinally she's comin\u2019 to that second stage of labour\nI sit next to her, squeeze on her hand\nPut a sponge up on her head and say, \"Breathe if you can\nI love you so much, baby, you\u2019re so strong\nI could never do this but you so easily can\"\nShe said the pain is insane like her abdomen\u2019s ruptured\nLike someone\u2019s got a knife, and they\u2019re stabbin\u2019 her stomach\nShe\u2019s like \"We have to do somethin',\" the nurse said, \"It\u2019s natural\nRelax, it's just a sign that it\u2019s actually coming\"\nShe\u2019s like \"No, it\u2019s too much, it\u2019s too hard to get out\"\nI\u2019m sayin\u2019 any words I think\u2019ll help at calmin\u2019 her down\nDoctor\u2019s like, \"You\u2019re nearly through the worst part of it now\"\nTake a look and see my little king is startin\u2019 to crown\nThey all tellin\u2019 her to push, and she\u2019s screamin\u2019\nShe\u2019s saying that it hurts, I tell her to keep breathin\u2019\nIt\u2019s like \u2018push\u2019 is the only word that they\u2019ve said now\nThen I\u2019m shocked by the massive scream she lets out\nThe doctor\u2019s like \"Yes, now the head\u2019s out\"\nAnd then I watch as he quickly pullin' the rest out\nIt\u2019s so amazin\u2019 to see my son in the flesh\nI can\u2019t help but notice he hasn't taken a breath, now\nThey put a little plastic thing in his mouth\nWhile the doctor\u2019s two fingers are slightly pumpin\u2019 his chest down\nI start panicking, something\u2019s gone wrong\nThey push me to the side, I can barely see what\u2019s goin\u2019 on\nHe\u2019s not breathin\u2019, they need to resuscitate him\nHe\u2019s suffocating, I see that it\u2019s something major, I feel\nSo helpless, I wish I could come and save him\nI pray that my son\u2019ll make it, it\u2019s taking \u2018em fuckin\u2019 ages\nEveryone\u2019s in shock, I\u2019m just listenin\u2019 in\nHoldin\u2019 my breath, wishin\u2019 I could give it to him, fuck\nAt twenty minutes, now they\u2019re stoppin\u2019\nThey turn around, they say, \"We\u2019ve lost him\"\nI\u2019m in shock, I can\u2019t talk\nI\u2019m starin\u2019 at the ground, I can\u2019t walk\nThey hand him to us, can\u2019t believe the size of him\nThe most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen but there\u2019s no life in him\nMy wife\u2019s cryin\u2019 like, \"Why aren\u2019t they reviving him?\"\nI said, \"They tried for twenty minutes\" she\u2019s like, \"Try again\"\nNow I\u2019m feelin\u2019 like I\u2019m stuck in hell\nThis is the worst pain I\u2019ve fuckin\u2019 felt\nI\u2019ve been ten years clean, but now I\u2019m drunk and on the drugs as well\nI\u2019m doin\u2019 anything to numb myself, but nothin\u2019 helps\nI believed in God, for that I feel dumb as hell\nCan someone please tell God to go and fuck himself?\nI\u2019m sorry, yo, it\u2019s hard to be faithful\nIt's painful, heaven must be runnin\u2019 out of angels\nHe died from asphyxiation, no air in his lungs\nA parent should never have to bury their son\nEspecially one that\u2019s so precious it has barely begun\nThat\u2019s one thing in life that should never be done\nI prayed for a son, and they blessed me with one\nMy biggest gift, now his presence is up\nAnd I\u2019m crying at the thought, he won\u2019t ever feel a hug\nOr the tenderness of love that he\u2019d be gettin\u2019 from his mum\nSent him from above, but why take him?\nIt\u2019s like I'm being punished for the negative I\u2019ve done\nAnd it\u2019s killin\u2019 me that Christmas time is barely in a month\nSo I\u2019m doin\u2019 what I have to do to spend it with my son\n(No)\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere did you go?\nAre you alone?\nHow did you get there?\nI need you at home\nWhere did you go?\nAre you alone?\nHow did you get there?\nI need you at home\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI need you at home"}]}
