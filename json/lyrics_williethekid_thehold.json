I'm gone..\nI can't condone what these niggas doin'\nI can't complain either\nFlights out to Argentina\nI've seen enough to know enough\nWhen enough is enough\nYou can't block my puck\nI'm on the cusp with a cup\nStanley. This ain't hockey\nBut I'm ice-cold. Figure-8's\nMy Sixteens is quite bold\nBehold, the most excellent of word usage\n\n[Verse 2: Willie The Kid]\n\nNo discussion, only repercussion\nI reap the benefits, the lear lean like Robotussin\nOver-flustered, fluctuating like a fan-base\nThe Black Rembrandt\nBranch out, sketch a landscape\nRosemary on the lamb shank\nYou niggas shaky\nShaking hands, throw bands\nShe dance to Achy Breaky\nBroken-hearted artist starving\nOut of former union\nUnity, you better off\nWatch Petunias blooming\nIt costs more to pretend\nNiggas too timid\nIntimidating temporary plates\nI need motives\nDebating never, sipping Jameson\nEgyptian bitches, hieroglyphic how I script it\nSculpted in the image of a menace\nSo menacing, niggas been miniscule\nScan 'em like a scute number\nVisioning Aquariums\nJewels I'm wearing 'em\nAcquired taste, I'm preaching to the choir\nWired to a higher place\nReplaced passion\nComplacent, not a inkling\nMy bitches shimmy in sheer shirts\nBinge drinking. Cashmere Curtains\nEarn my money early\nBamboozled on stage\nNigga, show your pearlies\nWhite Remy,\nPlenty bitches at my tight and curlys\nBest friends, Laverne & Shirley\nFor sure nigga", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cd4ea7fd80f181076ebe17a7f0c9ecc3.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Somewhere.", "title": "The Hold"}]}
