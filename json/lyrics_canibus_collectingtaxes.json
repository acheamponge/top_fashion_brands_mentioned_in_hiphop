You wanna battle with a Jesus piece, you need luck\nYou couldn't see me with Jacob piece from Jesus\nI lean you back like your spine just cracked\nRhyme chiropractor get paid to adjust raps\nSpit somethin, let me see if I'mma bust back\nI front back gore yo' ass 'til you collapse\nSpin hats around lightspeed well hubcaps\nMy gun'll clap faster than Savion Glover taps\nWave the four at you, if it take more than that\nI kick down your door before you get the double axe\nStrapped for Canibus, just relax\nI came to collect taxes, as simple as that\nI raid your refrigerator, but other than that\nBefore I leave I remind you to remember you're whack\nYo my girl loves Usher but she said he gettin cocky\nI told her SHUT UP, cause that's the same way she knock me\nIn the name of hip-hop I rock beats on blocked streets\nThere ain't an MC that can stop me\nNeed more beats? Scott Storch ain't cheap\nIn Virginia, DMP or Nottz got heat\nYo, _I Get Around_ like 'Pac and Shock G\nIn a drop Jeep, lickin off shots at {?}\nIt don't have to be a special occasion, I'll be blazin\nI'm Jamaican, you know that I don't worship no bacon\n\nThis is real Canibus, leave your nose achin\nNiggas be hatin but on the low they know the flow's dangerous\nThe hip-hop Joe Namath, never missed a payment\nDon't say shit to me, talk to the niggas I came with\nKay Slay shit nigga, Drama King nigga\nBada Bing nigga..."}]}
