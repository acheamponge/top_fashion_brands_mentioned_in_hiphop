up, Quay\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Baby]\nI'm takin\u2019 off again, suicide doors, I won't let 'em in\nFour or five cars, livin\u2019 like a god, payin' for my sins\nAnd this life that I'm in important\nI can hop in the Benz, a foreign\nMarlo said they come in in the morning\nI got vibes, every state I got choices\nGucci coat like we stand on the corner with Mitch\nLike I'm straight out the 'partments, I'm rich as a bitch\nTakin' mine off the top, let lil' bro keep the difference\nPut an A in Atlanta, stand up for my city\nI was re-in\u2019 up daily, they thought I was kidding\nI was puttin\u2019 my profit up, saved me a milly\nI keep pourin' up Fantas so shit gettin\u2019 ridiculous\nHope the doctor don't say that I need a new kidney\n\n[Chorus: Lil Baby]\nPull up any kind of way I wanna\nShe know I got that dope boy persona\nDrop top, winter, spring, fall, or summer\nYoung niggas ballin' like we hit the numbers\nI done got the ball, I fuckin' cannot fumble\nStill duckin\u2019 the laws, I gotta keep on runnin'\nI be rockin' new shit, I got every color\nThis shit ain't enough, I need another come-up\nPull up any kind of way I wanna\nShe know I got that dope boy persona\nDrop top, winter, spring, fall, or summer\nYoung niggas ballin' like we hit the numbers\nI done got the ball, I fuckin' cannot fumble\nStill duckin' the laws, I gotta keep on runnin'\nI be rockin' new shit, I got every color\nThis shit ain't enough, I need another come-up\n\n[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]\nI fuck with Lil Baby, no infant (Uh)\nI used to make plays at the Quick Trip (I did)\nI spent a twenty on Quick Picks (Tell 'em)\nI run it back like a pick six (Woo)\nAdd it all up, it's a re-up, man\nI'm ballin', I need equipment (Ballin')\nI just bought a lift kit (Yeah)\nSaid she fell in love with a misfit (She love me)\nAnd fuck your opinion, you know how I'm livin'\nMy closet say, \"To be continued\" (Flooded)\nBack in the days I used to make plays\nAt Spondivits off of Virginia\nAin't no contender (Nah)\nTattoo my name on placentas (Woo)\nI breed a bitch like a kennel\nMade a half a mil' in a rental (Woo)\nAll of my verses suspenseful\nMy cuz a blood, menstrual\nHe draws down, pants\nI know that they care for your instrument\nI ball, I need me an agent\nI just might be your replacement (I might)\nI got a whole lot of money\nBut I got a little patience\nI got a whole lot of money\nBut I got a little patience (Alright)\nI got a whole lot of money\nBut I got a little patience\nMy bitch a trip, vacation\nToo many chains, plantation\nIf you a real nigga\nIt ain't no expiration\n\n[Chorus: Lil Baby & Gucci Mane]\nPull up any kind of way I wanna\nShe know I got that dope boy persona\nDrop top, winter, spring, fall, or summer\nYoung niggas ballin' like we hit the numbers\nI done got the ball, I fuckin' cannot fumble\nStill duckin' the laws, I gotta keep on runnin'\nI be rockin' new shit, I got every color\nThis shit ain't enough, I need another come-up\nPull up any kind of way I wanna\nShe know I got that dope boy persona\nDrop top, winter, spring, fall, or summer\nYoung niggas ballin' like we hit the numbers\nI done got the ball, I fuckin' cannot fumble\nStill duckin' the laws, I gotta keep on runnin' (Huh, Wop)\nI be rockin' new shit, I got every color\nThis shit ain't enough, I need another come-up (Go)\n\n[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]\nThey say Gucci's a criminal\nFlood my timepiece with emeralds (Burr)\nNot conserve' or no liberal\nDonate Rollies for Christmas (Huh)\nHeard I shop at Bal Harbor\nI spent reckless on denim (Wow)\nShe so fine, got her addy\nFucked, told my folks where to send her (Well damn)\nNew 'Rari, half an M\nSee the horse, know the emblem\nIt's Big Guwop, it's him\nAlways us over them (Fuck 'em)\nNiggas say they gon' do this and that\nThen duck when I see 'em (Huh)\nDon't compare me to Slim\nI could never be him (No)\nCopped so many new baguettes\nThat I'm gettin' sick of myself (Bling)\nBig bully, crushed my peers\nSo now I pick on myself (Huh)\nHighly decorated soldier, I got hits on my belt\nBig diamond choker chokin' on me, man like Conor McGregor (It's Gucci)\n\n[Chorus: Lil Baby]\nPull up any kind of way I wanna\nShe know I got that dope boy persona\nDrop top, winter, spring, fall, or summer\nYoung niggas ballin' like we hit the numbers\nI done got the ball, I fuckin' cannot fumble\nStill duckin' the laws, I gotta keep on runnin'\nI be rockin' new shit, I got every color\nThis shit ain't enough, I need another come-up\nPull up any kind of way I wanna\nShe know I got that dope boy persona\nDrop top, winter, spring, fall, or summer\nYoung niggas ballin' like we hit the numbers\nI done got the ball, I fuckin' cannot fumble\nStill duckin' the laws, I gotta keep on runnin'\nI be rockin' new shit, I got every color\nThis shit ain't enough, I need another come-up"}], "artist": "Lil Baby"}
