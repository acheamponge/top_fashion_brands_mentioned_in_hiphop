I can tell by swagg she's a number one stunna girl. Been around the whole world, and i ain't never seen no hustler girl\nMy numba one hustler girl (3x)\nLittle shorty hold me down\nEven when i'm not around\nRollin' in and outta town\nSo i gotta get a crown to my number one hustler girl\nTo my number one hustler girl\nAnd she all about her queen fly, when she hit the scene\nI done been around the world. And, i ain't never seen her\nMy number one hustler girl\nShe my number one hustler girl\n\n1st verse:\nUh, sometimes i get higher to cope with reality. I'm a hustler and ain't nobody bad as me, nah. Metaphorically, heavy strategy\nThoughts through my mind that be caused cause of agony\nListening to great telling me to say somethin' . Still i says nothin' cause i know they can't tackle me (keep running, uh yeah). They came back with me. Home runner. Home slugga (??)\n, Home actually, with myself like Dorothy and the great wizzard. Knocked out, punch game is exquisit. When i'm in the ring, i can't see the pain. I just shine like MJ and Billy Jean. Bring fire to the camp.....(???) (explosion)\nBurn rings like ring... (??). Ya'll hail for the day i rain. Till i make it flood. Young never came. Yeah\nEverytime i see her she be countin' that money. I can tell by swagg she's a number one stunna girl. Been around the whole world, and i ain't never seen no hustler girl\nMy numba one hustler girl (3x)\nLittle shorty hold me down\nEven when i'm not around\nRollin' in and outta town\nSo i gotta get a crown to my number one hustler girl\nTo my number one hustler girl\nAnd she all about her queen fly, when she hit the scene\nI done been around the world. And, i ain't never seen her\nMy number one hustler girl\nShe my number one hustler girl\n\n2nd verse:\nIt's a new day and age. Rugrats grown up. Last bagony (??). Ya'll gone shown up (see how the story's spin around) go nuts. When I peel out. Dust. And it's over. Who ya'll gon' call?. Ghostbusters. The big or the small. Brooklyn. Where we ball baby ball. Out, till it hurt and we fall. Karate kid, limp it out. Bring your set. Dip it out. Who's stoppin' me. Nobody. Er'body love Er' Er' body, godmommy. Pushing 2'45, bulgatty. Featherweight, lean body. Ghost, can't see me. Hustling hard. Make it look easy\nEverytime i see her she be countin' that money. I can tell by swagg she's a number one stunna girl. Been around the whole world, and i ain't never seen no hustler girl\nMy numba one hustler girl (3x)\nLittle shorty hold me down\nEven when i'm not around\nRollin' in and outta town\nSo i gotta get a crown to my number one hustler girl\nTo my number one hustler girl\nAnd she all about her queen fly, when she hit the scene\nI done been around the world. And, i ain't never seen her\nMy number one hustler girl\nShe my number one hustler girl\nListen, If you grind all day you's a hustler girl\nPut ya hands in tha air if you a hustler girl\nCause if you grind all day you's a hustler girl\nSo put your hands in tha air if you's a hustler girl\nCause if you grind all day and all night, from sundown to the sunrise\nYou's a hustler girl, you's a hustler girl\nCause if you grind all day you's a hustler girl\nSo put your hands in the air if you's a hustler girl. Hustler girl\nEverytime i see her she be countin' that money. I can tell by swagg she's a number one stunna girl. Been around the whole world, and i ain't never seen no hustler girl\nMy numba one hustler girl (3x)\nLittle shorty hold me down\nEven when i'm not around\nRollin' in and outta town\nSo i gotta get a crown to my number one hustler girl\nTo my number one hustler girl\nAnd she all about her queen fly, when she hit the scene\nI done been around the world. And, i ain't never seen her\nMy number one hustler girl\nShe my number one hustler girl"}], "artist": "Lil\u2019 Mama"}
