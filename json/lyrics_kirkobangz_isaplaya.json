Some skinny and tall, and yellow and purple, like them almond brown\nMy seats recline. I'm dicking her down, I hit that from behind. When I'm on my grind she texting saying this dick is on her mind\nHer nigga tripping never fuck her he just beat her down. So shit I slide in put nine in then I leave the town\nDon't beat around. Don't leave around no evidence. See I get high then I come down, my dick is heaven sent\nThen she got that picture so she started getting on that other shit. Trying to get her nigga back in check so she started telling shit\nLike \" Yeah I'm fucking him and he do me better than you.\" When that's a nigga that I know, no trip cause we ain't cool\nWent through this shit with the same nigga back in grade school. But see back then he use to hate on me I played the fool\nThen I fucked this nigga main bitch eight years later ooooh. I played it cool. Don't try to play me like a fool\nAnd then this bitch went and got all up in her feelings, trying to make him jealous\nWent on the internet and told some people she was pregnant, and said Bangz after that. Like the kid was mine\nThen admitted she lied, man my dick got bitches loosing they mind\n\n[Hook]"}]}
