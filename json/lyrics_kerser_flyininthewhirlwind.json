It ain't that hard to work out\nSippin' lean makes it hard to spit the words out\nI'm just tryna paint a picture with my vocab\nAnd put your mind inside of mine, you see I'm so smashed\n\n[Chorus]\nGod give us time, 'cause I'm flyin' in the whirlwind\nWonderin' what's for me when the world ends\nBright lights, fast cars, this my life now\nMy brain on, but they sayin' that the light's out\nGod give us time, 'cause I'm flyin' in the whirlwind\nWonderin' what's for me when the world ends\nBright lights, fast cars, this my life now\nMy brain on, but they sayin' that the light's out\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm in my car again, off my head on medicine\nYou're askin' me? I ask myself if it will ever end\nI take the blame and blame the fame at the same time\nI didn't realise just how much it can change life\nAnd I ain't whingin' 'cause the dollars help it weigh-out\nI'm just givin' you perspective with a blade out\nThat's when it burst and it feelin' like a sudden rush\nI'm seein' red, all I want to do it cut a cunt\nThey mark my name so I guess it never dirt clean\nRemember Sero stabbed a cunt when he was thirteen\nDon't you talk about my crew way before the fame\nYou wouldn't know, that's why we die over ABK\nIf this the bible then I'm writin' down a scripture\nAnd make a fan out of every single listener\nOnce a Kers fan, guarantee a fan forever\nFunny how it took a jail visit to get the fam' together\n\n[Chorus]\nGod give us time, 'cause I'm flyin' in the whirlwind\nWonderin' what's for me when the world ends\nBright lights, fast cars, this my life now\nMy brain on, but they sayin' that the light's out\nGod give us time, 'cause I'm flyin' in the whirlwind\nWonderin' what's for me when the world ends\nBright lights, fast cars, this my life now\nMy brain on, but they sayin' that the light's out\n\n[Bridge]\nThought we had it all till I seen my brothers fall\nAnd it's feelin' like \"No Rest\" again, we've done it all\nDepression and anxiety, most hide quietly, others act violently\nI do 'em all, a sight to see\nGave my life to rap, I really sacrificed it all\nWas on tour so I missed it when my daughter crawled\nI'm fucked up and I hate public places\nThe sacrifice I made engraved me as the greatest\n\n[Chorus]\nGod give us time, 'cause I'm flyin' in the whirlwind\nWonderin' what's for me when the world ends\nBright lights, fast cars, this my life now\nMy brain on, but they sayin' that the light's out\nGod give us time, 'cause I'm flyin' in the whirlwind\nWonderin' what's for me when the world ends\nBright lights, fast cars, this my life now\nMy brain on, but they sayin' that the light's out"}], "artist": "Kerser"}
