Made a pun\n\n[Chorus: Miracle of Sound]\nEver since I rang the bells\nAnd lit the flame\nNothing else will break the spell\nThey just don't feel the same\n\n[Verse 3: Dan Bull]\nSwinging a drake sword into a Gravelord\nUntil he falls like a kid on a skateboard\nIt isn't as straightforward as giving him pain\nCausing misery ain't all this business takes\nYour role's to be cunning, while rolling and running\nControlling your thumb like you're holding a bomb and defusing it\nIf you got a weapon then I hope you're using it\nTill we know whether you're a genius or a lunatic\nSo why you measuring your penis with a ruler if\nIt's only seven millimetres? Jesus, these demons hit hard\nBut me I'm releasing sick bars in a ceaseless discharge\nI didn't want to tell you the cold hard truth\nBut I can't keep a secret this large\nYou died, you died, you died, you died, you died\nKeep practising and you'll be good in time\nEven if you have to stick down a Summon Sign\nAsking for help? Man, I wish a prick would\nBecause all would tell them is to get good\n\n[Chorus: Miracle of Sound]\nEver since I rang the bells\nAnd lit the flame\nNothing else will break the spell\nThey just don't feel the same\n\n[Verse 4: Dan Bull]\nI'm just chilling in the catacombs and I'm back in vogue\nI'm a maiden, a dame: Fashion Souls\nThey're invading my game, then I'm bashing trolls\nEvading the pain with some barrel rolls\nYeah! Rolling, rolling, rolling\nKilling everything that's got a soul in\nSticking a pole in Gwyndolin's colon\nWhere the Dark Sun don't shine (Ha!)\nLeave him with a really raw hide in in the rear\nMad as if he caught me riding Gwynevere\nThere's never really anything as real as the first game\nYou'll remember when you're entering the Kiln of the First Flame\nFace Lord Gwyn and then end the ages\nPut pen to pages and amend some changes\nSaying, \"Sorry, fellas, there's some heavy lay-offs\nWe're getting rid of the Bed of Chaos\"\nGive a painful hit to the Grey Wolf Sif\nFeed him chocolate, give a Gravelord shit\nCame across a bonfire, and I gotta light it\nAyy, this bonfire's lit\n\n[Chorus: Miracle of Sound]\nEver since I rang the bells\nAnd lit the flame\nNothing else will break the spell\nThey just don't feel the same", "year": "2018-05-01"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
