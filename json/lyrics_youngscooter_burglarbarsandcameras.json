I got it\nGet your calculator out with Scooter on the beat\nI get them pounds for thirteen hundred and sell 'em for the three\nI made more than the plug, street lottery\nJugg king, I just did a show for a key\nI got six jugg houses on the same street\nI got six plugs and they ain't got the same weed\nYou call your  partner big dog, he won't even let you eat\nI get on every beat nigga and rap a recipe, Scooter\n\n[Chorus]\nBurglar bars and cameras, baking soda and Arm & Hammer\nBlack Amigo numbers got the trap goin' bananas\nBurglar bars and cameras, baking soda and Arm & Hammer\nBlack Amigo numbers got the trap goin' bananas\nI can make the trap jump when the trap slow\nPacks comin' in the front, right out the back door\nBurglar bars and cameras, baking soda and Arm & Hammer\nBlack Amigo numbers got the trap goin' bananas\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got the keys, the keys\nRemix for twenty-three\nRolex off jugg houses\nAnd everything for cheap\nStill juggin' off public housing\nLike eighty racks a week\nStash house in Stone Mountain\nThat I don't never see\nNever let a nigga know when your pack comin'\n'Cause niggas come and intercept that pack like Josh Norman\nA half a million worth of cars and everything foreign\nThey dropped the price of bricks nigga and I'm to blame for it\nEleven hundred gram bricks, they cost an extra stack\nTurn a nine to a half, an extra nine on top of that\nHit the club and buy the bar, you know we stand on top of that\nBitch I'm always in the streets, I out here where the robbers at\n\n[Chorus]\nBurglar bars and cameras, baking soda and Arm & Hammer\nBlack Amigo numbers got the trap goin' bananas\nBurglar bars and cameras, baking soda and Arm & Hammer\nBlack Amigo numbers got the trap goin' bananas\nI can make the trap jump when the trap slow\nPacks comin' in the front, ran out the back door\nBurglar bars and cameras, baking soda and Arm & Hammer\nBlack Amigo numbers got the trap goin' bananas", "album": "Jugg King", "year": "2017-07-17", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a6d2844a40389e5805e6e768a6d3d0f2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young Scooter"}
