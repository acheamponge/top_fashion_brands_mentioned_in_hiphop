Because when this masquerade is finally over I want to be remembered for who I am. Not who I was or who I wanted to be, cus this right here, this is me, so follow this]\n\nEven though I've never called it perfect\nWhen I die, I want to know it all was worth it\nI want to know that I tried my best with\nEmbracing every moment that I was blessed with\nEvery life, every death, every time that I wept\nEvery moment, every person, every lie that I said\nEvery night, every day, every time every place\nEvery kiss, every wish, every side of the maze\nEvery cut, every bruise, every love that I'd lose\nEvery time that I broke and the times that I grew\nEvery drop of rain that these clouds would spew\nTo help form the man that I amounted to\nAnd I'm thankful, that I am who I am\nAnd I've been where I've been and I came out grateful\nWhen it's finally time to make an exit\nJust know, that I don't regret a single second\n\nThis is the exception to everything\nThis is the exception to everything\n(Repeat x6)", "album": "The Balancing Act"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
