Come here, let me talk to you\n\nMercedes and marijuana in LA it's only right my Ferrari's in California\nI'm wavy kowabunga\nLighting a sour blunt up you need the power to conquer\nTalk powder like what's your numbers? Tell me something good diners need something to pull\nCan't fill something that's full\nI'm always in something hood, posted in someone's hood\nDon't get it F'd up, nothing to pull a F up\n700 who want it? Gun on you, you wouldn't step up\nHit from the neck up 40 can lift his tek up\nNaked in just his drawers like when ya boy get a check up?\nShe the bomb in the Manolo's while we snipping a photo we John Lennon & Yoko\nAt the bar sitting in Polo, blunt in the ashtray\nI'm a star I didn't know though\n\nCome on let me take you on a NY Ride\nMove side to side let ya body glide\nSlime, slime, slime, slime x2\n\nChampagne spilled another man killed, homocide stressin'\nBack", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/e2d9824f3848684bc687e9cad8889c34.687x595x1.jpg"}]}
