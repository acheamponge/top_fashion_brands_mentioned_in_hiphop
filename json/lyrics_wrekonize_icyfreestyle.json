Still tuned in till the new year\nStill repping through for the Wreking Crew\nDo you wanna stay for a few beers\nI'm bout to bounce but before I do don't count me out\nDon't look me over don\u2019t doubt the clout\nAfter 24 you need to mouth to mouth\nSometimes I\u2019m running on fumes but\nI just keep running and running on\nI heard em say that I'm doomed but\nThey can\u2019t see that I been running long\nThey just a bunch of cartoon sluts\nTrying to be real with the puppet arm\nStuffed in they fucking cartoon guts\nI just can't love how they rub it wrong\nSee me I'm trying to figure out\nHow to get me just a little clout\nHow to get me just a little game\nHow to just take it a different route\nHow to let more of you know the name\nLetting you know just what I'm about\n24 weeks was in the aim\n28 left to feed a drought", "title": "Icy (Freestyle)", "year": "2019-06-12", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/d100c818847d98a77136b5192bbd09e5.700x700x1.jpg"}]}
