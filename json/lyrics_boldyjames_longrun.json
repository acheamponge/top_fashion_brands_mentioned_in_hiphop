Who is this? Where the fuck is Boldy?\nDawg working with the feds, trynna put them on me)\nGot popped with a brick and some mark money\nGot off with intent, did a 1 to 20\nFor snitching on my cuddy, nigga had it coming to him\nI fell off, but bounced back like Silly Putty (Big Dummy!)\nI risked fed time for this money\nIt's concreatures\nHellblock, hully gully\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen my back is against the wall\nWhat happens if it should fall?\nI live for today, but pray for a better tomorrow\nCrack is against the law\nWhat happens if you get caught?\nFor selling that yay? And they send you behind the wall?\nWhy would you risk it all?\nMoochie, I've been through it all\nMight as well give it all to me, I can move it all\nMagical with the wand, don't panic when it dissolve\nThat's just its purest form, no additives but the Arm and Hammer\nWhen whip it hard, the hammer is a revolver\nJam it like that's my song, they play it in rental cars\nTraffic and bricks of raw, bird play, chicken talk\nI know Sergei and I ain't talking Fedorov\nNiggas with jealous hearts turn state, tip you off\nDon't even know what a chirp weigh, or what it costs\nAfter a get it off, first base, second, walk\nStole third base, heading home, finna score a homerun\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/06f819733860ea6f65fb77cc4e85eb44.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
