It is time to release the Kraken!\n\n[Verse 1: Danny Sexbang]\nLook in the distance\nBeyond the castle gates\nThe armies of the damned have come\nOn the horizon\nThey gather beneath the blood-red sun\nThe blood-red sun\n\nA thousand warriors\nDemons and orcs\nCharging like a tornado\nBut they will never know\nThat their death awaits in waves below\nIn the waves below\n\n[Spoken Interlude 1: Danny Sexbang]\nWe must now unleash the monster\nMay God forgive us!\n\n[Chorus: Danny Sexbang, Brian Wecht]\nRelease the Kraken!\nHey, guys!\nThe tolling of the iron bell\nRelease the Kraken!\nI'm the Kraken!\nRising from the depths of hell\nGraaaah--ack! *coughing*\nDoes anyone have a Lozenge?\n\n[Verse 2: Danny Sexbang]\nOut on the battlefield\nThe armies collide\nAnd hundreds die where they stand\nIn screaming agony\nThe shadow of war across the land\nAll across the land\n\nNow let's end the fight\nIt's time to decide\nWhose blood will finally be spilled\nOur secret weapon\nA specter of hate who's born to kill\nHe was born to kill\n\n[Spoken Interlude 2: Danny Sexbang]\nThe time is now! Go forth, Kraken! Leave nothing but corpses!\n\n[Chorus: Danny Sexbang, Brian Wecht]\nRelease the Kraken!\nI'm in a song!\nA creature of Satanic rage\nRelease the Kraken!\nWho wants sandwiches?\nBursting from its sunken cave\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Spoken Interlude 3: Arin Hanson, Brian Wecht]\nRelease the Kraken!\nHey, look, I found a bell!\n\n[Chorus: Danny Sexbang, Brian Wecht]\nRelease the Kraken!\nDING DING DING DING DING DING DING DING!\nImpervious to sword and bow\nRelease the Kraken!\nI've got a splinter\nDeath incarnate from below\nRelease the Kraken!\nOops, I falled over!\nAll shall drown in his domain\nRelease the Kraken!\nSplishy-splashy!\nThe harbinger of fear and pain\n\n[Spoken Outro: Danny Sexbang, Brian Wecht]\nWell, you did nothing. The war is lost. Thanks, Kraken\nYou're welcome!"}], "artist": "Ninja Sex Party"}
