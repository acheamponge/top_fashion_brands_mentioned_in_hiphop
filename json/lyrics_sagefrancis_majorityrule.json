For permanent bliss\nIt seems cool, only if you suffer from eternal ignorance\nInternal innocence rejects external filth. Hurdle the guilt\nMy ancestors left. Dress with a traditional kilt\nCurdled milk that's under suspicion will get spilt\nAin't no use crying. Who's lying about the empire I built?\nAnother self proclaimed historian\nWith Einstein as his passenger, and a flux capacitor in his Delorean\nRewrote my past, taught me sin\nWhen we spoke at last he caught me in the chin\nThere was no need to ask, I know he fought me to win\nMy broken task is born again, let a new war begin\nI think he saw me grin. Played my ass like a sucka\nTurned that brunch between me and my father into our last supper\n\n[Hook]\nHe'll take us back, take take us back\nHe'll take us back, take take us back (Take us back back!)\nHe'll take us back, take take us back\nHe'll take us back, take take us back (W-W-W-Way Back!)\nSee, cuz it's twisted..\nIn the future, scientists will prove that we never even existed\n\n[Verse Two]\nSo now I'm orphaned into this world of a rewritten past\nWhere they force my girl to clean and force me to sit in class\nThe teacher laughs as he preaches math, beats me with a staff\nBecause the text we read expects us to bleed each paragraph\nI speed through the chapter fast. My prospectful wife\nHangs her pride at half mast, force fed domestic life\nIs giving her a fat ass...she can't eat no more\n\"We'll see who laughs last\" is what she speaks so sure\nAs she sweeps the floor\nHer bare feet are sore. I'd massage her toes\nBut she's way too busy doing dirty laundry and washing my clothes\nThis bastard ass took us back to the dark ages\nMy heart races. He's got 1 out of 3 blacks locked in cages\nSage is heading for the mic, but they blocked the stages\nDopes took his notebook, said \"Don't look!\" as they blotched the page\nIgnoramuses must have \"idio-dildos\" stuck up in their anuses\nDominatrixes explain how pleasurable of a pain this is\nI ain't with this game of his.I'm looking for a loophole\nJust because you look the part, don't mean you can play, ask Manute Bol\nMy absolute role is to save whatever is left of me\nThe last of my true soul, so I dress up like the referee\nTo get the coach on every bench pissed\nThey approach me with a clenched fist\nSo I throw up their past lives and say, \"Catch this!\"\nThey get the drift, but fans rush the court\nPropaganda programs they hold in their hands\nBrain washed and flushed their thought\nNow it's a blood sport. My girl ain't with this strange land\nShe was fronting like a cheerleader as she figured out the game plan\nMade peeks at play sheets, memorized them like the Rain Man\nConducted her own brain scan, then reversed the chain of command\n\"She learned the formulas?\" The story is unraveling\nShe seduced Einstein by dressing up like Marilyn..\nMonroe. now she's got a Manson look in her eyes\nAnd a grin that's stretching so wide.damn, son, I'm petrified!\n\n[Hook]\nShe'll take us back, take take us back\nShe'll take us back, take take us back (Take us back back!)\nShe'll take us back, take take us back\nShe'll take us back, take take us back(W-W-W-Way Back!)\nSee, cuz it's twisted..\nIn the future scientists will prove that we never even exsssss....", "album": "Still Sick...
