I'm about to get a Grammy and leave\n\nMichael Jordan in ma genes since I been 23\nExcept, I ain't ball playin' at all, sayin' da bol\nGave all it the game, he played it wrong\nMade the songs for the laughs 'cause\nFunny was the path but\nNow I really wanna fuck these dummies in they asses\n\nPracticed\nTell me I ain't climbing up that rap list\nI bet a lot of fans'll listened to this and feel catfished\n\nDamn, where da Dicky dat I used to know?\nThe goofy flow\nMa dude, where the humor go?\n\nWell truth be told, I'll put that in a movie, show, or musical\nBut now I'm in the studio\nAnd dudes in the booth knew that the Jew can flow\nAnd if you listenin to this shit, you should know\nI'm too cold in this bitch\nTo be actin' a clown\nFuckin' around\nIf I wanna get ma hands on the crown\nI'm getting down, letting the smile, beset to a frown now\nThe kid up from the burbs 'bout to settle in downtown\nBut maybe that's a bad move\nMaybe I'm a fucking pussy\nIf I'm letting people tell me what I can't do\nMaybe all these rappers wanna wear the same shoes\nGet into the game and never playing 'cause they can't move\n\nNow I'm thinkin' what would Jordan do?\nBack when everybody only wore a boring shoe\nIf he settled for what every other scorer used\nThen you dudes wouldn't ever get the Jordan 2s\n\nI'm snoring through, ya muthafuckin tours and tunes\nThe game needs change now, it's short a few\n\nAnd I don't mean to harp about the Jordan dude\nBut there's a little bit of him in this adoring Jew\n\nOf course you, listen to that thinkin' I mean I'm great\nYou mistake, thinkin' of rap and I what I want a play\n\nJ wanted baseball\nBut he nice at playin' ball\nWhen he went away we acting like he went all AWOL\n\nAlways got a trade off\nI see Jay and Kanye the same way I see Larry David\n\nIt's clich\u00e9\nAnd I know I'm gon' make it\nBut I dunno if I prefer as Dicky or as David\n\nI guess it's sorta like the Sox and Bulls\nBut I can't leave yet, gotta lot to prove\nBut I'ma rock ma shoes, watch the toes\nAnd if it hurts, then I'ma find Dr. Scholl's\nAnd...one day, I'ma find satisfaction from rappin'\nOr acting, or cracking up factions of black kids\nAdapting, to whatever is in front of me\nAnd like Mike, I'ma be aight because of me\n\nOne life, better think of who you wanna be\nIt's your eyes, doesn't matter what they wanna see\n\nYou do it right, you the only one you need to please\nYou ain't that alive 'til you doin' something you believe\n\nDis the type of shit that's making D\nThink twice bout the mafuckin comedy\n'cause the mic got a mafucka on his knees\n\nTwerk Dicky, Dicky Dicky twerk\nTwerk Dicky, Dicky Dicky twerk"}], "artist": "Lil Dicky"}
