We, we straight street.  Let\u2019s go.  Yeah.  Once again.  [?] Boogie.  This right here is C-Rayz Walz.  [?] Triad.  Let\u2019s go\n[C-Rayz Walz]\nRunaway, runaway, runaway slave theory.  (Stronghold!  Stronghold!).  Yeah.  C-Rayz if you hear me.  Sun Cycle.  You\u2019re too close if you near me.  \u201cT.O.P.\u201d  I\u2019m your brother\u2014don\u2019t fear me.  People Army spaced out with particles galore.  Studio 116, \u201cArticles of War.\u201d  Triad, Triad\u2019s in locks.  \u201cArticles of War.\u201d  Read the pages, yo\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nYo, perfect timing.  (What?).  Is it worth it rhyming?\nWell, I\u2019m working, grinding as a person trying\nI sip my drink.  Multitalented, I think\nHow my peoples on the brink living extinct\nYou know who grab the microphone and flow no pranks\nStrong enough to go butt-naked with rocks against tanks\nYou don\u2019t understand my block harassed by cops\nWho wanna feel my balls like they searching for rocks?\n(Yeah) Yeah, I know.  Yeah, they searching for knots\nI\u2019m thirsting to pop\u2014another missing person, bursting the shot\nFrom the Glock.  Attack in slow motion\nCommotion stops.  Stronghold coaching your plot\nMake a toilet post up when we approach ya\n(C-Rayz) I\u2019m not interested in your toaster roaster\nBut this 9 will Park your mind like you testing Rosa\nGet up!  Get out your seat!  It\u2019s over\nWe not friends \u2018cause you rap.  Don\u2019t give me your DAT\nCut the wax?  Nah, I got samurai swords for that\nChop your head off with a tap from my finger\nY\u2019all cats raps \u2018cause y\u2019all can\u2019t be singers (Slap)\nThis is off my rack now like my hat to the back\nTrack-my-hairline rhyme\u2014the mind goes back\nYeah, I\u2019m looking just like my pops\nAnd I swing like him\u2014this time, it\u2019s minus the rocks\nI smuggle the microphone inside clubs to rock\nI guess both of us really have a talent to rock\nMost brothers try to escape the block by\nGoing to rock or pushing rock\nSee, we all pushing the rocks, kicking the dirt\nYou got a better chance pushing the rock, putting in work\nYou might score if you get a chance to take a shot\nBut don\u2019t stop.  Hot hip hop\u2019s flagrant\nBut they make you rock for a CIA agent\nThe way I rock make your eyes puffy when I see ya\nAnd they can\u2019t hold me down like Mumia\nOn the move like John with a magic wand\nYou don\u2019t want to go against them ancients, human pawn\nRunning calm \u2018til he jumps over your picket fence\nLike a native sorceress, mystic, intense\nIn both songs, y\u2019all were speeding, your eyes bleeding\nWatching me playing with crystal in Eden\nTen naked queens giving me [?] with great [feet and?]\nI ain\u2019t even steaming seeing they bodies like that (Know what?)\nI seen it before (Seen it).  I know how to rap and act (What?)\nSo don\u2019t be confused by my diamond shining, cuz\nNo shit represent the power of love\nAnd the pearls is Tahitian.  Keep breathing\nI\u2019m Mars.  You bitch niggas is from Venus, penis\nI\u2019m ill like rocking Mecca in Mecca\nDrinking tangerine nectar in the Cabo sector\nSpitting skill with sound but found found weapons\nRepping with an ill roundhouse like Tekken\nSo do the knowledge.  It\u2019s not a game in a booth\nThe Sun Cycle.  I explain truth to the youth\nWrote the verse in a hearse across from a church\nHad to drop the pen.  Hold my head.  Thoughts burst lead\nFirst thorough borough bread\u2014the golden egg worth it\nThe purpose: rehearse death \u2018til I live perfect\nGoose gander.  \u201cGod Geography\u201d grips the globe\nLeviathan lust got you stuck with swole lymph node\nLost souls soak up scrolls through Morse code\nAnd sip a six pack from Satan\u2019s torso\n\n[Outro: [?] and C-Rayz Walz]\nHuh.  \u201cGod Geography.\u201d  \u201cGod Geography.\u201d  \u201cGod Geography.\u201d  The body and the mind at the same in time (Time).
