Young M.A already got it\nAnd while I hit it from the back I did my two step\nPretty nigga scooping bitches like a pool net\nMy gold grill make 'em coons wets\nThe same niggas I ain't never wear the noose at\nIf your money ain't right nigga move left\nYou broke niggas talk more but you do less\nSee me I'm on my calm shit\nHit the club, nothing fancy, just a comfort\nNever slippin' though, I keep that fire on me quick\nI'm 'bout that action nigga, I don't do the arguments\nBut anyway I came here on my party shit\nCome and get your bitch, she on that naughty shit\nShe say she wanna take me in the bathroom and give me dome\nShe say she came her with you but wanna take me home\nAnd I said bitch, you ain't even bad though\nBut I ain't gon' lie, shawty had a fat ass though\nThat Henny in my system\nAin't no tellin', will I fuck 'em, will I diss 'em?\nShittin' on me, I probably fuck 'em then dismiss 'em\nI don't fall in love, I don't hug 'em, I don't kiss 'em\nAnd after I done had 'em I don't want 'em, I don't miss 'em\nAnd then I hit my two step\nCause I don't never sweat a bitch, I'm too cool for that\nShe turned that ass around and she threw it back\nI know exactly what to do with that\nShout out to the strippers and the bartenders\nY'all the real MVP cause y'all all winners\nFuck the pole, bring that ass on the top of me\nThat's the only way you getting dollars out of me\nThrow a couple stacks, show you probably three\nDependent on how that pussy pop for me\nAnd I ain't saying be a thot for me\nBut for this money girl you got to do a lot for me\n\n[Hook]\nThat's my Henny dance\nBust my Henny dance on these bitches\nBust my Henny dance on these bitches\nBust my Henny dance\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got that Ros\u00e9 and Henny\nGot Ciroq with the Remy\nGot the Gray Goose but that deuce deuce got me dizzy\nGot Patron, no chase\nI drink all my liquor straight\n1800 to the face, I just drink drink drink\nAnd I like my bitches straight\nI go hard in the paint\nBeat the pussy 'til she faint\nShe'll be gay when she wake\nI work hard every day, I don't ever take a break\nIrrelevant if it don't pay, I'm 'bout my cake cake cake\nAnd then I bust my two step\nScreaming fuck the police, where the goons at?\nAll my niggas eating good like the food net\nShawty topped the whole team, call it crew neck\nYeah, Brooklyn be the city bitch\nOf course I got a bunch of Brooklyn niggas with me\nEverything lit, everything litty\nEverything grit, everything gritty\nI hit my Henny dance on 'em\nFuck a hater, when I'm drunk I ignore 'em\nTell her twerk that ass, I'll reward her\nBitch, I'm off that dirty water\n\n[Hook]\nDo my Henny dance, do my Henny dance\nBust my Henny dance\nI do my Henny dance, do my Henny dance\nBoy I bust my Henny dance\nTell her turn around for them bands\nThen I do my Henny dance\nBitch I told her turn around for them bands\nThen I do my Henny dance\nGot a bottle of that Henny in my hand\nGot a bottle of that Henny in my hand\nThen I do my Henny dance, do my Henny dance\nDo my Henny dance, do my Henny dance", "album": "M.A The Mixtape", "year": "2014-12-30", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7441e7d1f3478922c9112bd215826a1b.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young M.A"}
