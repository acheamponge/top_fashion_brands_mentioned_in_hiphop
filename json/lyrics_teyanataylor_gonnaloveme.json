And squeeze me\nAre you gonna love? And squeeze me\nAnd oh, you're gonna love me\nYou're gonna wanna hug me\nAre you gonna hold me?\nAnd squeeze me, squeeze me\nAnd oh, you're gonna love me\nYou're gonna wanna hug me\nYou're gonna wanna hold me\nAnd squeeze me, and squeeze me"}], "artist": "Teyana Taylor"}
