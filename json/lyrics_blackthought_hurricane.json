Brown]\nSame story, same target, different time\nCyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind\nTrying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind\nWaiting for redemption, surviving in a bind\nSame story, same target, different time\nCyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind\nTrying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind\nWaiting for redemption, surviving in a bind\n\n[Verse 1: Black Thought]\nYo, talk about paying the ultimate price\nHurricane been incarcerated all of his life\nStarted out at like twelve\nTrapped in a belly of hell\nGrew into a man inside of a cell\nYo, anger just swell up\nAt a early age that develop\nHot head and now it ain't shit y'all could tell him\nThey said he's on a road to become a felon\nBut instead he swung blows that'll spilt your melon\nHe did his thing and was the king of the ring, undisputed\nStarted making noise but they tried to mute it\nThey put him through it\nFor him to make the system look stupid, [yo]\nThey rather look you in the face and shoot it\nAnd leave your spot looted [or what]\nOr leave your whole life blank futured and caught\nWhen you scream at it and do it\nWith sweat leaking from the outline of your soluid\nDon't understand the point that you at\nOr how the hell you came to it?\nFlashback to images of that night, out in Patterson\nThey pulled him over heading home from a gathering\nAnd when they told him the charge it kind of baffled him\nMurder in the first for the champ, we on that again?\n\n[Chorus: Jazzyfatnastees & Black Thought]\nHurricane\nAccuse a Hurricane\nAin't change a damned shame\nIt's life for Hurricane, Hurricane\nForever, imagine your locked down forever\nCould y'all stand the weather?\nCould you hold it together?\nYou tell me that you know the pain\nYo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane\nForever, imagine your locked down forever\nCould ya'll stand the weather?\nYou built for that weather?\nYo, know what'm saying?\nKnow what'm saying?\n\n[Interlude: Common]\nYou gotta fight for what you believe in\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nNobody knows the troubles seen\nThis flick left me wondering\n\u201cWhat can become of kings and young kids?\u201d\nSummer dream deferred, incident occured, freedom blurred\nA freedom that would only be retrieved again in words, later on\nThe cops, y'all know what they be on\nA nigga's life is like a field that they play upon, away and gone from\nNatural lifer, a soul he had to fight\nLearn it himself, sleep days, stay up half the night\nAmongst dead man walking, he got afterlife exercising\nDeveloping his knack to write\nNever leaving his cell, in this world he trapped himself\nWhat he loved on the outside world, detached himself\nYou know the cards Blacks get dealt by the system\nHe drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions\nThis picture proved to be bigger than Black and White\nA young soul named Lesra brought him back to life\nIt's amazing to a man what a book could do\nAnd how certain books seem to look for you\nThis is the story of a champion's fall and rise\nThe story left me wiping my eyes\nPeace Ru\n\n[Chorus: Jazzyfatnastees & Black Thought]\nHurricane\nAccuse a Hurricane\nAin't change a damned shame\nIt's life for Hurricane, Hurricane\nForever, imagine your locked down forever\nCould y'all stand the weather?\nCould you hold it together?\nYou tell me that you know the pain\nYo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane\nForever, imagine your locked down forever\nCould ya'll stand the weather?\nYou built for that weather?\nYo, know what'm saying?\nKnow what'm saying?\n\n[Verse 3: Mos Def]\nYes, I am the inescapable, the irresistable\nThe unnegotiable, the unchallenged [who dat?]\nI am time\nI scroll in measurements, control the elements\nI hold the evidence, I tell the story [say what?]\nI am time\nI know no prejudice, I bare no sentiments\nFor wealth or settlement, I move forward [who you?]\nI am time\nYou can't recover me, conceal or smuggle me\nRetreat or run from me, crawl up or under me\nYou can't do much for me besides serve\nMe well and have good dividends returned to you\nOr attempt to kill me off and have me murder you\nMany have wasted me but now they are facing me\nTreated me unfaithfully and now endure me painfully\nPlaintively, I wait to see what history will shape to be\nWho's hearts will never die inside the sake of me\nAngel's scribe the page for me\nKeep a full account of all the names for me\nAnd make a special mark for Hurricane who (?) patiently\n\n[Chorus: Jazzyfatnastees & Black Thought]\nHurricane\nAccuse a Hurricane\nAin't change a damned shame\nIt's life for Hurricane, Hurricane\nForever, imagine your locked down forever\nCould y'all stand the weather?\nCould you hold it together?\nYou tell me that you know the pain\nYo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane\nForever, imagine your locked down forever\nCould ya'll stand the weather?\nYou built for that weather?\nYo, know what'm saying?\nKnow what'm saying?\n\n[Verse 4: Dice Raw]\nThe clouds clashed and the heaven's gave birth to star\nGod placed it in a man on the day he was born\nConvicted minutes after, a true natural disaster\nFramed for manslaughter, the Hurricane Carter rising\nFrom out the south water, like torrential rains\nIn the ring no opponent escaped unscathed\nYou can't believe the world we live in's injust\nAll I see is more proof, there's no place for us\nThey had my man Carter locked in a cage, like an animal\nDrive him to the point where the mind work mechanical\nOr works by remote control\nIt was done to all of us, they tapped directly into our soul\nEither it's sing-sing, or it's bars around your mind\nThere's no where to run, no where to hide\nIn a six-by-six a guilty man cries\nFor repentance and lost is what innocence is\n\n[Bridge: Flo Brown]\nSame story, same target, different time\nCyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind\nTrying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind\nWaiting for redemption, surviving in a bind\nSame story, same target, different time\nCyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind\nTrying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind\nWaiting for redemption, surviving in a bind\n\n[Chorus: Jazzyfatnastees & Black Thought]\nHurricane\nAccuse a Hurricane\nAin't change a damned shame\nIt's life for Hurricane, Hurricane\nForever, imagine your locked down forever\nCould y'all stand the weather?\nCould you hold it together?\nYou tell me that you know the pain\nYo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane\nForever, imagine your locked down forever\nCould ya'll stand the weather?\nYou built for that weather?\nYo, know what'm saying?\nKnow what'm saying?\n\n[Outro: Flo Brown]\nSame story, same target, different time\nCyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind\nTrying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind\nWaiting for redemption, surviving in a bind\nSame story, same target, different time\nCyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind\nTrying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind\nWaiting for redemption, surviving in a bind"}], "artist": "Black Thought"}
