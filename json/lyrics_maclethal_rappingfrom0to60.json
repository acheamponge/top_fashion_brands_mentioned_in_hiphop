Buck! And shoot\nFuck with me I swear I'm giving a 21 gun salute\nComing through with the .22\n#23--I'm the Jumpman\nFor 24 hours I've been drunk, man\n25 cents used to get you a phone call\nRan 26 miles and I kicked through a stone wall\nDidn't join the 27 Club\nBut I rode 28 inch rims, and of course, it was fun\nTakes Saturn 29 years to orbit the Sun\nWant beef? Imma put a fucking fork in it: done\nI'm so lyrical\nI'm the baddest motherfucker on the planet\nEverybody just can't stand it\nWhen you listen to me you'll cry real tears\nThat was 30 syllables\n31 flavors\nFranklin D. Roosevelt was the 32nd President\nI'm not the President\nI'm the king\nBut they killed me at age 33 to prove that I was heaven-sent\nNo miracles on 34th Street\nI took 35 mm film to the 36th Chamber\nBumping Wu-Tang, pissing off my neighbors\nThey built a 37 foot wall in Mexico\n39 bullets in my .38 Special, bro\nWhat you got on my 40, homie?\n41 cents? I'll be robbing him\n42. Robinson, Jackie\nRichard Petty, #43\nI got the power of a .44 Maggie\nSpent 45 minutes singing Psalm 46\nBut the 47th Ronin came and tried to slash me\nFor homicide detectives, the clock starts ticking the moment that they're called\nThe chances of solving a murder are cut in half if they don't get a lead within the first 48 hours\nFuck you to the 49th power\nI was listening to 50 Cent out in Area 51 cruising in a pick-up\nWho wants to play a game of 52 card pick up?\n53 players on the field\nStudio 54\nI ain't staying very still\n55 I'll make you Juniors say, \"ow!\"\n56 curls in Shirley Temple's hair, say, \"wow!\"\nIn a '57 Chevy\nWith a 58-year-old with 59 gallons of whiskey\nMy therapist said that when I'm angry, all I gotta do is close my eyes and count to 60\nMy therapist said that when I'm angry, all I gotta do is close my eyes and count to 60\nMy therapist said that when I'm angry, all I gotta do is close my eyes and count to 60\n\n[Outro]\nMan I like fucked up at the end\nHow am I gonna fuck up at the very end?\nI'm just keeping this shit\nHave a good week, y'all", "year": "2017-02-16", "album": "YouTube", "title": "Rapping From 0 to 60"}], "artist": "Mac Lethal"}
