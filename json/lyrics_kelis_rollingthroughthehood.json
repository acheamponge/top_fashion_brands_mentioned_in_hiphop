Maybe tomorrow\nMaybe tomorrow... Maybe tomorrow\nMaybe tomorrow... Maybe tomorrow\nMaybe tomorrow... Maybe tomorrow\n\nBeautiful baby, don't you know you mean the world to me\nThe moon would lose the sky if you don't stay\nDid I ever tell you that you were my sunshine?\nSo basically if you leave, there is no day\n\nYesterday, I rolled through the hood\nAnd I seen somethin'\nAnd it hurt me\nYesterday, I rolled through the hood\nAnd I seen somethin'\nAnd it hurt me\nInstead of scorin' high in college\nWe're scorin' high in garbage\nAnd not rememberin' who we are\nAnd not to mention... forgettin' who God is\nDon't know that you're special\nAnd God will never forget you\nThe world is used, watch what you do with it\n\nBaby I want you to know\nThe suburbs to the ghetto\nJoy is joy and pain is pain, pain\nOne day sooner than you'll know\nWe'll be livin' tomorrow\nAnd we'll be laughin' about today, today\n\nMaybe tomorrow... Maybe tomorrow\nMaybe tomorrow... Maybe tomorrow\nMaybe tomorrow... Maybe tomorrow\nMaybe tomorrow... Maybe tomorrow"}], "artist": "Kelis"}
