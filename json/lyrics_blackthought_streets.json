Organize the stadium\nTell 'em, \"Take cover, I warned you not to play wit' 'em\"\nThem borderline war crimes, you got away wit' 'em\nWho came to save the day and brought the K wit' 'em?\nTariq the people's champ from the equal team\nTryna keep it clean 'long as all my people solid deen\nI've been in the music scene long as Allen Leeds\nMake they salaries, still accumulatin' calories\nDemonstratin' how to breathe, Senegalese, Genovese\nI been a reason to freeze, reek G's in the league\nOn my own, gettin' cheese\nI will hurt Hercules, I will merc most MCs\nI'm the last one to show up, the first one to leave the crime scene\nThe obscene, Salam theme, the ridiculous rhyme scheme\nThe stick to the grind gene, the hell with the hygiene\nIt's a dirty bomb, word to seven thirty time\nDisaster level nine eleven meets the eleven nine\nCatastrophe beyond incredible, I redefine the seventh sign\nFaster, scarier, mass hysteria from Damascus, Syria\nTo middle America, school cafeterias and cul-de-sacs\nI told you that the boss is back, know what I'm sayin'?\n\n[Chorus: Tish Hyman]\nIn these streets that I call home\nUnless you're blind, you'll see it all\nIn these streets it's cold at night\nSirens screamin' by, gunshots all the time\n\n[Verse 2: Black Thought]\nYo, omert\u00e0 code meets the Hippocratic oath\nObservin' his whole circus from a diplomatic post\nMy word and his whole purpose, a cinematic scope\nThe Earth and its whole surface, I consider that his toast\nSame as Sammy Davis, Bellafonte, Quincy Jones\nMahatma Gandhi, James Balwdin, Jesse Owens\nRunnin' from a cop car, me and Akbar\nI changed from a rock boy to a rock star\nHijack the elevator to the top floor\nI'm takin' everything that's left like a southpaw\nCrash and burn and learn through osmosis\nAnd watch the word spread like Tuberculosis\nI took a snapshot but it hurt to post it\nI had a Black Thought and they called it wokeness\nOverdoses, water bugs and roaches\nForty Cals and holsters, all halal and kosher\nTwenty thousand jokers, one ain't playin'\nI'm Claude Brown, Man-child in the Promised Land\n\n[Chorus: Tish Hyman]\nIn these streets that I call home\nUnless you're blind, you'll see it all\nIn these streets it's cold at night\nSirens screamin' by, gunshots all the time"}], "artist": "Black Thought"}
