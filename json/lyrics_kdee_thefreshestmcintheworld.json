Cause that's who I got to be\nIt wouldn't make sense\nTo represent without confidence\n\nAnd got more from where that came from\nIt's a shame some don't know\nSo that leaves more\n\nRoom for me\nSoon to be\nThe talk of your town\nUnderground\nAnd love it by the pound\n\nSo raise your hand if you're sure\nOr get in where you fit in\nThey all want to sit in\nOn this, cause this is where it's at\nIn fact\nI got to be free\nI got to be me\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm world wide, well known\nFor wheeling\nAnd dealing\nFrom the US, I stray up to New Zealand\n\nI must confess, the best is yet to come\nSome try to doubt, but now I'm out and set to run\nGame like Emmitt Smith\nTo the limit\nWith funky ass hits to keep you rolling more spliffs\n\nI can't be kept down\nMaking niggers step down\nRecognize\nEyes open wide as I move inside\nThe center\nBeen into the game since 84 Live\nNow no more nine to five\n\nI'm too much for the average, can't be touched\nWith a ten-foot pole, and with more Soul\nThan De La\nMay I continue?\nSend you\nOn a trip with K to the Dee\nSee\nHow sweet\nThis beat it is on\nThe smooth T. I. P\n\n[Hook X 2]"}], "artist": "K-Dee"}
