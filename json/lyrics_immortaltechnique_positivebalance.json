Look out)\nAnd then I'm positive at Showtime\nI make negative MC's switch styles in no time\nThey change teams, rhyme about kings and queens\nInstead of how they sellin' work to fiends\nThen I switch thugs into soldiers\nThose that have given up on God to praise J Hova (Damn!)\nThe rap Ice Age is over\nAnd positivity protects the Z boulder boulder\n\n[Interlude: Immortal Technique]\nYeah, you know how it goes\nPositivity, yeah\n\n[Hook: Immortal Technique & Big Zoo]\nMy opinion is solid ground but you're a common hater\nSplittin' and dividin' on numbers like a denominator\nThird-eye navigator movements are necessary\nEverything you see in videos is secondary\nYou need positivity like you need respect in jail\nBecause without balance you'll be makin' negative record sales\nNeg-neg-negative record sales\nZiga-zam, Technique, like this\n\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nI jerk off inside books and give life to words\nLeavin' concepts stuck together you probably never heard\nI love when people think I'm psychologically disturbed\n'Cause it means I overloaded their neurological nerves\nRappers try to serve me with disgusting incompetence\nBut I keep it positive with ultimate dominance\nMeditatin' with Native Americans close to Providence\nI speak to the spirits of ancestors at pow-wows\nBut rumor has it that you gettin' raped like Lil' Bow Wow\nNow listen, industry motherfuckers, don't get offended\nRemember that I'll bring an end to your pretender agenda\nAnd render contenders dismembered\nBend the fabric of time and put your soul in a blender\nYou livin' a lie like thinkin' Jesus was born in December\nInstead of caterin' to labels, somethin' gotta give\nI'll rip the electrons out your body and make you positive\nI seen a lot of kids come and go with marketing gimmicks\nBecause without balance, you don't last more than a minute\nThis ain't a game, I'll beat the shit out you at the line of scrimmage\nI rock shows in the ghetto, nigga, you stuck in the village\nI wanted to spit on the radio since I was eleven\nBut I can't afford the pay-ola for Hot 97\nSo I make paper underground, and I'm soon to blow\nMovin' tapes like Biggie's ghost at Bad Boy studios\n*Biggie \u2013 \"Hypnotize\" sample*\n\n[Hook: Immortal Technique & Big Zoo]\nMy opinion is solid ground but you're a common hater\nSplittin' and dividin' on numbers like a denominator\nThird-eye navigator movements are necessary\nEverything you see in videos is secondary\nYou need positivity like you need respect in jail\nBecause without balance you'll be makin' negative record sales\nNeg-neg-negative record sales\nZiga-zam, Technique, like this", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9c9631e16897ed9bc090afd0a05da5ae.1000x974x1.jpg", "album": "Revolutionary Vol. 1", "year": "2001-09-18"}]}
