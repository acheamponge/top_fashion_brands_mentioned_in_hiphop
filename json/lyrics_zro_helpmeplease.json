Straight up\nThis is the sea of life, and I'm drownin\nI know I can swim, but feel like I keep sinkin down in\nThese waters and I cain't breathe, I feel like I'm gon' blow it\nI can see people holdin a life jacket but they won't throw it\nEntertained by my struggle and they'd love to see me die\nWhy not love to see me live instead of helpin my family cry?\nLike a homeless person with a sign, I would work for food\nAin't no shame in bein helpless it's a part of payin dues\nOn an everyday mission tryin to collect 5's and 10's\nSo many worries I promise my bones show right through my skin\nFancy cars and a mansion? That ain't never been my goal\nA hooptie would be fine, plus somewhere warm when it's cold\nI know what it feel like, not to be able to call the shots\nHave a pen but no time to connect, all the dots\nTherefore I do what I can do and then get down on my knees\nCause I can't make it by my lonely, Jesus help a nigga please\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Z-Ro]\nYeah, much love to everybody doin time\nUp in Pam Lychner state jail, you dig\nSeem like soon as I'm findin happiness the joy's gone\nKickin it with Steve Francis, Mike Tyson and Roy Jones\nI waited my whole life to be somebody\nBut now I've gotta get a visit just to see somebody\nI'm in this all white, reminscin all night, but my cousin Trae's\nWreakin havoc in this rap game, so it's alright\nGrandmother and my Auntie gettin everything they need\nTrae's an angel in my eyesight, a true friend in need\nWhile I'm waitin for heaven, I see hell and smell the flames\nGod send Abraham to quickly snatch me from this pain\nI don't really wanna die, just need a, change of scenery\nI done see too many killings just like my vision is mean to me\nAnd my eyes don't like me, and my soul wanna leave\nI'm persecuted daily by my friends it ain't easy\nI do what I can do and then get down on my knees\nI have so many enemies, Lord would you help me please\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Z-Ro]\nNigga fuck Precinct 5, nigga and fuck Officer Thorntonberry\nPunk-ass bitches, uhh\nTryin to survive for me, is like chasin the wind\nYou know you ain't never gon' catch it so why bother lettin yo' knees bend\nI try to stay around some realness, brothers and sisters holla if you feel this\nIf hurt and misery is who you chill with\nMo City my hood it forever be my block\nNever thought I'd see the day it'd hand me over to the cops\nWhere the love from my homeboys, I love y'all too\nI was the tugboat to ya problems cause I drug y'all through\nJust one question dawg, how could you do me like that? I took your family in\nI put some cash in ya pocket, made you a man again\nBut now it's like you never knew me\nWouldn't take the fall for yall so now yall wanna do me\nI made it up out the hood and I ain't comin back\nUnless I'm brangin Lil' Boss to get a hundred sack\nNigga I'm gon' do what I'm gon' do and then get down on my knees\nAnd make a couple of G's, but in God name, help a nigga to succeed", "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/edace8572541436d07b681483f804163.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
