You...\n\n[Chorus]\nCause every time I'm around you\nYou be acting different you ain't acting like yourself\nHere's a bullet for your pride babe\nHere\u2019s a bullet for you, pull the trigger\nCause every time I'm around you\nYou just got some bad news for me babe\nHere's a bullet for your pride babe\nHere\u2019s a bullet for you, pull the trigger\n\n[Verse 2]\nTo you I'm just a struggle rapper\nGo for low blows, then you suck me after\nI hear the chatter and the sudden laughter\nNow who's fast-forward? I don't hustle backwards\nI got you humming to my songs, yeah\nGirl you used to cut me off, yeah\nNow I got it like I said I would\nAnd you ain't saying nothing, like I said you would\n'Bout to set the wood on fire\nBitch I wish you would, call mine yeah\nOff brand niggas tryna cuff you\nPillow talking to yourself, I don't judge you\nUsed to never say you proud of me\nIt's awkward that you doubted me\nI just copped the whip and a house for me\nFuck approval, I'mma vouch for me\n\n[Chorus]\nCause every time I'm around you\nYou be acting different you ain't acting like yourself\nHere's a bullet for your pride babe\nHere\u2019s a bullet for you, pull the trigger\nCause every time I'm around you\nYou just got some bad news for me babe\nHere's a bullet for your pride babe\nHere\u2019s a bullet for you, pull the trigger"}]}
