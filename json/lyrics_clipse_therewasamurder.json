OK?\nThese niggas die out here for snitching, they dying for snitching... OK?\n\n[Verse 1: Pusha T]\nThose who break the code, we dig them holes\nWhat's worse than a street nigga that sells his soul?\nBe it the life we chose, we pick our roles\nBad man stands an' fall but never fold\nGangster\ufeff turn informer when the jig's up\nYa tool mix-up mix-up\nBabylon boys, get bodies left for pick-up\nBlood puddle, gun muffle, guns couple\nMuzzle\ufeff in mouth, we bring trouble\nSoon police come rush, whole family crushed\nAll because them pussies couldn't hush\nShot box mouths with no covers\nBody 'pon body gets stacked, one top th'other\nWish them hadn't to suffer\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Malice]\nNobody seen nothing, heard nothing, they ain't said a word\nJust chalk and yellow tape, with blood 'pon them shirts\nAshes to ashes his body back to the Earth\nThat casket drop six feet, then throw upon it dirt\n\"Mum's the word\", that's hustler's etiquette\nYou'd rather hang yourself than turn state evidence\nEver since I\ufeff was young, never talk to the folk\nTongue small like a rudder, yet steer the 'ole boat!\nLoose lip the reason that ship no longer float\nTelling the Feds everyting they wanna know\nThat fatal blow took his very last breath\nThe power of ya tongue is life-and-death, ya feel me?\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Clipse"}
