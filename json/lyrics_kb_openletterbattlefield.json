(this is a lie)\nThat's why I'm comin' to you prayin'\nI'm prayin' that you can pray for your sister to make it through\nI'm cryin' as I write cause I wanna be right\nMany girls have fallen and I don't wanna fall too\n\n[Chorus: KB & Jai]\nThere's a war inside my heart and mind, every day I fight it\nSo make me align to the truth and rely on your Spirit inside me\n(It's time to make) war, war, war, war, war, war, 'cause life is a battlefield\nWar, war, war, war, war, war, 'cause life is a battlefield\n\n[Verse 2: Swoope]\nDear KB, we're big fans of yours, me and my lady\nWhen you came to the show we was in the front row\nScreamin' One-One-Six, goin' crazy all for the HGA\nWas a crazy night, what's even crazier\nIs the girl I was datin' then is fiance now, I'm engaged to her\nThe words that you left man rocked us\nSo I went and got her left hand rocked up\nBut if I could be honest, I'm tryin' hard to abstain and not get her knocked up\nOf course I want kids, but even more than that I wanna please the Father\nBut when I look into her eyes I can't concentrate\nMan I can't even lie, I wanna consummate\nShe's the one I'm sure but I wanna stay pure\nScary the way that I'm yearnin' for her\nGettin' married but I'm burnin' for her\nHard for me to wait 'til she walk in that aisle down\nIn her white gown, I'm thinkin' night gown\nMan I wanna do it right now\nWhy wait when I feel like she my wife now?\nThe way that I'm feeling is natural but KB is it godly?\nIs it wrong lust or strong love, this feeling inside for wifey?\nHonored the Lord in datin' her, wanna do the same in waitin' but\nThis temptation's a beast, please pray for us\n\n[Chorus: KB & Jai]\nThere's a war inside my heart and mind, every day I fight it\nSo make me align to the truth and rely on your Spirit inside me\n(It's time to make) war, war, war, war, war, war, 'cause life is a battlefield\nWar, war, war, war, war, war, 'cause life is a battlefield\n\n[Verse 3: Trip Lee]\nDear God, we come in His name\nThe slain and risen who's runnin' this thing\nChrist the Lord, the one who can bring\nHealin' the hurts of the ones that He claims\nWe think we got nothin' to gain\nBy clingin' to Christ, the love of the King\nBut He was under the same\nTemptin' and hurt, He's accustomed to pain\nKnow they feel it, feel it\nPain but they joy can kill it, kill it\nFeelin' like life been pillaged\nCan I please intercede for a minute\nThis is not out of Your grasp\nYour grace can shake, Your power can smash\nI pray this hour and ask\nAllow them to see Your power surpass\nThat said, devour they past\nDrown them with mercy, shower them fast\nGive 'em the faith to follow the Father\nHe's Abba, Your Honor, please swallow the trash\nDear Lord, you were never gone\nYou promised You'd make 'em forever strong\nYour arm isn't short, it is very long\nMake 'em like Christ, You get 'em home\n\n[Chorus: KB & Jai]\nThere's a war inside my heart and mind, every day I fight it\nSo make me align to the truth and rely on your Spirit inside me\n(It's time to make) war, war, war, war, war, war, 'cause life is a battlefield\nWar, war, war, war, war, war, 'cause life is a battlefield"}], "artist": "KB"}
