Like whatchamacallit\nI see the sea just parted\nAnd Air Vast just called it\nMan, you ain't half as tight\nI can bend any substance, that's metal nightlight\nI can break any rule that's slavery type\nI'm awful, we take no shit, that's the form we like\nAdam's fam\nYou wanna fight styles, we got t-shirts that say we cut hands\nSon we'll take both of 'em, the first time\nSo you can't play even play the wind chime\nOr the piano, jazz or classical\nI'm Vast Aire I might rip out your clavicle\nPsh, then it's over\nIt's like that, I'm in the air, with Jehovah\nOr in a, Range Rover\nOr maybe in the sky holding onto the tail of a star nova\nCrazy?
