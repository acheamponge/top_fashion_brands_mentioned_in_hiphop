Even she knows when the goodbyes and hellos is tart\nTime don't heal every wound sometimes it adds to the sufferage\nI'm knowing as if life wasn't enough a bitch\nYour presence is missing; still I know your spiritual essence will listen\nGive your brother my blessings in prison\n\n[Hook 2X]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey say suicides an unforgivable act\nCan't sneak into God's graces there's no visible cracks\nSo when it's time for him to revisit the facts, I'm praying\nThat you an exception to the rule and he'll review every individuals tracks\nLord I hope you see the goodness that was\nBut keep a spot in your heart for him and the heavenly hood that's above\nI understood it's a shove to ask you to keep his soul in your graces\nBut if anything could it's the love\nIf I could turn back the hands of time I'd rather squeeze the tool myself\nCan't let that kind of fate repeat G\nI hate me deeply, the possibility if I was to die this moment\nYou wouldn't be at the golden gates to greet me\nThe absence would mess up the vanity the rest of infinity\nIf I had a personal hell, you could guess what's the penalty\nShit, just the main thought of it all makes me teary eyed\nNo matter how much I tell myself to look on the cheery side\nNo matter how much I talk with God in deep discussion\nCause you and I both knew the repercussions\nWhen you put your soul in the reapers clutches\nSo why then, I'm still trying to figure as I'm crying this river\n\n[Hook 2X]", "album": "The Darkest Cloud", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f0fa8d572f04773a721576175bcefb21.488x500x1.jpg"}]}
