Everyday trying to get a better understanding of myself and this crazy game I have given my life to\nWhat I\u2019ve come to grips with is the fact that I am not superhuman, BUT super human.  I think our culture has made it almost a prerequisite to be \u201ctoo cool\u201d or \u201cswagged out\u201d carrying a \u201cnothing can phase me\u201d image. It\u2019s to the point that the ones who show they care, get attacked the most. Who ever thought we\u2019d see a day when somebody used the word \u201cpoetic\u201d as an insult? I certainly never thought that.  \u201cI can\u2019t fuck wit Wale \u2018ol poetic ass.\u201d Really? These are the same people who probably have every Pac album embedded in their head. But, I digress. I took an absence from Twitter because I started to care tooooo much. I still don\u2019t know the root of what makes me care THAT much, but I\u2019m quite sure it started by wanting to lead people in a direction that wasn\u2019t as clich\u00e9 as some of my peers\nI\u2019m no saint. I fuck with ratchet bitches. I say bitch. I bitch about things my damn self. But, I can honestly say, that I try to use my \u201chuman\u201d traits as a means of relating to other humans.  If I can bare my insecurities and flaws before you, maybe you won\u2019t feel so insecure and flawed\nThere came a point where people went out of their way to remind me that I\u2019m missin my mark. Albeit, I made myself a target to slander and criticism. I think it became a trend to fuck with anybody that cared about people\u2019s opinion. I\u2019m not one of those people who make music for material things. I strive to make music for a public that appreciates raw emotion. And I will continue to\nI went through stages of frustration in my career with publications because of my own selfishness and sense of entitlement. I admit that. Nevertheless, I think if we calling a spade a spade, some media outlets be on they bullshit with me for reasons outside of music. But, my goal moving forward is to focus less on THEM and more on US.  We all have goals and mine is simple. Empower the people. Empower MY fans and focus on MY fans and their energy . I don\u2019t think it\u2019s humanly possible for me to appease some of these outlets no matter what I create. It burns my soul to hear there\u2019s no message tho. So knowin that I may have fell short of connecting with some of them,  I\u2019ve decided to use my energy on US. The guy with all the mixtapes. The guy who listens to every song twice because they know there\u2019s things hidden in there. The girl who can\u2019t wait to hear \u201cAmbitious Girl 3\u201d (Oh, it\u2019s coming). The girl with the \u201cAmbition\u201d tattoo, who gets dressed to \u201cIllest Bitch Alive\u201d every morning . The ones who understood my frustration, hated my rant but understood it nevertheless . I may never be the biggest rapper in the world (still one of the best doe) but, I\u2019ll be the most dedicated to my fans and it starts with this right here. This is rare. This is REAL. This is about us. This is about the music again. My ReRE -Dedication to greatness. What we got doesn\u2019t happen often, nor with too many people. This is an rare occasion when a rare bond\u2026 Happens\nEverybluemoon\n-Folarin", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/e0cde0eabe61c1ddca97cce2386792d2.421x421x1.jpg"}]}
