Stack Bundles\nSee me play now they calling for a huddle\nI don't fight I don't get into a tussle\nI don't ever gotta flex no muscle\nAdrenaline running around my tracks\nNo don't tell Bones to relax\nMy feet up reclining rewinding to the day that we scrapped that cab\n3 A.M, snow on the grass\n3:06, we made them tracks\nDon't know how we made it back its a fact that all I know's a regretful past\n\n[Hook]\nFrostbite, cover my hands up to my face I don't feel a thing\nFrostbite, cover my hands up to my face I don't feel a thing\nWait!\nSitting in the back seat, where we going?\nI can't recognize one face anymore\nI don't know no one everything foreign\nFuck it all somebody help me out", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4e48376f34b2781dd442820f41c995b9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}]}
