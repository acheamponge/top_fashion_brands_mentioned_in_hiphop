Pettite on it\nA noble's face and I'm doing my pace\nMakin' sure all my conrads get a true taste\nWhat?.. a good shit and I'm ringing your memory\nWe goin' hard yo and that's how it need to be\nSo wake up and take that sleep outcha eyes my friend\nHere's the mot-to in your ear hear this again\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Outro:]\nHeavy hitters knockin shit out the park\nYou didn't even really play tell me why did you start"}], "artist": "Q-Tip"}
