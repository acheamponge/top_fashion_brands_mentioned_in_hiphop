If I think it, I write a song\nTo scared for mental checkups cause they tell me that my mind is gone\n\n[Hook: John Andrews]\nStuck inside myself again\nCovered up in the bruises from my youth\nAnd I don\u2019t wanna face the fact\nThat I\u2019m off track and won\u2019t make it back\nSay it\u2019s never safe to crash\nBut don\u2019t be sad when it fades to black\n\n[Verse 2: Kerser]\nWaking up a zombie you\u2019re to kind to blame it on me\nAin\u2019t my fault that I am not be one to turn it down, get off me\nI don\u2019t need a bunch of parents blaming me cos their kids are swearing\nLike they never hear the shit at school but blaming me\u2019s the answer\nI\u2019m the cancer if you asking, but wait let\u2019s stop and just ask the kids\nCause I be saving lives and they decide to look right past all this\nHundred emails weekly, here\u2019s one that will never leave me\nSingle mother writes to management it\u2019s desperate that she meets me\nCause the son he had a habit from when he was age of 14\nIn and out of rehab but my music\u2019s only thing that taught him\nThat there\u2019s other ways around it, so he left the rehab clean and all\nKerser through the earphones, got a job, he even sweepin floors\nOne night he is out with mates he copped a sucker punch and died and she just wants to thank me cause I gave him 4 more years of life\nCrazy cause I\u2019m messed up in my own head, yeah you so surprised\nPoppin what I can cause I can\u2019t handle this, I\u2019m going [?]\n\n[Hook: John Andrews]\nStuck inside myself again\nCovered up in the bruises from my youth\nAnd I don\u2019t wanna face the fact\nThat I\u2019m off track and won\u2019t make it back\nSay it\u2019s never safe to crash\nBut don\u2019t be sad when it fades to black\n\n[Verse 3: Kerser]\nOk I make a U-turn yeah, it\u2019s time to pull my head in\nAnd hope to jump in bead and get earphones and just forget it\nForget about the drama, life\u2019s to short just fix it upper\nWhen you get home, you know nudda\nYou can handle this your brothers\nWait along onside a road and I ain\u2019t got my lights on neither\nNeed my window wipers on cause I can barely see the mirror\nAlmost home I guess this place is really where I get away\nBut before I leave I just got one more thing I wanna say\n\n[Hook: John Andrews]\nStuck inside myself again\nCovered up in the bruises from my youth\nAnd I don\u2019t wanna face the fact\nThat I\u2019m off track and won\u2019t make it back\nSay it\u2019s never safe to crash\nBut don\u2019t be sad when it fades to black"}], "artist": "Kerser"}
