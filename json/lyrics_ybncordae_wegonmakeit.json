I said, \"Hell yeah\"\nI'm ready, when I put the crown on, it was heavy\nI was drownin' in my past like when Katrina broke the levees in New Orleans\nIn my city, to them kids, I'm like Jordan\nEvery move I make like chess, it's important\nI just went against the system, spending nights tryna reform it\nLay at night thinkin' I could lose my life just from doin' this\nIt's a sacrifice, I know it wouldn't be right if I forfeit\nBut I do it for the young kings that never had no voices, for real\n\n[Chorus: Meek Mill]\nI could've died on that pavement\nEvery time I see my mom, I be like, \"Wait a minute'\"\nShe know it's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit\nAnd I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it\nShit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?\nSuccess is in my arm reach and I can taste it\nIn the mansion, I was just down in the basement\nThey didn't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it\n\n[Verse 3: YBN Cordae]\nYeah, okay, I reminisce the cold days in wintertime, got home by dinner time\n7-Eleven runs, Gatorade flavor lemon-lime\nHot Cheetos, Arizonas, oranges, clementine\nThe first job I ever applied for was Finish Line\nSometimes a nigga be forgettin', then remember I'm\nSavior of the rap shit, the leader of the renaissance\nSelf-appointed, well anointed for my endeavors\nI'm eyein' cheddar, applyin' pressure, defyin' set-ups\nThe rap game is based upon what niggas lyin' better\nIf truth is told, then you can grow and dyin' never\nNo, I'm everlastin', better graspin' this thing in life\nI heard Meek hook and I told him to sing it twice, my God\n\n[Chorus: Meek Mill]\nI could've died on that pavement\nEvery time I see my mom, I be like, \"Wait a minute'\"\nShe know it's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit\nAnd I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it\nShit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?\nSuccess is in my arm reach and I can taste it\nIn the mansion, I was just down in the basement\nThey didn't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it", "title": "We Gon Make It"}]}
