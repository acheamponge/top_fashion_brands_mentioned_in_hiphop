This is a message from the battlefront, from your trusted knight, Sir Daniel Sexbang\n\n[Verse 1]\nI have ridden thousands of miles\nI have survived the deadliest trials\nI've fought through battles you can't even dream\nFor a taste of your peppermint creams\n\nSword and steed are all that I've had\nTo conquer the evil over the land\nBut the beacon of light at the end of their schemes\nWas the thought of your peppermint creams\n\n[Chorus]\nOH! Talkin' about your boobies\nThe peppermint creams are your boobies\nYour boobalicious boobies\nOH GOD!\nGAH JUST LEMME GET AT THOSE BOOBIES ONE TIME!!!!!!!\n\n[Verse 2]\nLost in the dark of eternal night\nFailing my quest meant the end of my life\nAnd when things were the worst I wanted to scream\nThen I thought of your peppermint creams\n\nNow I kneel and pray to the gods\nAmidst fallen cities and crumbling facades\nThat I shall return and make you my queen\nAnd bask in your peppermint creams\n\n[Chorus]\nALSO YOUR BUTT!\nTHE TERM PEPPERMINT CREAMS ALSO REFERS TO YOUR SWEET BUTT\nOH YOUR ASS CHEEKS FROM HEAVEN\nAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!\nWhich do I like more? Your boobs or your butt?\nGOD ABOVE don't make me choose!\nI'd rather die than choose I'D RATHER FUCKING DIE!!!!!\n\n[Outro]\nAnd with these last words\nI must now bid you adieu\nYou are my princess\nAnd I will always love you...r boobs. It's the boobs. I like the boobs more, I just realized"}], "artist": "Ninja Sex Party"}
