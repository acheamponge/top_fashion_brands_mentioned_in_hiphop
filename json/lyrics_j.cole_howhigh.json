(Yeah)\nI get a lil taste then I\u2019m through with it\nThen I send her right back to you with it (Ha ha), hey, how high?\n(Hey) What's love (How high?)\nGot to do, got to do with it? (How high?)\nI get a lil taste then I\u2019m through with it (How high?)\nYeah, I send her right back to you with it\n\n[Verse 1: J. Cole]\nVisionary, play your position, no missionary\nBut yet I pack Gospel in the quotes I spoke\nYou listening to the most high like the Pope on dope\nNow picture that, my poetry\u2019s deep, now fish for that\nOnly real niggas catch something, phoney niggas fail\nShit you gotta feel like it\u2019s only read in braille\nBoth did the crime but his homie didn\u2019t tell\nSo he fucking bitches while he sitting lonely in a cell\n\"Thinking well, what the hell I been on\nThey gave a nigga five then they threw another ten on\nBy the time I\u2019m back in the streets like a bachelor\nI gotta play the clubs with the old ass women\"\nLife is a movie, pick your own role\nClimb your own ladder or you dig your own hole\nYou sit around crying, that's like sitting round dying\nYou wanna touch the sky? Bitch, you figure out flying\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga, how high? So high that I could touch the sky\nHow sick? So sick that I could fuck yo\u2019 bitch\nNigga please, my squad stack plenty of G\u2019s\nAnd if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees\nHow high? So high that I could touch the sky\nHow sick? So sick that I could fuck yo\u2019 bitch\nNigga please, my squad stack plenty of G\u2019s\nAnd if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees\n\n[Verse 2]\nHey, as the troubles of the world unfurl\nMy niggas hit the trees like squirrels\nTryna get a nut with your girl, think I need to quit tryin'\n\u2018Fore some nigga out there try to hit mine\nKarma for the Kama Sutra\nA lot calmer when the ganja\u2019s through ya\nYou need ya armour cause them niggas out here tryna shoot ya\nKinda crucial, police piranha, gon snatch you out that Honda\nFor stashing that marijuana\nYes, ya honour, I feel ashamed\nI broke the law but look I\u2019ll never smoke or steal again\nIn your courtroom wylin\u2019, I don\u2019t mean to keep smiling\nBut right now I\u2019m high enough to probably steal a plane\nMan, just look at me, what if I couldn\u2019t read?\nWould you throw the book at me\nWhat if I\u2019m feeling sad, am I supposed to look happy\nIt\u2019s been a long time coming\nTell my nigga roll me up something\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga how high? so high that I could touch the sky\nHow sick? so sick that I could fuck yo\u2019 bitch\nNigga please, my squad stack plenty of G\u2019s\nAnd if your girl like to smoke we got plenty of trees\n\n[J. Cole ]\nNo I dont smoke, maybe once in a blue\nWhen the tension gets thick then there\u2019s nothing to do\nThrough the windows of my soul, open the blind\nMy eyes get shut but I open my mind\n\nHow high? la la la la\nHow high? hey hey hey\nHow high? yeah yeah yeah yeah\nHow high? la la la la\n\nIs that a shot that you threw little man?\nI understand, you frustrated career ain't going how you planned\nMake it worse, your friends, now when they talk rap\nAll you hear is \u201cJ Cole this\u201d and \u201cJ Cole that\u201d\nIt must be hard for your pride just to take all that\nI know your weak heart gotta break off that\nBoy, look, Cole World this is your worst fear\nI\u2019m burning you niggas and I\u2019m only in first gear\nI\u2019m serving you niggas this is only the first beer\n12 months from now, you\u2019ll be having the worst year\nNo tears for the haters, I\u2019m still counting money\nCole ain't dropping, thats real fucking funny\nGrade A dummy, sleeping on a nigga raps\nSomething like a mummy\nBut I\u2019mma wake yo\u2019 ass up\nSomething like your mommy on school day\nI smoke two l\u2019s with ya girl this is Cool J\n\nHow high?\nHow high?\nHow high? yeah\nHow high? yeah\n\nWhats love got to do, got to do with it\nI get a little taste then I\u2019m through with it\nYeah I send it right back to you with it"}], "artist": "J.
