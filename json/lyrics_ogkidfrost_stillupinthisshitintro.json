snatch ya\nFrost is still down clown, no me digas nada\nComing with that Brown sound in '90 with La Raza\nEleven years later, seven albums greater\nStill kicking flavor, still love to see my young Latins getting paper\nI ain't no hater, it's West Coast on mine\nBrown Pride, still down with that big Eastside\nMan I gotta send a Q-Vo to my Boricua brother\nBig Pun Rest In Peace, there'll never be another\nJoey Crack who got my back in the Boogiedown Bronx\nY'all know Fat Joe, Cuban Link, and Terror Squad\nI hopped up on a plane, met up with Don Cisco\nI flew from LA, he flew from Frisco\nStomp like Mazdas through fifty states\nRock car shows and concerts, then bounce rock skates\nTo H-Town to get down with the Tejanos\nSPM and all my Hustle Town hermanos\nBaby Beesh my vale clicka camarada\nJay Tee from the V, let me see ya pop your collar\nWe squat Impalas in Pueblo with Beto\nBack to the Springs all over rocky Colorado\nRolex movado, Mexico to Tahoe\nBack to Vegas burning vegas full of palo\n\n[Frost]\nHaha, we in Las Vegas now man\nLet's get high Cisco, man fire that shit up dog\n\n[Don Cisco]\nYo yo, and for these trees we need some Mexicali phillies\nHey yo let me drop, before we get to the hotel man stop at the store\n\n[Frost]\nNow we at the venitian waiting for the chicas to come\nPresidential suit, called up Clika One\nBad Boy, Brown, Romero is my perro\nIn the 702 and the '72 Monte Carlo\nPedal to the metal headed to the Monte Carlo\nThen to the House of Blues cuz that's where all the stars go\nCisco seen a stripper that he knew from Frisco\nSipping liquor and had a thick girlfriend with her\nThat's when he introduced her to my macking\nHi my name is Frost mama, let's get it cracking\nIt's time to go Cisco, bring your friends, let's make it happen\nSix bottles of Cris mixed with pit bull and Latin\nFools when we're rapping just like my homey Lil'\nA Sicko from Diego, a wino off ripple\nI know we shouldn't drink, we got an early flight\nIt's Phoenix tomorrow but it's Vegas tonight\nThe city that never sleeps so you know we didn't\nHungover at the airport at six, I ain't bullshitting\n\n[Frost]\nMan Cisco I ain't gonna make it dog\nI'm hella tired\n\n[Don Cisco]\nWhoo, burned out\nWe ain't got no more trees fool\n\n[Frost]\nWhat?\n\n[Don Cisco]\nWhat we gonna do?\n\n[Frost]\nMan we're flying back to LA today man\n\n[Don Cisco]\nWho we gonna fuck with, Black?\n\n[Frost]\nNah man, Mexico\nYup\n\n[Frost]\nThat's the way to go though, my homey got the dodo\nThe guero with the best yesca straight from Acapulco\nShoot a fool to Phoenix from Nevada, guess we're loco\nBut it's a no no to do a show without the dodo\nWhat I'm supposed to smoke after the show at the mo mo\nYou know my estilo, baby hop into my low low\nIndoor outdoor, came through without\nThe coffee shops in Amsterdam know what I'm about\n\n[waitress]\nWelcome to Amsterdam Frost\nIt's good to see you again\nToday's specials are purple haze mixed with blonde Lebanese\nAnd blueberry mixed with black Afghanistan\n\n[Frost]\nYeah I want that too\n\n[Don Cisco]\nMe gusta\n\n[Don Cisco]\nPlayboy shit, designer weed and Belvedere\nDime piece chicks in G-strings with rabbit ears\nAtmosphere full of smoke, whole crew ranching\nFive star hotels become the Hugh Hef' mansion\nDon Cisco, I love getting lap dances\nBut baby hold on, I got a call from the Hit-A-Lick expansion\n\n*phone rings*\n\n[Don Cisco]\nGet up, get up\nBaby move\nHello?\n\n[Tony G]\nYo\n\n[Don Cisco]\nTon' G what's up\n\n[Tony G]\nWhat up man\nHey where the fuck's Tootie at\n\n[Don Cisco]\nHere's right here hold on\nFrost\n\n[Frost]\nWhat's up dog\n\n[Tony G]\nHey man, what are you doing\nYou gotta get down here at Hit-A-Lick tonight\nFinish this damn album, man what's wrong with you\n\n[Frost]\nDamn man, we up here at Amsterdam dog\nBut man we're gonna get on a plane and do it right now dog\nFor sure\n\n[Tony G]\nMan you better get down here and knock it out\nTonight, tonight\n\n[Frost]\nThe next thing you know we was on a flight\nBack to LA the very same night\nGame tight but LAX lost my luggage\nI'm a boss so I chalked it up and just said fuck it\nMe and Cisco hopped into the Cherokee truck\nOn dubs, stopped by the liquor store and got us some blunts\nAnd then we hit the mall to quickly get fitted\nCalled Tony G, said we'd be there in twenty minutes\nPulled up to the parking lot, the spot was packed\nALT and Nino Brown, they got my back\nSlowpain pulled up in a coke white El Camino\nG-Fellas, Frost and Cisco, West Coast Gambinos\nPablito said that Hit-A-Lick's the place for me\nBeen down with Tony G since '83\nMe, Ruthless and Eazy and like Peter, Paul and Mary\nI been down since '95 when I first signed with Jerry\nHeller, before that I was at Virgin getting cheddar\nThat Was Then, This Is Now, it'll be Frost forever"}]}
