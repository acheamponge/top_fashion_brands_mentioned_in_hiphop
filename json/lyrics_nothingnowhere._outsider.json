But when school's out and the others go off to enjoy themselves, well... If you're what they call a shy guy, that's when you really feel it. The odd loneliness of being new in town. You don't know how to make people like you, and you find yourself holding a grudge against them. You're standing on the outside, looking in. You might have something to contribute to their conversation, but nobody cares whether you do or not. There's a barrier, and you don't know how to begin breaking it down. You imagine they keep watching the way you look, the way you act. They think you're different. So, you head for home. What else? But still, you can't forget that you're alone. An outsider.\""}], "artist": "\u200bnothing,nowhere."}
