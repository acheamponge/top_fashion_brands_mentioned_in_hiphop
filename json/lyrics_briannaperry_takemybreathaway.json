Damn!\nNo bullets left in the gun, in the gun\nGirl down, I'm on the run\nI took a breath away, I took a breath away\n(Take my breath away)\nOh my, what have I done? Oh God!\nNo bullets left in the gun\nGirl down, I'm on the run\nI took a breath away, I took a breath away\n\n[Verse 2]\nDays past couple times we passed by\nWay I'm looking plenty men saying hi\nWay I'm looking boyfriend saying bae\nWay I'm looking fat boys running out\nYou would never notice, though\nHave taught my man and my pet\nHave appointments in the cardio\nWe are 17, man, carryin' in a new bag\nEven put your last name in my hashtag\nI took a picture of myself, I took a picture of ya\nI put 'em two together, lookin' at you as a couple\nWill not be lookin' at you, thinkin' I be seeing double\nDon't want nobody else picking, put you in a bubble\nThey dream about the day you say my name, baby\nThen a thunderstorm came, purple rain, baby\nMy prince, seal these lips in this quick kiss\n[?]\nShe was Therese and I was [?]\nShe was Therese and I was [?]\nHe was blind to my beauty and my booty\n'Cause he had a look cutie [?]\nBlacked out when I came thru\nEverybody lookin' at me, lookin' at me him too\nTears in his eyes, gun in my palm\nNo life in her body, oh my, what have I done?\n\n[Chorus]\n(Take my breath away)\nOh my, what have I done? Damn!\nNo bullets left in the gun, in the gun\nGirl down, I'm on the run\nI took a breath away, I took a breath away\n(Take my breath away)\nOh my, what have I done? Oh God!\nNo bullets left in the gun\nGirl down, I'm on the run\nI took a breath away, I took a breath away", "year": "2013-01-14", "album": null}], "artist": "Brianna Perry"}
