What we gonna say now?\nNow can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now?\nWhere we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow after the sensation, and the empty fornication\nShe brought affection home\nInto her bed, quickly multiplying\nNow the 3 of them are dying by the poison she perceived to be good (head!)\nNow Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment\nCause everything appears to be the same\nThey entertain suggestion\nNext time just use protection\nDesiring to cover up their shame\nBut much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyes\nTo the very antidote to their dilemma\nBurning in their lust\nBoth of them adulterous\nDestroying the original agenda\nPraying to the sky, in order to maintain a lie\nThey exhausted every possible conclusion\nThey can't even entertain the solution\nIn a brain filled with vain information and pollution\nHiding from the truth\nHe provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situation\nWhen confronted, blamed his wife\nGiving birth to carnal life\nRefusing to acknowledge what he done\nNow if we can agree with who created us to be\nWho says we're guilty everyone before his eyes\nMaking no exceptions, since the day of our conception\nPredisposed to hating truth, and loving lies\n\n[Hook]\nNow can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now?\nWhere we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?\nNow can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now?\nWhere we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?\n\n[Verse 3]\nStop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified\nUn-learn everything you know, and let Him teach you\nLine upon line, and precept upon precept, say goodbye\nTo this decaying social system\nHe wants to know how far we're willing to go\nIf we love him like we say we do\nHe will try us\nJust you don't regress\nOr slip into hopelessness\nOnce He's satisfied His love\nHe won't deny us\n\n[Hook - Shift]\nAnd then He'll tell us, what, what we gonna do now?\nWhere we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?\nAnd then He'll tell us, what, what we gonna do now?\nWhere we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
