Nah man, a piece of me\nBut you can't see it that when you be dancing B\nAs I asked you a question that's how you answer me\nSo when you don't dance it be like I'm choking from cancer\nLike I wrote rancid rhymes, I can't survive, sure\nI rationalize, like oh I see\nBut if you don't like my cut it's like you don't like me\nSome stuff works, some works, not so well\nIt's like you work like hell, still get hurt like hell\nYo, it can tear you apart\nBut don't let your wins go to your head, your losses go to your heart\nAnd if we ever get the pleasure to meet\nBe clever wit and please measure what you yell in the street, c'mon\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b6862accc0e70d12f7d4a50c2aee85da.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Lost and Found", "title": "Could U Love Me"}]}
