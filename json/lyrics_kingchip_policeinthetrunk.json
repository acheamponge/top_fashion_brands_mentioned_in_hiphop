You make one move you gonna get killed\nBitch ass nigga what's up? Take off that radio and belt\nHe try to pull a superhero move and grab my shotty\nI just took a step back and blew his melon off his body\nDamn there's so much blood and brains I ain't get none on me\nHad a blanket in the trunk I wrapped him up and hit the street\nSet the police car on fire 'fore I left so yea, I'm good\nFeelin' tell my nigga [?] come up to the hood\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm riding with this headless deputy I got a plan\nGot to drive this headless deputy like halfway 'cross the land\nSo I'm flying up 'bout 90 bumping Project Pat I'm cool\nI got off on Eddie Rd. I knew exactly what to do\nMy nigga father own a butcher shop right [?]\nBout to turn this nigga to ground beef as soon as I get there\nLet my nigga know the scoop I told him raise up the garage\nTold him climb up off them bitches he was having a menage\nLess than 20 minutes I got to the shop and popped the trunk\nCop shitted on himself you should have smelt the way he stunk\nGave my nigga like four rags and told him take care of this here\nWas the same cop that killed two of my niggas late last year\n\n[Hook x2]"}]}
