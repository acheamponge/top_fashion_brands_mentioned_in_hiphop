(Did I let you down again?)\nIf I leave here now, it won't feel right\nWith somebody else in my bed\nAnd I'm breakin' down again (Breakin' down again)\nBut if I need to go just to show you\nI don't fuckin' care if you don't give a shit 'bout me\nAt all, you little bitch, that's cool with me\nSo act like you don't know\nThat I don't fuckin' stare at anybody else\nThe way I do, when it's only me and you\n\n[Chorus: Lil Peep]\nYou know it's me\nYou know it's me\nYou know it's me\nYou know it's me\nYou know it's me\nYou know it's me\nYou know it's me\nYou know it's me\nIt's me\n\n[Outro: Lacey Sturm]\nMy arms are searchin' for you\nMy arms are out stretched towards you\nI feel you on my finger tips\nMy tongue dances behind my lips, for you"}], "artist": "Lil Peep"}
