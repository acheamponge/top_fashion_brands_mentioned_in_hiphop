To be your man? (2X)\n\n..\n\nJust think of the first time that we went out to the movies\nWhen we went to see that picture\nIahhhhhh, I was the on the first thing smokin\nJust to fly that head to getcha (I gotta getcha)\nAnd what about the time that I called you long distance\nOn my car telephone (and I was alone)\nNow that's what I call reachin out to touch somebody\nAt a million dollar zone\nBut you see, it didn't matter sweatheart, nah baby\nCause I'd call Mars for you\nClimb the highest mountain to be by your side\nWord to MOTHER, cause my love is true (my love is true)\nGirl, if you could just understand (try to understand)\nAll the things that I'd do\nJust for the sake of me, Kane, bein your man\n\n*sung* How would it feel? To be your man? (2X)\n\nDo it to em Blue Magic!\n\n*sung* How would it feel? To be your man? (2X)\n\nSo whatchu sayin baby?\nSo whatchu sayin baby?\n\n*sung* How would it feel? To be your man?
