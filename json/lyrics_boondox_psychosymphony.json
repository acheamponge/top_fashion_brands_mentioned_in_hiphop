No longer taking a breath\nAnd when did it all go away? If I started blastin' at bastards\nStartin' killing everybody, I\u2019m a virus or cancer?\nAm I the reason for bleeding the reason families are grieving\nThe reason for seasons like I\u2019m the reason for heathens\nOr am I just a human being who is only being human\nWith more questions and answers like what the hell am I doing?\nWhy do I'm still obsessed with this shit just fill me with zolopine\nLet me drew in the corner, just shoot me up fully dopamine\nI just wanna drift away I call my daily departed\nBut with my love that's how this whole situation got started\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge: Syn]\nThis won't go away until your dying day\nAnd you will suffer in your own way (your own way)\nAnd in the end there will be hell to pay (hell to pay)\nAt the gates they say \"go away, go away, go away...\"\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/181444660a65d0000670a98f7f5af756.400x400x1.jpg"}]}
