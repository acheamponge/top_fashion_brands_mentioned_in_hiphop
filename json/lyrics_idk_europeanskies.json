They say it's warm there\nThey say we all sin, so our people would swarm there\nThere must be a lot of room in Heaven because only a baby is pure\nSo maybe we're born there\nMaybe the division of religion would cause us to be torn there\nEarth is so dirty\nWe come from the dust of the dirt from the Earth\nEarth is so dirty\nWe're told not to love worldly things\nBut we come from the dirt of the Earth and the Earth is so worldly\nAs we fidget spin around the sun\nAnd the night swallows the day, remember that for some, um\n\n[Chorus]\nSun don't shine in the middle of November or December\nDoves don't chirp in the middle of the night\nIf the son of God came in the form of a bird\nIt wouldn't ever fly, European sky\n\n[Outro]\nClose your eyes", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b77211ed800701c5cc8dc9a5a6ec95fa.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Is He Real?", "year": "2019-09-04"}]}
