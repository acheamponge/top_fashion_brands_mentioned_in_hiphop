And you reppin' what gang, nigga?\nHold up, hold up\nHold up, hold up\nWho 'dere? Who 'dere? Can't just let anybody roll up\nHold up, hold up\nWe takin' you 'cause we supposed to\nWhat you said your name was again? Naw, my niggas don't know you\nHold up, hold up\nHold up, hold up\nWho 'dere?

What the business is?\nWho you? Where the plug at?\nWhy talk to a nigga if it ain't 'bout the money, who does that?\nWhy talk to a nigga that I don\u2019t know, he might be the po-po\nOr he might be down with the opp tryna line me up on the low-low\n\n[Chorus: Uncle Murda]\nWhat's good, what's your name, nigga?\nYou affiliated with who? And you reppin' what gang, nigga?\nHold up, hold up\nHold up, hold up\nWho 'dere? Who 'dere?

Who 'dere? Can't just let anybody roll up\n\n[Verse 2: Dave East]\nYou a opp or a fan, nigga?\nI know you watchin' on the 'Gram, nigga\nDon\u2019t lose your life for a band, nigga\nGot the Desert on me, I\u2019m a sand nigga\nCaught him lackin' on the East, man got clipped\nHe was up in [?] with 'em\nAmiri got me rockin' tan denim (eleven hunnid, [?])\nHold up, gotta roll up\nGot some Cali' we can smoke up\nThe homies proud to see the loc up\nDeadass, my paper don\u2019t joke much (deadass)\nThem niggas roll up and you choked up\nThey ask me about, don\u2019t know much\nJealous, I see your shit slowed up\nGold medals, they need to reward us\nI had start with a quarter\nI had to trap for a lawyer\nYou\u2019ll get clapped in the mornin'\nThis track is a actual warnin'\n[?] actually performin'\nThirty K if you wanna perform this\nFifteen just to see my face\nClear them niggas out, I can see my way\nSnoop told me I'm the hardest young nigga out\nHonestly, I needed Dre\nGotta bring it wit' us when we leave the Bay\nDon\u2019t give a fuck what the people say\nKnow we showin' up them people play\nNumbers runnin' up, I just be in Chase\nI told you we be in touch\nSlowed up, I seen his face\n\n[Chorus: Uncle Murda]\nHol' up, hol' up\nWhat's good, what's your name, nigga?\nYou affiliated with who?
