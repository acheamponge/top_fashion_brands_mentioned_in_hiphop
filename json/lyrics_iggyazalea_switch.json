(Ooh)\nThis is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch\nThis is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get\nRed light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Ooh)\n\n[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]\nMe and my boo on a worldwide hustle\nYou know what it is when I flex that muscle\nI don't even know what a real one do\nTalk that talk, I can back it up too\nGot yo dessert, call me the waiter\nI'm flirtin', you get it later\nYou could get it from the inside out\nNo hands, you could put it in your mouth\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Anitta & Iggy Azalea]\nChange the game (Change it up, change it up now)\nSwitchin' up the game (Switch it up, switch it up now)\nThere I go again (Here we go, here we go)\nPlay your role, play you ro-o-ole\nFantasy (Fantasy)\nTurns reality (Turn reality)\nRight in front of me (Right in front of me)\nI can have it anyway I want\n\n[Chorus: Iggy Azalea & Anitta]\nRed light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Ooh)\nThis is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch\nThis is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get\nRed light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Ooh)\n\n[Bridge: Iggy Azalea]\nUh, it's Iggy bitches\nWhat you want?\nWhat you want, want, want?\n\n[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]\nSwitch it up, the Lamb, the Bentley truck\nHe don't love you, that ring ain't big enough\nIf they talkin' that money I'm showing up\nMy account getting bigger, it's growing up\nAnd I'm still a ma'fuckin' rockstar\nPopstar but I roll with the mobsters\nYacht club on the shore eating lobster\nWhile I'm stunting in Geneva with my top off\n\n[Chorus: Iggy Azalea & Anitta]\nRed light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Ooh)\nThis is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch\nThis is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get\nRed light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Ooh)\nRed light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Switch it up on 'em)\nThis is about the time you recognize I'm that bitch\nThis is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get\nRed light, yellow light, green light, switch!
