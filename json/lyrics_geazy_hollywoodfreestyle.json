Young Gerald\nHipHopDX, Hollywood Freestyle, shwoop, hehe\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou know what we came to do\nTurned up on some roof with a crazy view\nOff a couple of drugs I can name a few\nGoing till I got the spins like a Lazy Sue\nThis motherfucking life I lead\nCrazy ass motherfucking life I lead\nRoll up let me light this weed\nMan this shit's moving fast but I like this speed\nNow every day I'm faded, feeling like I made it\nThat's a lie, but every night a different bride gets naked\nShe just gives it up and then I take it\nI really do this shit but you just fake it\nMoney coming in now let me rake it\nI make a batch of brownies and then we bake it\nAnd my mind is so gone, rolling up more tryna get in my zone\nFuck going out, man, I'm quite fine at home\n'Bout to call an old ex cause I'm trying to bone\nYeah, always drunk on the daily\nThis lifestyle is crazy, I got bands like Katy\nRap until I turn eighty, Mac Dre albums raised me\nThis shit is so wavy\nYou can hate it's all gravy, you can hate it's all gravy\nOkay, I'm always coming up with an absurd flow\nI was signing hella boobs up at your show\nTold her put it in her mouth and then jerk slow\nShe was pretty fucking smart as far as nerds go\nAlways paid like I serve blow, all I do, earn dough\nMy flows special like I learned slow\nAnd I see your trying to win it's my turn though\n\n[Outro]\nHipHopDX, Young Gerald, G-Eazy\nHollywood Freestyles, shwoop"}]}
