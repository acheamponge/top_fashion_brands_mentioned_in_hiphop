{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Intro]\nYeah, la-da-da-da-da-da, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nSaid colt 45 and two zigzags baby that's all we need\nWe can go to the park, after dark\nSmoke that tumbleweed\nAs the marijuana burn we can take our turn\nSingin' them dirty rap songs\nStop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong\nAnd sell tapes from here to Hong Kong\nSo roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems\nFeelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale\nSkatin' on Dayton rims\nSo roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe Deville\nIf my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet marijuana will\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell it was just sundown in small white town\nThey call it East Side Palmdale\nWhen the Afroman walked through the white land\nHouses went up for sale\nWell I was standing on the corner sellin' rap cds\nWhen I met a little girl named Jan\nI let her ride in my Caddy\nBecause I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan\nWe fucked on the bed, fucked on the floor\nFucked so long I grew a fuckin' afro\nThen I fucked to the left, fucked to the right\nShe sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white\nThought to myself sheeba-sheeba\nGot my ass lookin' like a zebra\nI put on my clothes and I was on my way\nUntil her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet\nAnd so I ran I jumped out the back window\nBut her daddy he was waitin' with a two-by-four\nOh, he beat me to the left, he beat me to the right\nThe motherfucker whooped my ass all night\nBut I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad\nThat's the best damn pussy I ever had\nGot a bag of weed and a bottle of wine\nI'm gonna fuck that bitch just one more time\n\n[Chorus]\nSaid colt 45 and two zigzags baby thats all we need\nWe can go to the park, after dark\nSmoke that tumbleweed\nAs the marijuana burn we can take our turn\nSingin' them dirty rap songs\nStop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong\nAnd sell tapes from here to Hong Kong\nSo roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems\nFeelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale\nSkatin' on Dayton rims\nSo roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe Deville\nIf my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet marijuana will\n\n[Verse 2]\nI met this lady in Hollywood\nShe had green hair but damn she looked good\nI took her to my house because she was fine\nBut she whooped out a dick that was bigger than mine\nI met this lady from Japan\nNever made love with an African\nI fucked her once, I fucked her twice\nI ate that pussy like shrimp-fried rice\nDon't be amazed at the stories I tell ya (tell ya)\nI met a woman in the heart of Australia\nHad a big butt and big titties too\nSo I hopped in her ass like Kangaroo\nSee I met this woman from Hawaii\nStuck it in her ass and she said \"AIEE\"\nLips was breakfast, pussy was lunch\nThen her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch\nI met Colonel Sanders wife in the state of Kentucky\nShe said I'd fry some chicken if you'd just fuck me\nI came in her mouth, it was a crisis\nI gave her my secret blend of Herbs' n' Spices\n\n[Chorus]\nSaid colt 45 and two zigzags baby thats all we need\nWe can go to the park, after dark\nSmoke that tumbleweed\nAs the marijuana burn we can take our turn\nSingin' them dirty rap songs\nStop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong\nAnd sell tapes from here to Hong Kong\n\n[Verse 3]\nI met Dolly Parton in Tennessee\nHer titties were filled with Hennessy\nThat country music drove me crazy\nBut I rode that ass and said, \"Yes, Miss Daisy\"\nMet this lady in Oklahoma\nPut that pussy in a coma\nMet this lady in Michigan\nI can't wait 'til I fuck that bitch again\nMet a real black girl down in South Carolina\nFucked her until she turned into a white albino\nFucked this hooker in Iowa\nI fucked her on credit, so I owe her\nFucked this girl down in Georgia\nCame in her mouth, man I thought I told ya\nMet this beautiful sexy ho\nShe just ran across the border of Mexico\nFine young thing said her name's Maria\nI wrapped her up just like a hot tortilla\nI wanna get married but I can't afford it\nI know I'm'a cry when she get deported\n\n[Chorus]\nSaid colt 45 and two zigzags baby thats all we need\nWe can go to the park, after dark\nSmoke that tumbleweed\nAs the marijuana burn we can take our turn\nSingin' them dirty rap songs\nStop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong\nAnd sell tapes from here to Hong Kong\nSo roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems\nFeelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale\nSkatin' on Dayton rims\nSo roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe Deville\nIf my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet marijuana will\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen I say \"Afro\", you say \"Man\"\nAfro, Afro\nWhen I say \"Afro\", you say \"Man\"\nAfro, Afro\nWhen I say \"Smoke some\", you say \"Weed\"\nSmoke some, Smoke some\nWhen I say \"Smoke some\", you say \"Weed\"\nSmoke some, Smoke some\n\n[Interlude]\nAye, y'all make some noise right about now\nLa-da-da-da-da-da\nI wanna thank y'all for playin' this song over the years, you know what I'm sayin'?\nLet me bust this last verse right quick, I'ma take y'all away, man, check me out, you don't stop\n\n[Verse 4]\nHave you ever went over a girl's house to fuck\nBut the pussy just ain't no good\nI mean you gettin' upset because you can't get her wet\nYou in the wrong neighborhood\nSo you try to play it off and eat the pussy\nBut it take her so long to cum\nThen a dude walk in, her big boyfriend\nAnd he asks you where you from\nSo you wipe your mouth and you try to explain\nYou start talking real fast\nBut he already mad cause you fucking his woman\nSo he start beating on you ass, check\nNow your clothes all muddy\nYour nose all bloody\nYour dick was hard but now it's soft\nYou thought you had a girl to rock your world\nAnd you still gotta go jack off\n\n[Chorus]\nSaid colt 45 and two zigzags baby thats all we need\nWe can go to the park, after dark\nSmoke that tumbleweed\nAs the marijuana burn we can take our turn\nSingin' them dirty rap songs\nStop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong\nAnd sell tapes from here to Hong Kong\nSo roll, roll, roll my joint, pick out the seeds and stems\nFeelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale\nSkatin' on Dayton rims\nSo roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe Deville\nIf my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet marijuana will\n\n[Outro]\nMan, man\nMan, man", "title": "Crazy Rap (Palmdale Sessions)", "album": "Happy to
