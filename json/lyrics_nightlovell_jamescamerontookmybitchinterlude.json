We view nature as something that belongs to us. It doesn't belong to us\n\n[Interviewer]\nAnd in the middle of this there's a great big love story?\n\n[James Cameron]\nThat's right, exactly. If that weren't enough *chuckles*\nIt's like those old RonCo ads: \"it slices, it dices\". It's one big love story\n\n[Interviewer]\nAnd somewhere in the neighbourhood of less than five hundred million dollars to make...\n\n[James Cameron]\nYeah, I think it's safe to brag about that"}], "artist": "Night Lovell"}
