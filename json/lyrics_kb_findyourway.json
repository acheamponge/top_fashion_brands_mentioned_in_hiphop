Are you an ornament?\nGoin' back to the basement when he's had enough\nA trophy on the wall again\nDon't wanna be lonely, but on this arm again\nBut he's still raisin' up his arm again\nThat's why I'm callin' in, because it all came in\n\n[Hook: Michael Stokes]\nShe remembers life as prom queen\nDating the captain of the team\nShe continues, the star of the venue\nShe know life don't sell you dreams\nBut people do, but people do\nBut you gotta find your way\nBut people do\nBut you gotta find your way\n\n[Verse 2: KB]\nYou're too small, too short, too tall\nNot big enough, thick enough\nPen to the fall, they'll change it all\nEverything before was wrong\nGirl, you can keep up\nJust leave it all\nLook, you'll be fine\nSpend your life tryna be a ten when that ten ain't worth a dime\nThey can teach you to catch his eye, I'mma teach you to catch his heart\nCause if you catch his heart you will always have his eye\nBut you'll always be a bride, you will always be desired\nYou're a masterpiece, not a piece to be mastered, your master\nYou are not a side, your the Master's piece\nThat makes you flawless, flawless\nRegardless, you're a loved woman\nWho taught you to hate your skin?\nWho taught you to hate your lips?\nWho taught you, huh?\nWho saw you and made you live?\nWho sought you and made you His?\n\n[Hook]\nShe remembers life as prom queen\nDating the captain of the team\nShe continues, the star of the venue\nShe know life don't sell you dreams\nBut people do, but people do\nBut you gotta find your way\nBut people do\nBut you gotta find your way\n\n[Bridge: KB & (Michael Stokes)]\nYou got it\nIf don't nobody else tell you\nYou got it, you got it, you got it\nIf don't nobody else tell you\n(You gotta find your way)\nIf don't nobody else tell you\nIt's all a dream\n\n[Interlude: KB]\nSee, never put God after another man\nOr another man will become your God and God will be another man\nThink like a woman, act like a woman that's beautiful\nYou're our Eve not because you're connected to Adam's holiday Your fantasy of being noticed is already a reality\nWake up\n\n[Hook]\nShe remembers life as prom queen\nDating the captain of the team\nShe continues, the star of the venue\nShe know life don't sell you dreams\nBut people do, but people do\nBut you gotta find your way\nBut people do\nBut you gotta find your way"}], "artist": "KB"}
