Do you see?\nTravel so far to get to the past\nAnd I turned back and looked into the future\n\n(Chorus) Priest X2\n\n(Interlude) Priest\nIn the beginning there was the pen and the pad\nAnd the pad was without form, no writing\n\n(Chorus) Priest\n\n(Interlude) Priest\nAnd the spirit of the hand moved across the path\n\n(Chorus) Priest"}]}
