Cause you're only in love with the chase.\"\nThen she gets up and leaves\n\n[Hook]\nBut I think I feel that this time it's different\nEverything about you wants to stimulate my senses\nSomething so intoxicating happens in your kisses\nLithium lips, it's those lithium lips, it's those\nBut I think I feel that this time it's different\nEverything about you wants to stimulate my senses\nSomething so intoxicating happens in your kisses\nLithium lips, it's those lithium lips, it's those lips\n\n[Spoken]\nNow I don't ever fall in love\nBut on nights like this, when nimbus cloudlets of black fluff circle the skyscrapers\nAnd the pulse of the city breaths new depths\nThat cleanse the palate of self\nI have encounters like this\n\nBut I think I feel that this time it's different\nEverything about you wants to stimulate my senses\nSomething so intoxicating happens in your kisses\nLithium lips, it's those lithium lips, it's those\nBut I think I feel that this time it's different\nEverything about you wants to stimulate my senses\nSomething so intoxicating happens in your kisses\nLithium lips, it's those lithium lips, it's those lips", "year": null, "album": "11:11", "title": "Lithium Lips"}], "artist": "Mac Lethal"}
