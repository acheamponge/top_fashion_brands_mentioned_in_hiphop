I thought he was a spaceman, am only playing fam\nI'm looking at short skirts, Raybans\nHigh heels and fake tans\n\n[Bridge]\nHows you night gone, you got a light hun\nIs that your man he's a right blag\nSomebodys coming home with me tonight\nHigh heels, Fake tans\n\nWe go stumbling down the stairs I'm wavey\nHold me up\nHows your night cuz, you got a light blud\nSo is that your girl, she mite still\nSomebody is coming home with me tonight\n\n[Hook]\nI mite do something I regret tonight, I don't care\nCause when I wake up...\nI - I - I I won't remember\nI won't remember a thing\nIf only you could stay like this for ever\nThen I'll be living the dream, dream dream\n(Your comin with me)\nAy ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay\n\n[Verse 2: Dappy & Margs]\nIt feels like the night couldn't get any better\nFeel like any girl I want, I can get her\nI'm getting hot, I might take of my top\nBut I'll still make it rain\nBetter get an umbrella\nWhat ella ella forget about your fella\nGot a table full of great goose and don't please\nPut your purse back in ya bag, tonights on me\nNever know tomorrow you could be on page 3\nFall to the floor, feeling bad like a jagerbomb\nNo jetski can ride this wave I'm on\nWho knows, if I wave my wand\nI might turn your girl into a baby mum\n\nSo don't you wish your boyfriend had a uh like me\nI'm looking at short skirts, raybans\nHigh heels, Fake tans\nWe go stumbling down the stairs am wavey\nHold me up\n\n[Bridge]\nHows ya night gone, you got a light hun\nIs that man he's a right blank\nSomebodies comin home with me tonight\n\n[Hook x2]", "year": null}], "artist": "Dappy"}
