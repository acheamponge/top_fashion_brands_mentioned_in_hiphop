Do you really want my damn help?\nNo no\nNo no\n\nYou do not want my help, I'm not good\nFor those stupidities of the councils\nAll the help I give is in vain\nThey just end up making me pain\nThey just end up making me pain\nWith my advice, they just want to be painted\nOnly painted, only painted\n\nI try not to give too much help that ends up being in vain\nI do not pretend to be anyone's best friend but I guess\nGiving my help to the people who do not correspond I finish\nDamaging me in some way or another\n\nSeriously? Do you really want my damn help?\nNo no\nNo no\n\nYou do not want my help, I'm not good\nFor those stupidities of the councils\nAll the help I give is in vain\nThey just end up making me pain\nThey just end up making me pain\nWith my advice, they just want to be painted\nOnly painted, only painted\n\nI try not to give too much help that ends up being in vain\nI do not pretend to be anyone's best friend but I guess\nGiving my help to the people who do not correspond I finish\nDamaging me in some way or another\n\nSeriously?
