Bush\nWe must load mental ammunition and bust\nThus, I'ma hold you down, I got you\nOne more repetition, I'ma spot you\nThis is for my blue collar workin', beer guzzlin'\nBootleg, DVD sellin', keep hustlin'\nPush, if you represent the struggle then push\nPeep the pieces of the puzzle and push\nNever let 'em place a muzzle, just push\n\n[Outro: Mela Machinko & Pharoahe Monch]\nKeep on, keep on, keep on, keep on\n(Push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push)\nKeep on, keep on, keep on, keep on\n(Push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push)\nKeep on, keep on, keep on, keep on\nKeep on, keep on, keep on, keep on", "year": "2006-09-11"}]}
