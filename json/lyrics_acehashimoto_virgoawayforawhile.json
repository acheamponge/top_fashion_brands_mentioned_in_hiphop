Believe me\nI know, but I wish that it was that easy\nI gotta go...\n\n[Hook] (x2)\n\nI know that you're falling hard and fast (x2)\n\n*chorus plays, slows down*\n\n[Outro: brandun DeShay]\nI know you can't lie for me\nI'mma see you happy even if it's not for me\nJust words... I love you...", "year": null, "album": "All Day DeShay: AM"}], "artist": "Ace Hashimoto"}
