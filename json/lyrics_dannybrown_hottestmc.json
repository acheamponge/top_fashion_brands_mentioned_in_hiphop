I wish I'd thought of that shit\"\nRhymes so real thought I wrote it in Janis Joplin's vomit\nWith the mic GG Allin wiped his ass with\n\n[Verse 2]\nI carry the cross for all my niggas lost but findin the rhyme\nDays of no sunshine like a maze in my mind\nNo enter or exit, Adderall anorexic\nPill-poppin' dyslexic, naughty nature Treach shit\nI think about my next line like you think of the next dime\nI'm the future and the present, same damn time\nAn OG told me \"only nice as your last bar\"\nSo with that said, suck my dick all y'all\nThe Motor City where motor mouths get impounded\nI'm overseas, Australia, lookin' for the blondest\nKsubi jeans, and Ann Demeulermeester\nAnd she like my shoes so I put it in her kiester\nIt's the hybrid like I wrote it in papyrus\nKeep the shit on me, nigga, hood rat baby diaper\nThey heatin' up Caprice like a DC sniper\nRaised off of hot dogs, down the middle slice em'\nI\u2019m hotter than Andre Rison with Left Eye\nRest in peace, baby, but no TLC in my life\nAnd when I reach my fate, and I'm standin' at the gates\nKnow that God'll be proud, sayin' \"Daniel, you was great\"\nBut you other niggas? 'Pac said he want an explanation\nBig turned in his grave, an earthquake in Grenada\nWhen Pun shed a tear it hurricane for a week\nWhen Big L get upset and start tornadoin' trees", "year": "2013-01-01"}], "artist": "Danny Brown"}
