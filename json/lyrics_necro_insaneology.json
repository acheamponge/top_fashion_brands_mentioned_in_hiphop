Ron Hubbard thought he was Satan, you wish you were me\nThe scientologist gynecologist doin' abortions ritually\nFree Masonry's why Michael flipped\nTom Cruise's brain is microchipped, they cleared his mind completely then recycled it\nTravolta's been trapped since '75\nBefore \"Welcome Back, Kotter\" they soddered his brain open with blotters\nPolitician occultists hexin' humans with complex infections\nThat bludgeon, cause they hold grudges like Stryker from X-Men\nIt be the God like Marquis de Sade, the Priesthood of Mendes\nSacrificing chicks like Lizzette Melendez\nLike Trevor Peres and Sean Martin on Fenders\nWe're rugged thuggin' shout to my Insaneology members, DIE!!!!!!!!!"}], "artist": "Necro"}
