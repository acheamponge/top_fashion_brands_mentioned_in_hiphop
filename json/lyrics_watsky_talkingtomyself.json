You will never get it\nThat\u2019s okay\n\n[Chorus]\nHave you felt a little off today\nHad a lot to say\nBut wound up talking to yourself?\nI've been hunting for a kindly ear\nBut couldn\u2019t find one near\nAnd wound up talking to myself\n\n[Verse 2]\nHad a little spot\u2014where you been going through a lot\nWanna shove it to the bottom\u2014but a trouble gonna bubble to the top\nThen the bubble gonna pop\u2014and the hustle never ever gonna stop\n'Cause you get up in the morning get ahead, get to bed and then you do it all again until the moment that you drop\nYou need a plot\u2014what you wanna witness with this life you got?\nYou kicked and fought tryna get up in your skin and pick this lock\nThat ticking clock lets you know that bitch you got these situations witchu\nIssues someone fit to quick should sit you down to talk\nEver wonder who\u2019s the crazy the one\u2014people walking to work as if nothing is off\nBut if a person really got it they would be cracking a bottle on somebody\u2019s head and looting from shops\nAre there times you\u2019re alone knowin' nobody\u2019s home, but you walk around mutterin' under your breath second guessing shit saying, \"Goddammit, goddammit, goddammit,\" just whispering soft\nDo you ever get lost, deep in your thoughts, tripping when you think about the cost of seeing this through?\nWhen you tie your stomach into knots that you don\u2019t know how to undo\nBut do you ever have another moment after that, when you can see\nThere\u2019s no one way this has to be? Or maybe that\u2019s just me\n\n[Chorus]\nHave you felt a little off today\nHad a lot to say\nBut wound up talking to yourself?\nI've been hunting for a kindly ear\nBut couldn\u2019t find one near\nAnd wound up talking to myself\n\n[Outro]\nDada-da-da-da-da\nHow you feeling today?\nDada-da-da-da-da\nHow you feeling today?\nDada-da-da-da-da\nHow you feeling today?\nDada-da-da-da-da\nHow you feeling today?\nDada-da-da-da-da\nHow you feeling today?\nDada-da-da-da-da\nHow you feeling today?\nDada-da-da-da-da\nHow you feeling today?\nDada-da-da-da-da\nHow you feeling today?\nDada-da-da-da-da\nHow you feeling today?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/caf3c17709b04ff24300da4d62da46fa.630x630x1.jpg", "album": "x INFINITY", "title": "Talking to Myself"}]}
