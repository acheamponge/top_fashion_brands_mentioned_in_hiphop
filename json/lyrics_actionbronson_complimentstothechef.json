{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1: Action Bronson]\nCompliments to the chef, the baby lamb was perfect\nNow I smoke the drugs that got me feelin' like I'm surfin'\nDusk on the North Shore, hash on my person\nRoll it to a snake then I wrap it like a turban\nWe in the jungle with the shaman\nTryna find these answers to these problems I've been ponderin'\nNow these motherfuckers hollerin' with their lips puckered like collagen\nSell me the world, and my kids, put them in colleges\nBut daddy get it by himself on the reg\nStuffed zucchini flowers, mix ricotta with the egg\nChopped parsley, soft flakes, Himalayan mines\nMeditation time help me penetrate the mind\nDecember 2nd '83, I was created\nMy vision's wide of the human being jaded\nIt's just reality, dealt with on a daily basis\nBig Body put the burner in these bitches faces\n\n[Hook: Lauriana Mae]\nOh, they're selling dreams out here in every corner store\nPawn 'em on the streets, I feel, they're selling me the world\nBut if it all goes up, it could all come down the same\nSo when I go where I go I remember where I came...\nRemember where I came from\n\n[Verse 2: Action Bronson]\nYo, yo can lead a horse to water but you can't make 'em drink it\nTwo in the pink, two in the stink\nLeather colored goulash, talks with Lou Dobbs, create some new jobs\nIn '87, saw my father in a blue Saab\nRight seat sittin', left hand shiftin'\nYou know that every team needs a Paxson and a Pippen\nBronson rappin' like he on an acid tab trippin'\nYou changin' with the moon with a Maxi Pad drippin'\nHigh-five love, 5'5, plump\nSell the pussy 'til the shit look like a Ty Cobb glove\nBring me back the money then I dip to Arizona\nPut my balls in your mouth, bubble tea, tapioca\nSmoked shark, speakin' in a Nordic slang\nBaby blue eyes, important like an August rain\nClear water from the creek keep me nourished\nKeep my head up, never discouraged, pussy bitch\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Lauriana Mae]\nYeah... remember where I came from...\nRemember where I came from...\nYeah... remember where I came from...\nRemember where I came from...", "title": "Compliments To The Chef", "album": "Underground Airplay 2: The New York Renaissance ", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7ffd16641cd517c9ff09083c1aedd959.500x500x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
