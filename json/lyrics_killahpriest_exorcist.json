Somebody's watchin' me\nParanoid drinkin' Coca-cola\nThe coffee cup spills over, I grab soda-after-soda\nA drive-by shootin' at a weddin', so upsettin'\nWhite gown, rice rose petals, blood spreadin'\nFuckin' then killin', killin' then fuckin'\nMy brain's empty, my heart feels nothin'\nMy left side is numbin'\nI ask myself, lemme ask you somethin'\nTryna catch my breath while I'm tryna write somethin' so fresh\n\n[Killah Priest]\n80 grams of Dilaudid, dopa- troponin\nHydromorphone, my eye's low, I morph into a King\nHoldin' idols of the mammoth, gaff mist of stream\nA psychedelic, angelic, relic\nUsed to bind Leviathan's wings\nA night perish, his wife's precious\nHoldin' his head, slide off his helmet\nLizard face, she drops 'em\nLooks around the reptilian race wit long part tongue\nMy pupils dilate, my brain goes cuckoo\nI must annihilate, I leap yoo-hoo\nI feel great, a basket full of snakes\nUpon the tablets, a long beard, a stone I still scrape\nA poem of madness, I shot the devil on Easter eve\nBehind hell's walls, you can still hear his wife grieve\nShe wore white on his funeral\nAll dead animals came back to life, it was beautiful\nLookin' unusual, a long trench-coat, lookin' grim\nGround hems spend smoke, slightly build posture\nIt's Priest the Mobster\nA sick smile, holdin' his next vic', a small child\nCould it be the next Savior?\nLook for more millennium flows\nFuturistic poems in my comic book of reality\nCalled the stargazer papers"}]}
