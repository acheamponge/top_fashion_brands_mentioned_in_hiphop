I gotta take shit\nAy there go my book... I been looking for this book\n\nWhat, What... Yea\n\n[Nas]\nI ain't seen as much death, nor seen as much crime, since the blackout in Queensbridge in 79'\nEverybodies a killer now... pimps, playas, and dons\nShorties on the block, push drops and carry on\nNiggas look through our window, where ever we drove\nThrough the tint, to see if the Benz is matching the clothes\nWe the Queens Kings\nI used to view the cats that I owe... see things...\nThat made me real, but my skin and my soul\nGirls who turned hoes\nFriends who turned foes\nBad luck niggas who bring Death where ever they go\nNever sleep, it feels better to know... it's all real though!...\n\n[Hook:]\nEverything Is Real... And... Where We Heading Now... Up to more Money... It be More Fun... Leave with Mo' Bitches... and Carry More Guns\n\nWhere We Heading Now... Where We Going Yo... Getting Real Son... We Gon let It Flow... Leave with Mo' Bitches... And Be More Dough... It Be More Fun... Holding More...\n\n[Nas]\nHow the hell, are we supposed to excel from the street...\nWhere the Jakes Crew face young kids who wanna eat\nQuantum Leap to this Black World, Hustlers, and Ghettos\nCell mates, millionaires, who tussle with the Devil\nBust a lil metal lead (led)\nWrestle you... to the pebbles... on the hard gound\nThat's if the God's down\nIt's a struggle, brothers jump bail\nTo come chill with they niggas on the block, with them rocks for sale\nOn the hard with the god Shapelle... a Queens Conrad\nYo run and come with the dime bag\n\n[Shapelle]\nYo, Yo-Yo\nAyo I need dat\nI got to smoke dat...\nSell me some Chunky Black\n\n[Nas]\nSo I could smoke away the pain\nTry to find my brain\nBut the thought still remain\nYo it's on again\nOnce the jail take these chains\nCause I been through it\nThe drug game I thought I knew it\nI got knocked, went to trial\nBut I blew it\n25... but only lived 20 years of my life\nTook 5 from me\nGot me wrapped up like a Mummy\nNow I'm in the system... aka the Devil's Home\nWhere they tell you where to eat, sleep, shit, and use the phone\nNow I'm living with... drug dealers, and chain stealers...\nBitch niggas, who got knocked and turned squealers\nImagine sharing a cell with a rehabilitated addict\nWho love fucking with faggots\nBut I sip alot of Savage\nI sat him down, and made him study mathematics\nNow I'm sitting in the cell thinking...\nAbout this reefer I'm a get this weekend\nOn the V.I. (visit)\nI rather be... uh, dam, dam\n\n[Fades Out]"}], "artist": "Nas"}
