And I just woke up\nWalked to the window and opened the shades up\nSun so bright that I can hardly see\nBut I'm a black man\nSo I pass on a tan\nDip to the bathroom take me a shower\nBut first called up my girl told her be ready in an hour\nI was still a bit tired man I'm laggin'\nGrabbed the tooth brush to kil the dragon\nOoh have mercy great day in the morning\nTurn on the water and I'm stretchin' and yawnin'\nTryin' to get a blender to hot with the cold\nMan I'm young but why I feel so old\nGet it just right then step to the mirror\nRubbin' my eyes to make my vision get clearer\nEverything looks a-o. K\nAnd today is gonna be a lovely day\n1 - (a lovely day)\nLovely day\nLovely day\nLovely day\nLovely day\nSo I jet out the crib and hop in the benzo\nToday is my girls day and all of my friends go\nJust me and her top down on the highway\nIf you're gonna do it then why not do it the fly way\nFirst a car wash next the barber shop\nThen off to my girls crib that's my next stop\nA dozen roses a card and candy\nI'm a true mackadocious mr. Romanty\nShe hoped in and she asked where we're goin'\nYo we like a twig in the nile we just flowin'\nMaybe to the beach or maybe hook up a picnic\nBut yo it doesn't matter cause today we just kickin' it\nI threw in my homemade slow tape\nAnd off to the beach for some beautiful landscape\nMan this is a bonafide lovers delight\nGot the ocean on the left the mountains on the right\nI said yeah cause that's the way I was feelin'\nFree as a bird got the clouds for a ceiling\nI wish that I could rest my gas and fly away\nToday has been a lovely day\nRepeat 1\nIt's dark outsid", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8624e4a6fdfb9b83008647b72d71bbee.371x371x1.jpg", "album": null, "title": "Lovely Daze"}]}
