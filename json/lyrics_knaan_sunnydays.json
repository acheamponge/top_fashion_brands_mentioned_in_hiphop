I'm just trying to make you happy!\n\n[Chorus:]\n(Sunny days)\nNope, don't have \u2018em no more\nWhatchu on the phone for?\nDon't call me no more\n\n(Sunny days)\nNah, so don't agonize me\nI can't stand the stress, see I'm alright without you\n\n(Sunny days)\nSee I'm far from your reach now\nYour body doesn\u2019t tempt me... well, maybe just a little\n\n(Sunny days)\nYea, on the real, like welfare checks\nYou and I are through... through...\n\n[Verse 2:]\nAlright, I'm vexed\nAite, look, I'm tired and stressed\nDon't command me like that, cool it\nI'll be back, watch Dr. Phil or something\nGet yourself straight, you a lil too excited\nThis ain't your birthday\nYou might as well be a rapper talking all that shit\nWhat the -- you throwing things? Aite, that's it!\nYou gon\u2019 fix it!
