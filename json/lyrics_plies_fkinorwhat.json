(what we doing?)\nWhat we doing? (what we doing?)\nWhat we doing? (what we doing?)\nI'mma ask you straight up!\n\n[Verse 1]\nLike I ain't really like tryna like be funny\nBut i'll send you on your way and give you gas money\nCause I ain't pressed on this end about no pussy honey\nCause I don't really like need like shit from you\nTold me come scoop you up and I did that\nI told you \"I ain't with the games\" and I meant that\nAnd after certain type of hours I don't chit-chat\nBut when the sun goes down that's when the shit happens\n\n[Bridge]\n\n[Hook]\nIs you fucking or what? (haa, haa)\nIs you fucking or what? (haa, haa)\nIs you fucking or what?\nTalk to me, let me know\nIs you fucking or what haa?\nIs you fucking or what? (haa, haa)\nIs you fucking or what? (haa, haa)\nIs you fucking or what?\nTalk to me, let me know\nIs you fucking or what haa?\n\n[Verse 2]\nHope you ain't got me on a humbug\nCause if you do you can pack up\nI ain't tryna waste you time baby\nI just ain't with the pump faking\nOh you tired? Oh you sleepy?\nTryna show me you ain't easy?\nYou can do it like easy\nJust lock the door when your leaving\n\n[Bridge]\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm just tryna beat your bakes off (brakes off)\nGet ya butt booky naked baby take off (take off)\nI'm just tryna beat your bakes off (beat your brakes off)\nGet ya butt booky naked baby take off (take off)\nI ain't tryna tougue wrastle (wrastle)\nI'm just tryna get an answer (get an answer)\nIf you ain't then you ain't that's cool\nIf you is then lets make it happen\n\n[Bridge]\n\n[Hook]", "year": null}]}
