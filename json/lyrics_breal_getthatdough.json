Can you make your way home?\nMetal for metal I'm pullin and refusin to settle\nSome are payin the piper, I'm ignitin the fire\nHigher and higher I'm movin and you're losin desire\nAll you got is your hustle, ain't no time for no hassle\nMuscle for muscle they blast you and smash you laughin at you\nOn the move for your riches, where you burnin your bridges\nCheddar for cheddar but really can you handle the business?\nOn the streets you're a legend, all the money you're spendin\nBottle for bottle pretendin your reign is never-endin\nNever wanted the glory, so for nothin I'm sorry\nBody for body I'll smoke you just like a Rastafari\n\n[Hook] - fades out", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a84f5f2a93fac34de0ebb0407f26b392.600x600x1.jpg", "year": null}]}
