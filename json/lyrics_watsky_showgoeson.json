Stine\nGotta try because I got a fool's chance\nGrab the mic at a middle school dance\nTake it from the DJ and I rap until they pull the plug out on me to stop it or until I get pants'ed\nFuck it, they can pull the plug I'm gonna kick it acapella, Dockers at my ankles, and I tell em what I'm feeling\nEven if nobody is listening I yell it to the ceiling and I celebrate the fact that I'm alive and I'm breathing\n\n[Chorus]\nAlright, already, the show goes on\nAll night, till the morning we dream so long\nAnybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun go\nJust remember when you come up\nThe show goes on\nAlright, already, the show goes on\nAll night, till the morning we dream so long\nAnybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun go\nJust remember when you come up\nThe show goes on", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c29f84b2362a2e43218c9c9f8eb13126.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "A New Kind of Sexy", "title": "Show Goes On"}]}
