My heart is a fortune cookie, full of verbs that say Go!\nJump. Fight. Win, but my soul is held captive by this state I'm within, I fight\nWars amongst Gods. Amongst demons and angels\nThey're more strengthened than I, more sharp and more angled, more\nCapable than me, yet I've\nNever found the ability to allow my hope into reclination\nI've been from the bottom to the top with a forceful desperation\nWith a need that can match the longing of a thousand suns\nA thousand tongues wishing for what we know is love, I\nKnow nothing but struggle, the constant\nHustle and bustle of attempting to make it past myself\nAnd everything else, a storm is approaching...\nAnd it's beckoning my roots\nPulling them forth, stretching them beyond what I'd deemed physically possible\nI am finding strength in places I thought I'd never know\nLength in places I thought I'd never grow\nReminding myself to never be hindered or rendered worthless\nBy the evils of this Earth, or\nThe rain or the pain or all of the hurt\nI have a heart like a hill\nLungs like gills and I, breathe underwater\nA body like motion, a soul like the ocean\nMy mind is like Teflon..My heart is too tall\nI'm more than the cloth from which I was torn, I\nLive above it all.
