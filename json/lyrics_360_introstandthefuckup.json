Wenn der Bruno mal tot geht?\nWo landen diese Sachen, wo landen diese Instrumente?\nWas wird daraus?\n\n[Intro]\nMy life is all I have\nMy rhymes, my pen, my pad\nAnd I done made it through the struggle, don't judge me\nWhat you say now won't budge me\nWhere I come from, so often\nPeople you grew up with are layin' in a coffin\nI done made it through the pain and the strife\nIt's my turn now, my world, my might, my light\nMy life, my life\nMy life\n\n[Ad-Libs]\nUh-huh\nOi, stand the fuck up, idiot!\nTommy Sixx, bitch\nYeah\nFlight so rare, it's too fast, I don't care\n\n[Verse]\nHi, I am off my face\nI am happy because life's great\nI am usin' the music I do\nWhile refusin' to do any job I hate\nAnd I party like nobody else\nAnd if you ain't down then I'm on my way\nWakin' up on a random couch\nLike, \"Who the fuck are you? This is not my place\"\nI am ready for whatever they bring\nIf you think you the shit, yo, step in the ring\nCompetitive as ever, I am everything\nAnd put in energy to never think a negative thing, no\n\"So why do you call yourself 360?\"\n\"Wanna rap, ayy? Fuck out of my face\" Fuck off\nStop thinkin' you can take my crown\nAll of y'all should just lay right down\nStop sayin' that I changed my sound\nI'm on top of my game right now\nGive a fuck if my sound is changin'\nYou should see the amount I'm savin'\nAnd plus I'm attracted to beats\nWhen you're listenin' in and the ground is shakin'\nWatch everybody love my shit\nI ain't even on that punchline tip\nBring the haters out, you can hate me now\nGuess what? You can suck my dick\n\n[Outro]\n'Cause this is my life\nThis is my life"}]}
