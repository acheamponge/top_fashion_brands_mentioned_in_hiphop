True Hollywood Story..\nTrue Hollywood Story.. True Hollywood Story..\nTrue Hollywood Story.. True Hollywood Story..\nTrue Hollywood Story.. this is a True Hollywood Story..\n\n[Canibus]\nYo I vaguely remember 1974, when I was born\nSoon as the doctor cut my ambilical cord, he put me in my mother's arms\nI was cryin when she looked down at me\nShe was smilin cuz I guess she was happy (Coochie-coochie-coo!)\nShe absolutely had no idea\nI was flowin cuz it wasn't quite clear (You so cute!)\nShe just kept ticklin me and ignorin me (Weeeee!)\n\n[Hook]\nTrue Hollywood Stories.. True Hollywood Story..\nTrue Hollywood Story.. True Hollywood Story..\nTrue Hollywood Story.. True Hollywood Story..\nTrue Hollywood Story.. this is a True Hollywood Story..\n\n[Canibus]\nMy native home was Jamaica (No problems man)\nWe moved to the states a few years later\nI had trouble fittin in (What did you say?)\nCuz I had a funny speech impediment\nPeople couldn't understand what I mean\nUsed ta talk real fast, zeen (Sha oh)\nI used to wear cross-colored jeans\nRasta belts with the red, gold, and green\nMy man used to boost travel pocket for me\nTrue Hollywood Story\n\n[Hook]\nTrue Hollywood Stories.. True Hollywood Story..\nTrue Hollywood Story.. True Hollywood Story..\nTrue Hollywood Story.. True Hollywood Story..\nTrue Hollywood Story.. this is a True Hollywood Story..\n\n[Canibus]\nIn '93 I met the Lost Boyz\nWithout them, I wouldn't even have a voice\nI showed the world I was nice with the verbals\nThat's how I got signed to Universal\nI released two albums, in all sold 9 hundred and 99 thousand\nOver the years, a lotta' people tried to diss me\nCuz I grabbed a piece of hip-hop history\nThank God that the drama didn't destroy me\nTrue Hollywood Stories\n\n[Hook]\nTrue Hollywood Stories.. True Hollywood Story..\nTrue Hollywood Story.. True Hollywood Story..\nTrue Hollywood Story.. True Hollywood Story..\nTrue Hollywood Story.. this is a True Hollywood Story..\n\n[Canibus]\nI took a trip to England with Pac-Man\nFive months later we met Stan\nHe was cool so we let him join the band\nAnd introduced him to the rest of the Horsemans\nThen I hooked up with this cat named Lou (Lou-minatti)\nAnd he was cool with C-4 too (plus two)\nNow the whole crew's on tour with me\nTrue Hollywood Stories\n\n[Hook]\nTrue Hollywood Stories.. True Hollywood Story..\nTrue Hollywood Story.. True Hollywood Story..\nTrue Hollywood Story.. True Hollywood Story..\nTrue Hollywood Story.. this is a True Hollywood Story..\n\n[Canibus]\nThis is a story about beef\nArrogance, lies, and deceit\nThis is an independent release\nAnd that's why it's totally depended on the streets\nI ain't got no record label behind me\nMaybe nobody got the balls to sign me\nBut it's cool cuz soon they'll all be callin me\nThis is a True Hollywood Story..."}]}
