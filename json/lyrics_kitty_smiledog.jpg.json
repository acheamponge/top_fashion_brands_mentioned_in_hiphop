It upsets you\nYou want me to fade out\nAnd I am the rap game pest, get your raid out\nAnd I got your ass obsessed, no shame\n\n[Hook]\nI'm not really interested in hittin' the tip top\nAnd I got you mad but you're watchin'\nYou say, \"This little white girl is ruining hip hop\"\nI say, \"Damn right!\" and take a lick of the Ring Pop and smile\nNowhere near the tip top\nAnd I got you mad, but you're watchin'\nYou say, \"This white girl is ruining hip hop\"\nI say, \"Damn right!\" and take a lick of the Ring Pop and smile\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm the kitten kaboodle and now I'm all over Google\nAnd I am very Youtube-able\nWith the Beautiful Lou beats and hideous cuticles\nYou hide out in your cubicle and ponder whose daughter I am\nA diabolical plot of the industry and\nWe didn't think anybody would be into me and umm\nI don't give a crap, I get happy\nEnough to have your favorite rapper twitterin' at me\nAnd A&R sayin' I could be a star\nAnd I'm way stressed, I just wanted a Betsey J dress\nAnd some time off from Claire's so I could chill for a while\nSo I take a lick of the Ring Pop and smile\n\n[Hook]\nI'm not really interested in hittin' the tip top\nAnd I got you mad but you're watchin'\nYou say, \"This little white girl is ruining hip hop\"\nI say, \"Damn right!\" and take a lick of the Ring Pop and smile\nNowhere near the tip top\nAnd I got you mad, but you're watchin'\nYou say, \"This little white girl's ruining hip hop\"\nI say, \"Damn right!\" and take a lick of the Ring Pop and smile"}]}
