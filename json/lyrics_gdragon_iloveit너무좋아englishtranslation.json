My eyes\nGo\u2005to that butt (I love it)\nWithout\u2005knowing, my hands\nGo to your waist (ooh I like it)\nYour thin ankles are in\nHigh heels all day baby\nCould you be my lady\n(cuz I know you want it)\n\nThis is a club or a bar, sky lounge\nSky high. Not casual but dress up\nMore. Don\u2019t stop and keep going\nRose, Dom P, with a cigar\nAre you turned on?\nIf you\u2019re not, never mind\nParty like Met Gala\nThe way we party is different\n\nYour eyes and the way you talk, I love it\nYour long hair and your beauty\nMark on your nose, I love it\n\nYou see that? My eyes\nGo to that butt (I love it)\nWithout knowing, my hands\nGo to your waist (ooh I like it)\nYour thin ankles are in\nHigh heels all day baby\nCould you be my lady\n(cuz I know you want it)\n\nIt\u2019s not important what time\nIt is or where we are\nDon\u2019t ask me who I am\nOr what I do, girl\nJust enjoy the moment\nAnd go home later. And keep this\nA secret between us\n\nYour black stockings (I love it)\nYour red lipstick (I love it)\nYour sexy smile (I love it)\nEverything about you (I love it)\nHer lips and scent\nI love it\nYour long legs and\nShort skirt, I love it\n\nWhere did you come from?\nWhy did you appear now?\nHow can you be so perfect?\nI\u2019m always in awe when I see you Is it\nToo bright? I\u2019ll turn down the lights\nLook carefully so I can show you my\nMoves. Rather than the fairy and\nWoodsman, it\u2019s the lady and playboy\n\nYour eyes and the way you talk, I love it\nYour long hair and your beauty\nMark on your nose, I love it\n\nIt\u2019s not important what time\nIt is or where we are\nDon\u2019t ask me who I am\nOr what I do, girl\nJust enjoy the moment\nAnd go home later. And keep this\nA secret between us\n\nYeah\nGotta love it\nBrought to you by GD\nBoys Noize, Zion T\nAnd your girl\nI love it"}]}
