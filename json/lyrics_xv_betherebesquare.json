Popular Culture!\nAy, Xaphoon you crazy!\nYea!\nSee my grandma she would always tell me, set out to be something, not someone. You\u2019ll figure you out\n\n[Verse 1]\nI used to rap like Mase, back in 9-8\nWith a bubble goose and black pager strapped to my waist\nActing like Harlem was a half a mile \u2018way\nThem niggas at the mom and pop would laugh in my face\nForgot I was a dude from a very small place\nSmallville fills, mama brought me my cape\nSaid if they call you a square, don\u2019t get bent out of shape\nLet them gay niggas hate boy cause you gon\u2019 be straight\nYeah, I used to rap like Biggie\nBut I wasn\u2019t from Brooklyn and weighed less than 150\nShoveled snow to get Versace, girls still didn\u2019t dig me\nI was like Dwayne Wayne if he didn\u2019t have Whitley\nBobby without Whitney, Stooges without Iggy\nMickey without Disney, in other words it ain\u2019t fit me\nSo that lasted long as the braids on 50\nI decided to be myself even if they didn\u2019t get me\nI\u2019ma\n\n[Hook x2]\nBe there, be square\nAnd I\u2019ma see y\u2019all when you get here\nLet me see those L7\u2019s in the air\nLet me see those L7\u2019s in the air\n\n[Verse 2]\nI used to rap like Hov before I got signed\nHigh school talent shows, throw up the Roc sign\nPouring liquor on hoes, sipping on white wine\n\u2018Til I realized that whole life was not mine\nI never seen Jigga play Chrono Trigger\nSneak out the house just to go out and skateboard with his niggas\nTell me if his favorite Nirvana song is Sliver\nCut down the family tree, I just can\u2019t relate to you niggas\nSo I speak for those who are not spoken for\nOn Twitter and Bossip, gossiping if I\u2019m gonna blow\nI\u2019m on they heels, they probably wearing open toes\nSold out shows across the globe, my label barely even knows\nYou watch a throne, I just see a chair\nAnd a crown that I\u2019ma get and not even wear\n\u2018Cause before I got on, they didn\u2019t seem to care\nSo I said fuck yo circle, I\u2019ma be a square\n\n[Hook x4]"}], "artist": "XV"}
