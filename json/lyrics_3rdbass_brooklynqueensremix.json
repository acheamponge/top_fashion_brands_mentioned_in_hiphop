I could do this\"\nListen closely, slowly took a swig of intoxicants\nCause the Brooklyn Queen's a gold digger\n\nChorus (2X)\n\nVerse Three: MC Serch\n\nSquared away.. with my digits and tonight's plans\nWhen I feel a crab grab my right hand\nSlapped her on the back, tried to calm her\nAsking her, \"Now what's the reason for the drama?\"\nHer next move was straight out of textbook\n\"Haven't we met before?\" Giving me a sex look\nYo Wisdom, your lyrics are in bad taste\nSo I'm forced to give you nothing but the Gas Face\nYou better go, for hoppin on the cab or bus\nCause you're downtown and you're simply too fabulous\nBut get this, ain't this a humdinger?\nShe stepped to a retard sportin a four-finger ring\nSomewhere in the skin tight jeans\nI'm gonna scoop the best of the Brooklyn-Queens\n\nChorus\n\n\"Brooklyn's in the house\"\n\"Brook, Brook, Brooklyn New York!\"\n\"Brooklyn's in the house\"\n\"Brook, Brook, Brooklyn New York!\"\n\"Brooklyn's in the house\"\n\"Brook, Brook, Brooklyn New York!\"\n\"Brooklyn's in the house\"\n\"Brook, Brook, Brooklyn New York!\"\n\"Brooklyn's in the house\" (4X)\n\nVerse Four: Pete Nice\n\nLast exit to Brooklyn I enter\nCarefully the Queen holds my scepter\nGettin numb like a Derelict on scotch\nI'm Dick Lewis, cause baby I'm watchin you\nScheme on a brother for a knot\nTo choose between the have and the have-not\nDo you doubt the shade of vanilla?\nI'll play Elvis and you play Priscilla\nOh he's no hero, better yet Billy Dee\nAdvertise cheap liqour for a fee\nA Brooklyn Queen, rushes Russell Simmons\nThat's like Tyson rushin Givens\n\nChorus (4X)\n\n\"Brooklyn's in the house\" (4X)\n\"Brooklyn's in the house\"\n\"Brook, Brook, Brooklyn New York!\"\n\"Brooklyn's in the house\"\n\"Brook, Brook, Brooklyn New York!\"\n\"Brooklyn's in the house\"\n\"Brook, Brook, Brooklyn New York!\"\n\"Brooklyn's in the house\"\n\"Brook, Brook, Brooklyn New York!\"\n\n.. {*long interlude*} ..\n\"Brook, Brook, Brooklyn New York!\"\n..\n\"Brooklyn..\" {*echoes to fade*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/66b094b3f4ff3a3de57feb7e3b9816d8.300x300x1.jpg", "album": "The Cactus Revisited", "title": "Brooklyn-Queens (Remix)", "year": null}]}
