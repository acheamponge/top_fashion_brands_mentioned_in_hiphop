Keed]\nJTK\nYeah\nKeed talk to 'em\n\n[Chorus: Lil Keed]\nAll these bitches coming in the Bentley truck, ooh\nNigga really trippin', got problems, start shootin'\nYeah, two twin Dracos, leave a loose goose\nYeah, two twin hoes, I ain't know what to do, yeah\nI don't mind touching your body\nWe put a whole lot of hundreds on bodies\nShe treat me like candy, she lick me like lollies\nToo many loads, yeah, I need a dolly\nToo many hoes caressing they body\nGot too many poles, I'm not worried 'bout you\nI just might crash, way she ridin', ridin'\nIt's up in my stash, not up in my pockets\nThey put on that mask and they get to robbin'\nI came a long way, they killin' everybody\nWe came a long way, we not just anybody\nCartier frames, I don't see anybody (Let's go)\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Duke & Lil Keed]\nYou know we way far from regular\nNow I'm booked up with a too busy schedule\nYSL shit, ain't no way that we scared of you\nShoot this bitch up, we won't leave nothin' but residue\nJust got a backend, I'm thumbin' through revenue\nI got a bad bitch, she look like a trophy\nI dropped a dub on this chain like Gin\u00f3bili\nPaid twenty-four for the Act' like I'm Kobe\nI be too geeked up and I'm never sober\nMe and Keed in a Maybach, we ridin' with a chauffer\nYou can bet that I'm ridin' with a motherfuckin' toaster\nYou know Stevie stay with me, he strapped with no holster\nElliot diamonds, I just keep it kosher\nI keep it on me, watch how you approach me\nGunna just hit me, he told me keep goin'\nAnd nigga, stay down and somebody gon' notice you, yeah (Keed, talk to 'em)\n\n[Chorus: Lil Keed]\nAll these bitches coming in the Bentley truck, ooh\nNigga really trippin', got problems, start shootin'\nYeah, two twin Dracos, leave a loose goose\nYeah, two twin hoes, I ain't know what to do, yeah\nI don't mind touching your body\nWe put a whole lot of hundreds on bodies\nShe treat me like candy, she lick me like lollies\nToo many loads, yeah, I need a dolly\nToo many hoes caressing they body\nGot too many poles, I'm not worried 'bout you\nI just might crash, way she ridin', ridin'\nIt's up in my stash, not up in my pockets\nThey put on that mask and they get to robbin'\nI came a long way, they killin' everybody\nWe came a long way, we not just anybody\nCartier frames, I don't see anybody (Let's go)\n\n[Verse 2: Gunna & Lil Keed]\nI hardly say it, but I miss you, Trolly\nWhen I copped that Lam' truck, I was excited\nI hopped in the grass, peerin' out my rocket\nThe back of the Mulsanne, I'm reclining\nRhinestones in my jeans shinin' like my diamonds\nHer leggings see-through, I don't see no pantie linings\nShe told me come through and want me to combine 'em\nIf they shootin' they shot, I became a target\nYSL at the top, we control the market\nI called up SEX and said, \"Look what you started\"\nAin't goin' out sad, I sell me some narcotics\nRose gold Richard Mille, I had a rose Bvlgari\nMe and Duke killer blue, 488 Ferarri\nAin't givin' money back, ain't no say sorry\nWe put niggas on a plate like calamari (Keed talk to 'em)\n\n[Chorus: Lil Keed]\nAll these bitches coming in the Bentley truck, ooh\nNigga really trippin', got problems, start shootin'\nYeah, two twin Dracos, leave a loose goose\nYeah, two twin hoes, I ain't know what to do, yeah\nI don't mind touching your body\nWe put a whole lot of hundreds on bodies\nShe treat me like candy, she lick me like lollies\nToo many loads, yeah, I need a dolly\nToo many hoes caressing they body\nGot too many poles, I'm not worried 'bout you\nI just might crash, way she ridin', ridin'\nIt's up in my stash, not up in my pockets\nThey put on that mask and they get to robbin'\nI came a long way, they killin' everybody\nWe came a long way, we not just anybody\nCartier frames, I don't see anybody (Let's go)\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Keed]\nCartier frames with the woodgrain, yeah\nLight this shit up like it's propane, yeah\nDiamonds shining bright, yeah, the red mink clear\nThis a supercharged Range Rover, yeah, I switched the gears\nYeah, they know a nigga livin' better\nYeah, this a Maybach, drive it like a shuttle, yeah\nF&N tearin' through your shelter, yeah\nBoy, you die 'bout these three letters, yeah\nWhen I walk in the room, lay your ass down\nNo, I don't care 'bout her background\nMost of y'all niggas' drip passed down\nPink Percocet, I can't come down\nThis a Water by G choker cashed out\nThis a dirty stick, know that we air it out\nSlime got thirty clips on it, they'll air it out\nI take care my hoes, I'll pass it out, oh Lord\n\n[Chorus: Lil Keed]\nAll these bitches coming in the Bentley truck, ooh\nNigga really trippin', got problems, start shootin'\nYeah, two twin Dracos, leave a loose goose\nYeah, two twin hoes, I ain't know what to do, yeah\nI don't mind touching your body\nWe put a whole lot of hundreds on bodies\nShe treat me like candy, she lick me like lollies\nToo many loads, yeah, I need a dolly\nToo many hoes caressing they body\nGot too many poles, I'm not worried 'bout you\nI just might crash, way she ridin', ridin'\nIt's up in my stash, not up in my pockets\nThey put on that mask and they get
