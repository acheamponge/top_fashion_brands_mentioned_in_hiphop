Yeah what was in ya feed?\nWhere do you get to with the internet lead?\nThings do change and change can have a range\nSystems shouldn't operate by sticking me in a cage\nAin't Dalai Lama\nAin't Sai Baba\nMy words are my armor and you're 'bout to meet your karma", "year": "2013-11-05", "album": "Matangi", "title": "Karmageddon"}], "artist": "M.I.A."}
