Rose\nEasier than shooting Freethrows (Freethrow) Easier than wearing Polo (Polo)\nEasier than a ho at my show in the front row\nI'm nonchalant she a debutante yo girl need a tummy tuck\nMy verse is B.G. that's short for bubble guts\nI'm 2 Chains, Chains so Big you could play double dutch\n2 blunts, put together, bitch that's a double dutch uh"}], "artist": "2 Chainz"}
