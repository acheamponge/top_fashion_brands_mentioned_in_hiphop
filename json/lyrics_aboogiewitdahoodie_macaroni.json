I make a call, nigga get you gone\nKnew that was your girl but she a ho and her pussy soak\nSound like macaroni in a bowl when she mix it up\nKnew I was gon' put it in the song\nWe ain't get to fuck\nThink about when you leave her home\nWhere she really at?\nProbably got location on your phone, she know where you at\nA lot of niggas hatin' on the boy\nWhy you really mad?\nIs it 'cause I'm really putting on where my city at\nHighbridge, nigga from the Bronx where it be gritty at\nI be smoking on gorilla glue and smoking GG pack\nThey don't wanna free my nigga Nun but I know he be back\n\n[Chorus]\nBitches that I hit up in the DM never hit me back\nNow they probably all up in my DM, I don't get to check\nI could turn your girl into a demon, boy, don't get me mad\nFuck around and threw out all my singles when I heard it clap\nSound like macaroni in a bowl how she getting wet\nWhen I met her said she was a fuckin' bartender, yeah\nThen I saw her dancing on a pole, she a stripper, yeah\nMacaroni in a bowl, she be mixing, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy nigga don't tell me what to do\nMel went to school for shooting hoops and then he learned to shoot\nHad to lock myself inside the booth, that's how I kept my cool\nSaw my nigga Quado on the news, that's why I kept my tool\nDon't you try to tell me nothing, nigga, you don't know me\nDone with this bottle, fill me up I need another Ros\u00e9\nGot to hit a couple hittas up when I'm by my lonely\nI think they already know wassup, I don't fuck with phonies\nLately I been running out of time, I need another Rollie\nLately I been on the west-side, don't need no other homies\nDiamonds on my pinky finger blinding, all the bitches on me\nI look at her and tell her call me, hold up matter fact\n\n[Chorus]\nBitches that I hit up in the DM never hit me back\nNow they probably all up in my DM, I don't get to check\nI could turn your girl into a demon, boy, don't get me mad\nFuck around and threw out all my singles when I heard it clap\nSound like macaroni in a bowl how she getting wet\nWhen I met her said she was a fuckin' bartender, yeah\nThen I saw her dancing on a pole, she a stripper, yeah\nMacaroni in a bowl, she be mixing, yeah\n\n[Outro]\nMacaroni in a bowl\nThe way she mix it up\nThe way she mix it in a bowl\nThe way she mix it up\nMacaroni in a...mix it up"}], "artist": "A Boogie Wit da Hoodie"}
