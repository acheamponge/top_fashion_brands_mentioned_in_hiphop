I'd wait, my friend, but I don't know how\nDon't want to leave but I don't want my demons to return and haunt this house\nThe foundation's, The foundation's\nBroken\n\n[Verse 2:]\nBut you know it's dead wrong that I ain't never felt so right\nThe heart and the mind, they don't always coincide\nEvil dig a ditch, he cover it with pride\nHe come to webilize we weave to try and hide\nThe truth is on a mission to make his way to the light\nIt knows it has it's right to take flight\nThe universal laws are too strong to fight\nOne day it's going to set up shop in plain sight\nTime can ice the pain and try to hide the stain\nAnd glue it back together yet it's never quite the same\nEven if she forgives you, she decide to stay\nThat memory live inside her until her dying day\nShe goes through the pages of history with a heavy heart\nScratching question marks next to all the precious parts\nYour best memories start to develop scars\nWould've never thought it'd ever fall apart but\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nI use to find a hiding place inside your tight embrace\nNow all I see in your face are my mistakes\nToo much time I done placed around snakes\nSaw the apple, had to know how it tastes\nI acted out of ego, acted out of lust\nActed outside of the trust we had in us\nI acted out a scene from a film I had seen before\nStill casted myself in that leading role\nWhen I was finished playing, I stood there saying \"See? \"\nBut there was no director yelling \"Cut\" to keep it clean\nThe camera kept rolling and went behind the scenes\nThe bonus material from the DVD\nThe audience is watching, yelling at the screen\nSaying \"Say it isn't so, please tell me it's a dream\"\nI use to be the gleam in your eye but that died out\nNow I'm that little streak of white in your eyebrow\n\n[Hook x2]", "year": "2012-02-15", "album": "The Bite Marked Heart"}], "artist": "Brother Ali"}
