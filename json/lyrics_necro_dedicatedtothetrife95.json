I'm kicking this rhyme for crime\nAnd kids that sell dimes but don't drop em'\nFor thugs that plot, shop for thugs that got pistols for sale\nSelling more crystals than Gale\nTough guys that snuff guys for looking\nGet arrested and spend the whole night in central booking\nFrom Brooklyn to Manhattan\nTo Bronx to Queens\nTo Shoalin and Strong Island\nViolently I get fucking greens\nFor the heads with cash and flip hash\nAnd got a stash of loot that's trife\nGod bless your life\n\n(Chorus)"}], "artist": "Necro"}
