You get hit with your CD, too\nRunnin' outside cryin', lyin', denyin'\nThat you ain't The Gay Rapper but you got fucked by him\nWhat's the difference? Y'all niggas still ain't in lyrical fitness\nToo busy mixin' your bidness with your bitches\nWhile I be in the lab composing forbidden scriptures\nSo wicked, I got Satan ejaculating on his fingers\nLike Dirk Diggler in the middle of Boogie Nights\nSniffin' white, living the hype, he ruined his life\nBut I'm a MC of a different type, yeah, that's right\nMake sure your shit is tight or I'ma snatch your mic, nigga\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen I say, \"Can-I,\" you say, \"Bus\"\nCan-I (Bus!), Can-I, (Bus!)\nYo, when I say, \"Can-I,\" you say, \"Bus\"\nCan-I (Bus!), Can-I, (Bus!)"}]}
