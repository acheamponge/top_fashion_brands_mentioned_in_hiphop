(I'm a Ghetto soldier)\nMy right hand itchin' been had money kid\nI even opened the umbrella in the crib\nBought my girl some shoes she didn't walk out of my life\nNo bad luck I skipped the Po twice\nNo superstition just wise intuition\nOn the battlefield, get killed to do the killin\nBy the way my good luck charm is a biscuit\nGhetto soldier till the ending\n\n[Hook: Akon]\n\n[Verse 3: Papoose]\nNo pain no gain all the trauma is killin me\nPain can't swim that's why I drown in the Hennessy\nTied to the enemy run in your crib slump you in your fireplace\nAnd have smoke comin out of your chimney\nI can see straight through your plot and your trickery\nIt don't mean shit to me\nI'm tryin to get to the bottom of it\nBut I lost a whole lot of my energy\nTryin to get to the bottom of a bottomless industry\nNowadays all I got is my pride and my dignity\nYou ridin with sympathy they say misery needs company\nWhy keep them company you kiddin me?\nWhen I can grab a weapon and put him out of his misery\nSend shots at you to tell you I'm not playing\nWhen you fire back you let me know what you saying\nThis gun bustin it's like an unspoken language\nWe communicate with our gun this shit is dangerous\n\n[Hook: Akon]", "year": null}]}
