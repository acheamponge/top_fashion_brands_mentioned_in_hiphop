Am I a tad worse than\nAnybody who's ever committed mass murders?\n'Cause I'm killin' their entire trust in men\nI feel like I\u2019m evil 'cause they'll never feel that lust again\nBecause of me, and now I only trust my friends\nBut honestly, yo, I'm wishin' I could love again\nAny problems of their own and they blame mine\nIt's like a script, always kickin' all the same lies\nAny heroin junkie, we have the same mind\nBecause we love it and we hate it at the same time"}]}
