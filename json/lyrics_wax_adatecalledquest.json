Yes he can\nBig Wax and EOM represent represent\nAnd it's a Tribe Called Quest represent represent\nWhen the mic is in my hand I represent my squad\nMy favorite jam back in the day was oh my god\n\n[Verse 1: Wax]\nNow listen up everybody, the bottom line\nThe night is on my mind but the sun is still shining\nRiding on the train with no dough and it sucks\nBuggin' out in my mind thinkin' about how to get some bucks\nWhen I saw this cute female\nAss was kinda fat reminiscent of a whale\nYoung girl desires started fillin' my mind\nIf there's one thing I've learned\nIts good girls are hard to find\nSo I had to act as if I had more game than parker brothers\nAnd I walked over to her feeling smooth like butter\nI said hola chicka, so nice to meet ya'\nI asked for her name, she said, Bonita, Bonita\nI said you got to put me on, I had a crush on her\nLike if she was John from NPO, she needs a mighty good man\nWhen I asked if we could kick it she said yes we can\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Wax]\nMan\nShe had caught my heart for the evening\nAnd we agreed to meet up that weekend\nSaturday came I was ready to go like lyrics\nSo here is the scenario\nResturanto \"El Segundo\" I forgot the name\nWhen she came inside, I said I'm glad you came\nShe was lookin' stressed out, I said I know how you feel\nBut everything wasn't fair when we finished the meal\nPay for this pay for that, pay for food and beer\nWho the hell you think I am? Mr. Belvedere? Damn\nBut when I tried to dissipate her laugh\nI just pulled out my wallet an' gave the waiter the cash\nAnd when I looked at her it really didn't matter\nCause all I could see was hot sex on a platter\nMy mind was in a frenzy and a horny state\nSo when she made small talk I just couldn't relate\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Wax]\nWe went back to her crib later on that night\nI needed to freak but I was feeling up tight\nShe said 'relax, please settle down\nWe bout to knock the boots, like the group \"H-Town\"\nShe got me an E on the bedroom wall\nI thought I had it all covered like a female shawl\nI could bust off on her bed and give her a seaman's mattress\nBut I won't do that cause I got crazy prophylactics\nNext step get the jimmy hat\nSo I can do dat, do dat, do do, dat dat dat\nI reached into my pocket, to pull out my wallet\nAnd realized damn at \"El Segundo\" I forgot it\nAbsent minded is the way I am\nSo I had to yeah yeah to the K.I.M\nI went home passed out, and when I woke up\nI just did my thing solo like when tribe broke up\nYeah\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/Big_Wax_in_Front_of_a_Fence.jpg", "album": null, "title": "A Date Called Quest"}]}
