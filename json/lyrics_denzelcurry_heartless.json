DJ Screw, ooh\nNiggas be thinking they real niggas, niggas be thinking they shining\nNiggas be thinking they diamonds, my niggas movin' in silence\nYou niggas don't want a war, I lay you down with the dinosaurs\nBitch I am a Megazord, in the streets you do not win awards\nI'm high as a hoverboard, I don't compute like a motherboard\nI eat like a carnivore, none of you niggas prepared for war\nThis ain't what you heard before, roll up the green like a herbivore\nThis ain't what you heard before, roll up the green like a herbivore\nLike Jordan you stay with the bullshit\nMy nigga I'm done with the nonsense\nMy nigga I'm outta my conscience\nI'm throwin' my brain out the window\nA whole bunch of kush and some indo\nI'm bout to roll up with my kinfolk\nWith all of the things that I seen\nIt's looking just like what Bush wrote\nRoll it up, smoke it up and put it through the glass pipe\nFuck around with me, this'll probably be your last night\nFirst time she saw me, it will probably be her last time\nWhen she call me back, I'ma tell her it's a bad time\n\n[Chorus]\nI do not talk shit, I'd rather just start shit\nOut of my starship, I slept with a goddess\nOut of the darkness, I feel like a goblin\nI am so heartless, I'm feeling so heartless\nI am so heartless, why am I so heartless?\nI am so heartless, why am I so heartless?\nI am so heartless, why am I so heartless?\nI am so heartless, why am I so heartless? Yeah!"}], "artist": "Denzel Curry"}
