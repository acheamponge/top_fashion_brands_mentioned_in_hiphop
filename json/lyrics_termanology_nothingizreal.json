And well\nTermanology [?]\nNothing is real\nThis whole rap game\nShit is all fake\nWhack rappers and whack bitches\nAnd these fake politicians, yo!\n\n[Verse 1: Termanology]\nSo what's the deal, There's nothing that's real\nIt's all appearance\nWhich is what they call spirits\nCasting spells on the realist\nHookers be catching feelings\nAnd feeling like you the menace\nAll up in your business, trying to be fussy and jealous\nI learned myself, don\u2019t trust no one else\nEspecially when she tell you there ain't nobody else\nBecause she prolly tell, everyone she meet that\nIt's just a way to keep your best trust and believe that\nIf your perceived as a person that they see whack\nAnd everybody know you lie about your D pass\nThat you a sucka, and mothafuckas can see that\nPart of the reason I'm bringing your LP back\nRap dudes, fake bitches, and politicians\nThey all the same, they turn snake for minor digits\nIf you don\u2019t mind a [?] your life could all be a fiction\nNo story and wind up on a list that shits kind of fitting\n\n[Chorus: Zero 7]\nDo you believe?\nIn what you see? (I don\u2019t believe that)\nMotionless wheel (I don\u2019t believe that)\nNothing is real (I don\u2019t believe that)\n\nDo you believe?\nIn what you see? (I don\u2019t believe that)\nMotionless wheel (I don\u2019t believe that)\nNothing is real (Nothing is real)\n\n[Verse 2: Termanology]\nAnd as for these rappers\nNone of this shit is real\nCars rented jewels rented\nThey borrow and steal\n50 percent of rappers still living back at moms\n20 percent of rappers still living behind bars\n90 percent of rappers is broke and never blow\nThe other 10 are real\nThey hustle and slang coke\nIt's all a big hoax\nMost rappers have big hopes\nBut never see big doe\nIt's all a big joke\nTears on they face\nBut they ain't killing nothing\nTrying to make you scared\nLike niggas is real or something\nThis ain't a horror movie\nBut it's just as fake\nThough its horrific when you think of the musical state\nNo Pumas and breaks\nEmcees moving to place\nJust dudes that are fake\nTrying to be cool that they ain't\nYou abusing this great\nMusic with tunes you create\nStudio goons into place\nWish I can shoot at your face\n\n[Chorus: Zero 7]\n\n[Verse 3 - Termanology]\nAyo taxes\nWhy you think there's different kind of brackets\nSome people get money\nAnd put it under they mattress\nSome people are funny\nLike they rich and they above me\nBut I'm laughing at these yuppies\nLike Pac spitting at cameras\nLooking at my people's eyes\nStruggling to beat the odds\nThese politicians buy new stations and camera time\nFox News, CNN, and Channel 5\nThey all telling lies\nWhatever they fantasize\nI look into the eyes\nOf these politicians\nTake advantage of our women\nKeep em standing in positions\nWhere they pay for babysitting\nTrying to make a living\nBut it costs so much\nTo go to school they never finish\nYou can say it's all a business\nOr the government is tripping\nBut If we don\u2019t wanna listen\nThere's no way that we could switch it\nI could see all this vivid shit\nThat some people are missing\nHomie, don\u2019t you get it twisted\nNone of this shit is real\n\nNone of this shit is real"}], "artist": "Termanology"}
