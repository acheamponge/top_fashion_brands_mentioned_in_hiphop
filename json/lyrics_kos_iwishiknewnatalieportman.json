I've seen this place before\nBut it's never been so fun\nNever been so fun\n\nI've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton\nIt's starting to make sense to me\nI can't really make you love me\nNo, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no\n\nI've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton\nI know I found the recipe for me\nBut I can't really make you love me\nNo, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no\n\nYou know I'm haunted on overseas\nHaunted on each coast\nPlay them like Ebenezer\nI made them see the ghost\n\nBack from the future donned in Japanese kimonos\nEven though the streets show love, try to see me grow\nI often see me floatin', but my shadow it weighs a ton\nCall it baggage, I use it all to advantage\n\nBut I can't make you love me\nThis time it's on you\nAnd you can't try to deny\nThese words when they're true\nI'm on the run\n\nI've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton\nIt's starting to make sense to me\nI can't really make you love me\nNo, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no\n\nI've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton\nI know I found the recipe for me\nBut I can't really make you love me\nNo, no, you know I can't really make you love me\n\nOh no, ay yo, cud get to steppin'\nYour tongue is like a weapon\nThis is Kevin from heaven and yet so are ye's\n\nSince the age of seventeen\nI've been taking apart microphones\nYou've been taking apart men you've blown\nWith throwing skeleton bones\n\nIn the closet, animals strike curious poses\nThey feel the heat between us\nBut you need a woman's glorious style, diamond to fetus\nCarry my fetus, I'm like the man in the moon\nWhen we kissed and you swooned, on the run\n\nI've been on the run, this shadow weighs a ton\nIt's starting to make sense to me\nI can't really make you love me\nNo, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no\n\nI've been on the run, my shadow weighs a ton\nI know I found the recipe for me\nBut I can't really make you love me\nNo, no, you know I can't really make you love me, no, no\n\nI can't really make you love me\nI can't really make you love me\nI can't really make you love me\nI can't really make you love me"}], "artist": "\u200bk-os"}
