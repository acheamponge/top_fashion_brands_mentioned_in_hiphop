{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1: Aesop Rock]\nThe dirty dishes are becoming self-aware\nEven the roaches like \"I wouldn't raise my children here\"\nSimple syrup in his veins, dirty nails, lizard brain\nEyes wide, spine like a saltlick in pissing rain (pssss)\nASR Schroder split the rent with ghosts and bacterial cultures\nMight track poltergeists prints through his Folgers, gross\nHome is where the unholy sojourn\nDead sea bath tub\nNever mind his welfare\nParty at the penthouse carpeted in pet hair\nFridge full of black deli meat and dead air\nSill prefer it to the overbearing lens flare\nAnd death stare Plinko and an at risk eco\nSystem, egos over peace, love, and wisdom\nPolice shooting everything\nMedia's a fuck show\nReligion is a scapegoat for cut-throats\nFuck no\n\n[Hook 1: Aesop Rock]\nI ain't going out there, man\nI don't trust no one out there, man\nYou don't even know what's out there, man\nMan\n\n[Verse 2: Homeboy Sandman]\nSycophants is on the prowl so I don't need to do laundry\nI'll dry myself with paper towels\nCan't have a decent conversation with the butcher, baker, or candlestick maker\nAt least they smoking vapor now\nI still am not going to vacate and ain't breaking out\nIt's such a boring scene\nI found more buoyancy in quarantine\nAccommodations second rate\nAt least it's an environment that I can regulate\nLike I was Warren G\nI got a fan and bucket full of ice cubes\nFuck what's popping on the street\nI gotta sweep up mice poo\nI waged a war against the spiders and was left with the mosquitoes\nBut these blood suckers leave a bump\nThose blood suckers always want to free-load\nYo, who's that peeking in my key hole trying to keep it on the d-low\nPlain and simple, mine's my favorite simple mind\nSo I'm closing all the windows and I'm shutting all the blinds\n\n[Hook 2: Homeboy Sandman]\nI ain't goin' out there, son\nI don't trust no one out there, son\nI don't even know what's out there, son\nSon\n\n[Verse 3: Open Mike Eagle]\nYo, I got a big-ass TV and my house has four of 'em\nSome of y'all is cutting the cords I'm adding more of 'em\nFuck foraging, I do the shit that I can sit and do\nMaybe in the future we can fly by a living room\nOr order from Grub Hub but it ain't no pasta left\nOutside is where my distant cousins get shot to death\nPlus I'm very broke, I ain't even got a buck for the ferry boat\nIf something dope happens throw it on periscope\nA meerkat? Seen it. I ain't trying to hear that\nI'm planted in my zone because home is where it's weird at\nAnything I want I locate with little to no wait\nThrough a vast network of homies that work for post-mates\nHella spies still sitting here, so watch me rotate\nOutside is full of processed sugar and traffic jams\nDevice charged, apps in hand, I'm a handy-man\nIf you want to give me some energy come and visit me\n\n[Hook 3: Open Mike Eagle]\nBecause I ain't goin' out there, fam\nI don't trust no one out there, fam\nI don't even know what's out there, fam\nDamn", "title": "Syrup", "album": "The Impossible Kid", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dfff097ef9309401ffd2c18d161aa348.730x410x1.jpg", "year": "2016-04-29"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
