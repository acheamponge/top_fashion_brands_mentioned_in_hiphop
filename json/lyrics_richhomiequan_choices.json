I'm on the molly geeked up to the next damn morning\nAnd if you steal from me I'll kill you baby\nAbortion they say life's all about choices\n\n[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]\nI-I made choices in the past\nTo get me where I'm at\nI had to make choices in the past\nTo get me where I'm at\nIt ain't bout you, but it ain't bout me, Yeah\nIt's about that paper coming with green, Yeah\nSo much money it don't make sense no more, I'm saying\nI'm at the point where I can't get no more, I-I-I'm playing\nAround with a check so you can't fire me\nAye fuck a crew I'm tryna build a dynasty\n\n[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]\nI-I-I keep my head straight, my bed made\nI stay in touch with Billy Ray even though that fed case\nStill pending on him I pray for him everyday\nWith a 2 million bond its best he play it safe\nAnd I ain't scared to say a damn thing to the jury, ho\nWe was shooting a video how they robbed the jewelry store\nAnd they still ain't got no witness\nAnd I know it ain't none of y'all business\nBut I just want y'all to listen\nAnd see how the system tryna fuck my nigga\nF-Fucking life up, other niggas ain't like us\nMorning Breathe better try Trident, don't try us\nIt's like a fan in the battle how I'm blowing dough\nIt ain't bout where you been, it's where your going homie\n\n[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]\nI-I made choices in the past\nTo get me where I'm at\nI had to make choices in the past\nTo get me where I'm at\nIt ain't bout you, but it ain't bout me, Yeah\nIt's about that paper coming with green, Yeah\nSo much money it don't make sense no more, I'm saying\nI'm at the point where I can't get no more, I-I-I'm playing\nAround with a check so you can't fire me\nAye fuck a crew I'm tryna build a dynasty", "title": "Choices", "year": "2013-06-01", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9da455cf327f7246be36f9cefd2cd4b2.1000x750x1.jpg", "album": "Still Goin\u2019 In"}]}
