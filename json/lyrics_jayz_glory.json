Glory!\nGlory! Sorry\nEverything that I prayed for\nGod's gift, I wish I woulda prayed more\nGod makes no mistakes, I made a few\nRough sledding here and there, but I made it through\nI wreak havoc on the world\nGet ready for part two\nA younger, smarter, faster me\nSo a pinch of Hov, a whole glass of Bey\n\n[Chorus]\nThe most amazing feeling I feel\nWords can't describe the feeling, for real\nBaby, I paint the sky blue\nMy greatest creation was you, you: Glory\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour Grandpop died of nigga failure\nThen he died of liver failure\nDeep down he was a good man\nGoddamn, I can't deliver failure\nBad-ass lil Hov\nTwo years old, shopping on Savile Row\nWicked-ass lil B\nHard not to spoil you rotten, looking like little me\nThe most beautifulest thing in this world\nIs daddy's little girl\nYou don't yet know what swag is but you was made in Paris\nAnd Mama woke up the next day and shot her album package\nLast time the miscarriage was so tragic\nWe was afraid you'd disappear, but nah, baby, you magic (Voil\u00e0!)\nSo there you have it, shit happens\nJust make sure the plane you on is bigger than your carry-on baggage\nEverybody go through stuff\nLife is a gift, love, open it up\nYou're a child of destiny\nYou're the child of my destiny\nYou're my child with the child from Destiny's Child\nThat's a hell of a recipe\nGlory! Glory!\nGlory! Sorry\n\n[Chorus]\nThe most amazing feeling I feel\nWords can't describe the feeling, for real\nBaby, I paint the sky blue\nMy greatest creation was you, you: Glory\n\n[Blue Ivy Carter]\n*baby noises*", "title": "Glory", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0166212e019d3a63386df70033e648de.400x400x1.jpg", "year": "2012-01-17", "album": null}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
