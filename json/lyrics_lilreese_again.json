In it to win\nI lose that shit, get it back again\nRewind that shit, I'll do it again\nTwo Glocks, them bitches look like twins\nI'll pull up, poppin' that two at your mans\nFlip by once, flip by twice again\nFlip by once, flip by twice again\nFlip by once, flip by twice again\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Reese]\nAin't nothin' nice\nFlip by once, flip by twice\nYou get spiced like cookin' rice\nMeant for the bitch, if the bitch my type\nIf the bitch is my type, then she get one night\nPosted on my block and I got my pipe\nOunce after ounce got me high all night\nFo'nem off the flat got me high like a height\nAnd if the pockets flat, I gotta get it right\nI know this shit ain't right\nYou'll get left, on the step\nI don't need no help\nYeah fuck nigga I'll run up on him by myself\nWhen it was hard times\nWho the fuck I have? Myself\nFake niggas gonna sneak diss\nYou can keep that there\nMe switchin' up on my mans?\nBoy, that shit's so rare\nA lot of niggas say they real, but them niggas ain't real\nA lot of niggas say they real, but them niggas ain't real\n\n[Hook: Lil Reese]\nWhat you do this for? In it to win\nI lose that shit, get it back again\nRewind that shit, I'll do it again\nTwo Glocks, them bitches look like twins\nI'll pull up, poppin' that two at your mans\nFlip by once, flip by twice again\nFlip by once, flip by twice again\nFlip by once, flip by twice again\n\n[Verse 2: Chief Keef]\nYou are no street\nYou don't know nothin' 'bout beef\nGo 'head give me a 40\nI got it all on my teeth, nigga\nTo see the gang, you need to see me, nigga\nLike a CC, weed in the reef, nigga\nI eat, sleep, shit with my gat\nFeelin' like Memphis Bleek, nigga\nCountin' Euros\nRollin' with some killas\nRollin' up some pack\nI know that you smell us\nWhen we roll up on ya\nDon't look unfamiliar\n'Cause we got one choppa\nAnd 'bout 20 pistols\nWe'll be 10 cars deep\nFinna be in yo street\nOff like 4 pints\nThen I fell asleep\nPiano with my choppa\nPlay a melody\nI'm done bein' good\nSo many felonies\n\n[Hook: Lil Reese]\nWhat you do this for? In it to win\nI lose that shit, get it back again\nRewind that shit, I'll do it again\nTwo Glocks, them bitches look like twins\nI'll pull up, poppin' that two at yo mans\nFlip by once, flip by twice again\nFlip by once, flip by twice again\nFlip by once, flip by twice again"}], "artist": "Lil Reese"}
