I\u2019m just craving, bathing in your desires\nNever the type to fall head of heels if around my neck there's a wire\nCigarettes burning, hoping they calm me down\nI\u2019m out of tune, feeling never well\nWitness how I\u2019m under yo spell, Ms. Jazzy Belle\n\n[Outro: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nOh yes I love her like Egyptian\nWant a description? My royal highness\nSo many plusses when I bust that there can\u2019t be no minus\nWent from yelling crickets and crows\nBitches and hoes to queen thangs\nOver the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs\nLike Kilroy, chill boy because them folks might think you soft\nTalking like that, man, fuck them niggas, I\u2019m going off\nAnd coming right back like boomerangs when you throw 'em...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8a6459edf531c32e841bf0edb981ef34.535x535x1.png", "album": null, "title": "Jezebel"}]}
