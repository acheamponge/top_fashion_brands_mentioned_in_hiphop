Kelly:]\nHow you know me?\n\n[Kelly Price:]\n'Cause you're my brother, and therefore I can tell when something is troubling you\n\n[R. Kelly:]\nOk Ok, I give you that\nNothing's wrong, I take that back\nThere is something on my mind but sis, I don't want to waste your time\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nBut I done told you time and time again whatever you're going through...you can come and talk to me and I will say a prayer with you\n\n[R. Kelly:]\nBut I done prayed and prayed night and day\nI still can't seem to find my way\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nRob that ain't nothing but the devil telling you\nThat you're washed up and you're through, but sister's here to let you know\nBoy you're gonna make it through\n\n[R. Kelly:]\nSister, do you really believe that I can rise again?\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nYes, and not only that, Rob, God will forgive you for your sins\n\n[R. Kelly:]\nCan you tell me what to do?\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nWell, first you've gotta believe the truth\n\n[R. Kelly:]\nSometimes it's hard to believe in Him\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nThat's okay because he believes in you\n\n[Chorus: R. Kelly]\nThe winds, the rain\nThe storm\nThe weapons that are formed against us (I will survive)\nThe trying times\nThe sleepless nights\nJust know that faith is with us (and I believe, yeah)\nThrough all of the hills\nAnd valleys roamed\nTrust hat we must come to (woah)\nWalk side by side, follow the light\nAnd we'll make it through (We'll make it through yeah)\n\n[R. Kelly:]\nSo, so...What you're saying is believe a little more?\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nYes, cause faith is the key that opens up the door\n\n[R. Kelly:]\nWhat you're saying to me, it's hard to receive\nEspecially when trouble follows me\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nWhen we're keeping it real\nRobert, sometimes\nTrouble can follow where you lead\n\n[R. Kelly:]\nYes sister, I know sometimes, but I...\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nJust wait, let me make a phone call\n\n[R. Kelly:]\nTo who?\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nA prayer buddy of mine\nShe can help you tear down your walls\n\n[R.

Kelly:]\nMaybe we ought to just try...\n\n[Maurice Mahon:]\nHello?\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nShh shh, hello, is Kim there?\n\n[Maurice Mahon:]\nYes, I think she's around here somewhere\nHold on\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nNow you just let me do the talking\n\n[Kim Burrell:]\nHello?\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nHey girl, how you doin'?\n\n[Kim Burrell:]\nHey Kelly\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nMy little brother's on the line and needed advice from you\n\n[Kim Burrell:]\nOoh what can I do for you?...Hello?\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nGo ahead Rob, she's talking to you\n\n[R. Kelly:]\nOh, well, I know you must be very busy\nSo I'm not going to mess around, nah\nJust telling my sister how my life is upside down\nAnd I don't know whether I'm going left or right half the time\nI Sometimes think I'm gonna lose my mind, you feel me?\n\n[Kim Burrell:]\nMmm hmm... similar to what I used to go through\n\n[R. Kelly:]\nReally?\n\n[Kim Burrell:]\nYes, and sometimes I still do\n\n[R. Kelly:]\nYeah?\n\n[Kim Burrell:]\nSee it doesn't matter who you are\nOr where you're from\nIf you struggle, God will use you\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nAmen sister, what you're saying is so true\nRob are you there?\n\n[R. Kelly:]\nYes, I'm just listening to the both of you\nIt's so easy to say, but not so easy to do\n\n[Kim Burrell:]\nYes but if you stand the truth\nIt will free you\nJust stand strong\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nStand strong\n\n[Kim Burrell:]\nWith your head held high\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nWith your head held high\n\n[Kim Burrell:]\nSaid it won't be long\nIn time he will provide\n\n[R. Kelly:]\nWill he?\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nYes he will\n\n[Kim Burrell:]\nYou just stay in the race\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nJust stay in the race\n\n[Kim Burrell:]\nAnd keep on running\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nAnd down to the end\n\n[Kim and Kelly:]\nFor your day is coming\n\n[Chorus: R. Kelly]\nThe winds, the rain\nThe storm\nThe weapons that are formed against us\nThe trying times\nThe sleepless nights\nJust know that faith is with us\nThrough all of the hills\nAnd valleys roamed\nTrust thatwe must come to\nWalk side by side\nFollow the light\nAnd we'll make it through\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nHe'll give you peace\nIn the midst of your storm\n\n[R. Kelly:]\nSometimes I feel like it's too late for me\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nBut he'll never leave you\n\n[Kim Burrell:]\nNo way\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nYou just gotta hang on\n\n[Kim Burrell:]\nHang on\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nRobert say a prayer, keep your head\nGod will do just what he said\n\n[R. Kelly:]\nFinally I think I get it\n\n[Kelly Price:]\nYes, that's it\nThat's the spirit\n\n[Chorus: Kim Burrell+Kelly Price+R. Kelly]\nThe winds, the rain\nThe storm\nThe weapons that are formed against us\nThe trying times\nThe sleepless nights\nJust know that faith is with us\nThrough all of the hills\nAnd valleys roamed\nTrust that we must come to\nWalk side by side\nFollow the light\nAnd we'll make it through\n\n[kim Burell]\nSo if you really want it..\n\n[R.Kelly]\n..yes, I do\n\n[Kim Burrell (R.
