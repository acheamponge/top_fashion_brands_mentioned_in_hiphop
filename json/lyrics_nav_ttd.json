You know I gotta know now\nAnd I keep a couple of hitters with me, always stay ten toes down\nTen toes down\nTen toes down\nTen toes down\nTen toes down\nIs you really riding, girl? You know I gotta know now\n\n[Verse 1]\nSometimes that's how it goes\nTook a couple of Ls, so you know I am on the road\nI am all alone\nCall my shorty, yeah, she down to roll, uh\nMy bitch inspirational\nHer pussy sensational\nTheir ain't no replacing her\nBitches ain't real enough\nShe peeling a Backwood up\nShe fill it with stinky stuff\nPut the work in the truck in the spare tire\nYour daddy won't know it's there, shorty\nYou asking why I'm paranoid, shorty\n'Cause in the 6, they ain't playing fair, shorty\nIn the club, you won't see me there, shorty\n'Cause niggas want know my when-and-where, shorty\nSo you know I gotta be prepared, shorty\nAll I really know is you down for me?\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, I took a couple of Ls, so you know I'm on the road now\nKeep a bad-ass bitch and she always stays ten toes down\nIs you really riding, girl? You know I gotta know now\nAnd I keep a couple of hitters with me, always stay ten toes down\nTen toes down\nTen toes down\nTen toes down\nTen toes down\nIs you really riding, girl? You know I gotta know now\nGotta know now\nGotta know now\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou see i'm getting money now, you wanna be my bro now\nYou want a sip of lean and you want smoke dope now\nWhere your ass was at when I was calling? Car broke down\nNow you wanna use my name, so you can get hoes now\nNow you jumping on the bus, you want to see shows now\nI heard you started rapping now, you want to spit flows now\nUsed to be my dog but now you acting like a hoe, now\nYou the type to make me change my numbers to my phones now\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, I took a couple of Ls, so you know I'm on the road now\nKeep a bad-ass bitch and she always stays ten toes down\nIs you really riding, girl? You know I gotta know now\nAnd I keep a couple of hitters with me, always stay ten toes down\nTen toes down\nTen toes down\nTen toes down\nTen toes down\nIs you really riding, girl? You know I gotta know now"}], "artist": "NAV"}
