do that\nRun up if you will and get ya ass whipped blue black\nMy nigga my nerve, fresh off the curb\nJelly jam and preserve, nothin but balls and my word\nAnd a mossburg pistol grip pump on my lap at all times\nWhateva my nigga cause young niggas still dyin\nHollin bout huh, nigga what, huh, give a fuck nigga what\nFull of that weed, planted like a poppy seed\nA slanted and enchanted nappy nigga named Young Bleed Corleone\nIn the jungle, where the murder million mumble for months and days\nTrippin off these blunts we blaze, hell of a high\nAnd tellin em why, I'mma neva say die, You can see it my eyes\nAnd niggas say I fly like a eagle and see no evil\nAnd ain't no sequel to this here, this year I'm bailin in the dough\nSupernatural, wit ends, y'all niggas don't here me though\nBut see how they runnin everything on the cool\nBut they know I'm fittin to act a fool in this motherfucker\n\nChorus: Young Bleed, Master P\n\n(Young Bleed) Niggas holla how you do that there\nRoll it up, blow

pen hittin that iron gettin swole\nSent me a letter said P get yo paper don't trust these hoes\nThese niggas they'll take you, hustlin is a habit\nYoung bread cabbage, popcorn and grits nigga tryin to get a rabbit\nWhat about a nice stallion to slide in, twenty inch Vogues and some candy\nPainted to ride in, niggas flip change in the game cause we soldiers\nEyes hella red cause a nigga blowin doja\nTie the black shoe strangs, tight on the Reeboks\nGrab yo ski mask, DKNY, I mean a plastic Glock\nHoes bounce that ass, niggas get dealt wit\nKeep yo' enemy tight, nigga never thank quick\nPour out some liquor to tha homies I owe\nR.I.P. to every fuckin rapper, that is gone\nNigga if you Bout It, scream and you shout it\nIt ain't where you from, every nigga get rowdy\nGame get real, nigga guard yo' grill\nCause in the fuckin ghetto you could lose yo' life foe a dollar bill\n\nChorus: Young Bleed, Master P\n\n(Young Bleed) Niggas holla how you do that there\nRoll it up, blow it up,

musical fashion, if you don't know fool you betta ask em\nCause fools that wanna get wit I get wit em\nWhen I put my gloves on, I'm bout to get gone, so long\nPlease mama may I, go out and be a playa, sippin' on Hennessey\nA million bitches want me, my nigga passed tha herb, I took a token\nI'm stayin' true, cuz what eva' he down wit I'm down wit it too\nSo don't get full of that alcohol in tha club and thank you bad\nCuz if ya'll niggas start fuckin' up somebody gon' kick yo ass\nNow who's that makin' that funky noise, it's tha locster comin' through\nWit all his boyz, fucked up and let a
