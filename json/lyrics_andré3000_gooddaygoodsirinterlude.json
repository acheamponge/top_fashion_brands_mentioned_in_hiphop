Look fine\nFantastically well, I am certainly not fine by far\nBut you could say I'm close to spectacular\nClose to spectacular? How so?\nOpen your eyes, spectacular's right in front of you\nWhatever you say, you're spectacular\nNo, I'm fantastically well\nCome on, man, make up your mind\nA minute ago, you said you were fine\nNo, I said I'm \"close to spectacular\"\nBut I'm meetin' fine in a minute\nClose to spectacular? You said you were \"fantastically well\"\nExactly\nExactly? Which one are you?\n\"Close to spectacular\" or \"fantastically well\"?\nI am certainly and without a doubt fantastically well\nAnd was close to spectacular\nBut I must say, good sir, you just pissed spectacular off\nAnd don't even mention \"exactly\"\nBut here comes \"fine\" right now\nOh Lord, she is fine\n\n[Spoken Word Outro: Unnamed Woman, Bentley Fonzworth & Andr\u00e9 3000 and Bentley Fonzworth]\nGentlemen\nBehold\nA lady"}], "artist": "Andr\u00e9 3000"}
