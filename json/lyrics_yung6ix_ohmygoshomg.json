people waiting on me\nAnticipating on me\nGot me going\nOh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)\nSome people hating on me some celebrating for me\nGot me going\nOh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)\nThe way she put it on , way she put it on\nGot me going\nOh ma (gosh oh, gosh oh)\nThe way she put it on me got me feeling funny\nGot me going\nOh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)\nSee people waiting on me\nAnticipating on me\nGot me

chapter after mark\nThey tell me that they love me but I simply know they pretend\nSo I stay strong unlike days I got no week/weak ends\nBeat it up like Travis Barker on the drum-set\nAm so hot I swear I could make the sun sweat\nOk now let me speak\u2026 further\u2026..\nIf you ain't the customs then why should you border me?\nAm not who I used to be, feeling like another me\nIf I ain't the best then I swear there is another me-eeeee\nAnd my mama keep saying god bless you\nSo am the one but in the mirror, I'm the best too\nI came with a bat am making hits in all my sessions\nAlways win their heart like I rigged their suggestion\nTold them de gonna need a lifetime just to be me\nThem say I too deform but you don\u2019t need a pen to fill me\nAm in like vip while u out like the bouncer\nIf the best is the question then my name is the answer\n\n[Chorus]\nGot me going oh my gosh oh\nSee people waiting on me\nAnticipating on me\nGot me going\nOh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)\nSome people hating on me some celebrating for me\nGot me going\nOh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)\nThe way she put it on , way she put it on\nGot me going\nOh ma (gosh oh, gosh oh)\nThe way she put it on me got me feeling funny\nGot me going\nOh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)\nSee people waiting on me\nAnticipating on me\nGot me going\nOh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)\nSome people hating on me some celebrating for me\nGot me going\nOh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nFlow so natural, I burst like a pimple\nAnd the flow continues just like the sequel\nWe are not the-same , I am not like u people\nJust like my fingers we are not equal\nI do it big u do it squat \u2026\u2026\u2026.little\nI dey with one(1) girl but she fine like  people\nSo f\u2014 tommy am the ill-lfiger\nAll this people do is hate just like my girls figure\nNever see where am headed u gonna need my lens(eye lens)\nSteady killing the beats they screaming out, stop the violence\nLeave the beats black and blue like cops and their sirens\nAt their neck like a bow tie while I play dem like a violin\nChampagnes on me tell me what u sipping\nI must look like a journey cos I got the girls tripping\nAnd now my song is their wake up tone \u2026ya\nThey can't sleep on the boy \u2026\u2026.insomnia\nAlways in the boot like I was kidnapped \u2026..abduction\nThat\u2019s simply why am on-top and you honda(under) end of discussion\n\n[Chorus]\nGot me going oh my gosh oh\nSee people waiting on me\nAnticipating on me\nGot me going\nOh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)\nSome people hating on me some celebrating for me\nGot me going\nOh my (gosh oh, gosh oh)\nThe way she put it on , way she put it on\nGot me going\nOh ma (gosh oh, gosh oh)\nThe way she put it on me got me feeling funny\nGot me going\nOh my (gosh oh, gosh

this?\nLook at the life that I made out of all this\nNow I got ur old girl wishing that they knew (new) me\nBuilt a career of the rocks that they threw me\nLooking at a niggaa u would think they see
