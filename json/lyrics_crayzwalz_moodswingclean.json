I drool on lava rocks\nAnd keep my essays elevated like Guatemala potheads\nIn real life, there\u2019s a time when the drama stops\nAnd the teardrops goes plop like llama snot\nCaught between Timberlands and travel fox\nPast and present, from club nights to block fights\nAdolescence to a grown man with worries and bills\nI\u2019m like a smart shopper looking for a deal\nAnd all I find is bargains\u2014a hungry artist never starving\nPutting cyphers on squeeze like Charmin\nI drink water when the money\u2019s low, race my runny nose\nAnd think stronger, longer to help these dummies grow\nI don\u2019t give a fuck like a celibate mind state\nIf you don\u2019t see what I\u2019m saying, consider this a blind date\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nMood swings.  Emotional days in the park\nMood swings.  The light is but a shade of the dark\nMood swings.  Emotional days in the park\nMood swings.  The light is but a shade of the dark\nMood swings.  Emotional days in the park\nMood swings.  The light is but a shade of the dark\nMood swings.  Emotional days in the park\nMood swings.  Mood swings\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nIf you ready to die for something, you better live it\nI never dropped a album\u2014The Prelude was a snippet\nBeat a midget to death with my short end of the stick\nLife is hectic and stressful\u2014you must fight this\nMood swings.  Emotional days in the park\nThe light is but a shade of what stays in the dark\nI used to blaze trees.  Now I cherish the bark\nPlant the seeds deep, speak and inherit the art\nI got roots in this, stealing spinach out the register\nTravel light years\u2014my peers is interstellar\nNow get your groove back.  Life\u2019s a beach with broken glass\nWhere your boots at?  Pitching fast?  I\u2019ll get a hit and roof that\nI see the swerve in your curve made of bourb to be slurred\nWe preserved eternally on the street curb\u2014word\nForever I bless.  Sometimes, I get stressed and furious\nConstipated like George\u2014this shit got me Curious\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nMood swings.  Emotional days in the park\nMood swings.  The light is but a shade of the dark\nMood swings.  Emotional days in the park\nMood swings.  The light is but a shade of the dark\nMood swings.  Emotional days in the park\nMood swings.  The light is but a shade of the dark\nMood swings.  Emotional days in the park\nMood swings.  Mood swings\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nBattery tested.  When sound checked, it was fully charged\nDo not eat the remix.  Overstand the wooly gods\nSpreading views.  Intuition is the weapon used\nSeeing myself as the winner, I never lose\nI throw claps back at you and receive what I give\nReading letters my pops wrote that he never did\nTruly fact, my life booby-trapped like the groovy cats\nI could die and be back before the credit reenact the intro\nYoungest in charge, living large, pushing the Pinto\nEvidence coincides\u2014this ain\u2019t coincidental\nI got new headphones.  Lines busy, brain off the hook\nA sight for sore eyes\u2014when you go for self, it\u2019s a strained look\nMy hindsight turned to ketchup and served burgers\nDeath whispered life in my ears\u2014I heard, \u201cBirth murder\u201d\nLike a sword and a shield, I hold the rhyme and the pen\nSometimes I lose it.  On the mic, I find it again\nMy throat goes hoarse, of course.  I might need some hay\nRemember my name.  You\u2019ll be screaming it someday\nIn the mist of lead showers beyond gun spray\nLife as a traffic cop, nothing goes one way\nOn to Peter Pan listening to Pirate Radio\nFull-moon clocks.  Lunatics going crazy, yo\nRhyming on a train, I became one with the track\nUsed to stay in my shell like slugs in a gat\nI forced to react from a powerful impact\nFrom the essence.  With blessings, I will be sent back\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nMood swings.  Emotional days in the park\nMood swings.  The light is but a shade of the dark\nMood swings.  Emotional days in the park\nMood swings.  The light is but a shade of the dark\nMood swings.  Mood swings"}]}
