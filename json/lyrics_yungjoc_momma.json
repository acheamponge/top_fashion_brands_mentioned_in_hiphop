I got to have her\n\n[Chorus: Jazze Pha]\nAin't another girl on this earth, like my momma\nBut if I find that girl, I'ma make her my woman\nIf I find another girl, like my momma\nI can go unconditional love 'til they take me under\n\n[Yung Joc]\nGyeah; first thing first, where do I start\nThis feeling that I'm feeling is real it's not a facade\nThe angel that I call momma was sent by God\nBeen through thick and thin, better times, even hard\nRaisin two boys in the ghetto wasn't easy\nShit was goin wrong but she made it seem peachy\nYeah she worked long hours, whether rain and the freezin\nPulled out the Vicks vapor rub when I was sneezin\nWhen the kid laid her off and the rent was past due\nMom was a O.G., did what she had to\nI got kicked out of school, she had to talk to my principal\nYeah she kicked my ass, but her love is unconditional\nI love my momma\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Yung Joc]\nYo, yo\nI remember - my first BMX, she showed me how to ride\nShe used to lick her thumb to wipe the cold out my eyes\nOh yeah I can't forget her cookin how it stick to my ribs\nShe could take Spam and make a first class meal\nWhen my nigga Steve, me and her both cried\nAnd when I got locked up, she bailed me out every time\nGuess I'll never know how she remained so strong\nReceived Medicaid and food stamps for so long\nWe was section 8 all the way 'til I was grown\nShe played both roles, king and queen of the throne\nI'm not exaggeratin, not even to the slightest\nThis came from the heart, so I ain't even have to write it\nI love my momma\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Yung Joc]\nI'ma try to stop the music one time\nWant y'all to clap with me, c'mon\nNow if you love your momma clap yo' hands\nIf you love your momma clap yo' hands (aww yeah~!)\nIf you love your momma clap yo' hands\nIf you love your momma clap yo' hands (aww yeah~!)\nShorty, I brought you in this world, I'll take you out\nYou said it when you caught me skippin school, makin out\nMomma you stayed down, you never faked it\nStayed by my side when they thought I wouldn't make it\nAnd when I had a son, they said I need a job\nThat's when you told me son, just follow your heart\nAnd so I did that, I went through all the drama\nSo I just wanna take this time to say I love you momma\n\n[Chorus]", "title": "Momma"}]}
