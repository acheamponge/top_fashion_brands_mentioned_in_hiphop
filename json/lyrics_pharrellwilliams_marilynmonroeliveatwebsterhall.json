We're helpless romantics\nWe can not help who we're attracted to\nSo let's all dance, and elevate each other\n\nDear diary, it's happening again\nThis energy, like I'm 'bout to win\nI just close my eyes and visions appear\nShe's everything I want, and it's crystal clear\nNot even Marilyn Monroe\nCleopatra please\nNot even Joan of Arc\nThat don't mean nothing to me\nI just want a different girl\nGirl, girl, girl, girl\nGirl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough\n\nWhy, why do I have to lie?\nPretend, make believe or hide her?\nWhen I love what I've described\nBut then again, I don't need no adjectives for this girl\n\nDear diary, it's happening again\nThis energy, like I'm 'bout to win\nI just close my eyes and visions appear\nShe's everything I want, and it's crystal clear\nNot even Marilyn Monroe\nWho Cleopatra pleas\nNot even Joan of Arc\nThat don't mean nothing to me\nI just want a different girl\nGirl, girl, girl, girl\nGirl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough\n\nDear diary, it's happening again\nThis energy, like I'm 'bout to win\nI just close my eyes and visions appear\nShe's everything I want, and it's crystal clear\nNot even Marilyn Monroe\nWho Cleopatra pleas\nNot even Joan of Arc\nThat don't mean nothing to me\nI just want a different girl\nGirl, girl, girl, girl\nGirl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough\n\nWhat's wrong with that?\nWhat's wrong with that? Yeah\nWhat's wrong with that?\n\nIn honor of the groove and all who's surrendered to it\nWe say thank you, and we take it back\n\nWe're so hard, I was so hard that they can't chew\nThen my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon\nI put my arms around her, and I promise not to abuse you\nSince now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you?\n\nDear diary, it's happening again\nThis energy, like I'm 'bout to win\nI just close my eyes and visions appear\nShe's everything I want, and it's crystal clear\nNot even Marilyn Monroe\nWho Cleopatra pleas\nNot even Joan of Arc\nThat don't mean nothing to me\nI just want a different girl\nGirl, girl, girl, girl\nGirl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough\n\nDear diary, it's happening again\nThis energy, like I'm 'bout to win\nI just close my eyes and visions appear\nShe's everything I want, and it's crystal clear\nNot even Marilyn Monroe\nWho Cleopatra pleas\nNot even Joan of Arc\nThat don't mean nothing to me\nI just want a different girl\nGirl, girl, girl, girl\nGirl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough", "year": null}]}
