I was kneadin' this dough\nLong as your math is fast, if your readin' is slow\nYo, my life ain't rosy but I roll with it\nMy mind was fine 'til the dough hit it\nThen told me that the Mo' did it\nAnd now it's Kosher, shit is so Hasidic\nI blow a digit on the diamond at San Trop\u00e9 visits\nAnd won't miss it, so don't twist it\nYoung is just as nice and more risks than '96, KID\n\n[Chorus]\nD-P 3, YES!\nWashingtons go to wifey, you know how that go\nJacksons go back then we cop us some mo'\nThe Benjamins go in the stash box under the floor\nI'm out for presidents to represent me, now you know\nD-P 3, D-P 3\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy boy Sig said\nHe was on a tier where no tears can fall\n'Cause he was on the block where no squares get off\nSee in my inner circle, all we do is ball\n'Til we all got triangles on our wall\nAin't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record\nI recall, 'cause I've really been there before\nNever far behind, 'cause I think too forward\nAll about the grind like me so horny\nWarned you early on about my mindset\nYou thought it was an empty bomb threat\n'Til I flew into the building like 100 Osamas\nSaid to do a few millions\nExpose the world to a hustler's true feelings\nI came into this game with nothing to prove\nYou'll never stop a nigga in that type of mood\nSo every move I make confuse the industry\nI'm out for presidents to represent me\nD-P 3\n\n[Chorus]\nD-P 3\nWashingtons go to wifey, you know how that go\nJacksons go back then we cop us some mo'\nThe Benjamins go in the stash box under the floor\nI'm out for presidents to represent me, now you know\nD-P 3", "title": "Dead Presidents III", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf0f68ee56f29c8542ad805c6419682b.676x676x1.jpg", "year": null, "album": null}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
