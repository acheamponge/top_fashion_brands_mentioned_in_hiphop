Listen I swear to Je\u2019\nI feel like Baby back in 99\nIn the SLS stunting and it's all mine\nShitting on these nigga sipping on some Swiss Kriss\nI got some jewelry on it, sittin\u2019 on ma\u2019 slit wrists\nMy label fucking up my flow, see I'm getting pissed\nWork too damn hard fam, for the shenanigans\nDon't hang around bums, and that's how I win, fe fi fo fum\nHaters, how do my cum taste? No more fun, no jokes, no smile\nJust a grin that suggest I'm the best\nLiving like I got a motherfucking pump on my left at all times\nSo many kids live their life through my rhymes\nSee I'm in love with you all 'til the end\nWhen shit was dark for me you were my only friends\nOn the realer, so smoke some tree for your nigga\nAin't nobody got my bounce, know my juicy ounce\nWalk in rooms and fuckboys close their mouth\nThe Cud life, you know what we about\n\nLord of the Sad and Lonely"}]}
