Don't get me wrong\nI will do some toot you know. You know if you're partying and everything\nAnd somebody comes up and gives it to you\nIts impolite not to take it there\nSo me and my girlfriend, Sally, we, you know, we party man I tell you\nWe do party. You know, I will do some toot\nWe'll do, you know\nOn a good weekend there we call a bunch of friend over\nWe'll do bout an eight ball of toot there but we don't base\nI do not freebase cocaine. I want to make that clear. I don't do it"}], "artist": "2 Chainz"}
