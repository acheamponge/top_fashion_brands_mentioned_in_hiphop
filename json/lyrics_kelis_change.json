I would know\nDon't wanna let it grow like poison\n\n[Verse 4]\nNow don't be silly\nNo one clears their conscience\nBlown out proportion\nSilly me, I cried, for weeks, an ocean\n\n[Chorus 1]\nYou can't escape the grips of desire;\nYou lie to yourself, but you'll always remember\n\n[Bridge]\nWhat can I say? Nothing can change\n\n[Chorus 1]\nYou can't escape the grips of desire;\nYou lie to yourself, but you'll always remember\n\n[Chorus 2]\nYou can't escape the grips of desire;\nAnd you lose yourself\nThen you lose yourself\nCan't forgive yourself, oh no"}], "artist": "Kelis"}
