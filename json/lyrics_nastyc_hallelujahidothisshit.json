"[Intro]\nBase\nShout Black, you're a fool homie\nOh yea, it's finna be some new rules around here\nHol' up\n\n[Hook: Nasty_C]\nI woke up feeling large\nI woke up, wrote bars I was feeling like Nas\nI woke up, said \u201cNah, fuck the law I'm finna roll one, take charge\u201d\nI woke up feeling big\nI woke up in the crib, I was feeling like Pac\nDon't you ever get it twisted, I paint the picture vivid, It's my life to live so just watch and get used to it\n(I do this shit)\nNigga get used to me (I'm not new and shit)\nNigga I used to be (on some foolish shit)\nNow I just do this shit (like its a movie, bitch)\nNigga get used to it (I do this shit)\nNigga you're puke to me (who the fuck are you and shit?)\nNigga get used to me (I'm not new and shit)\nNow I just do this shit (I do this shit)\n\n[Verse 1: Nasty_C]\nI had a feeling I'ma take it home\nI had a feeling I'ma rape this song\nI had a feeling I'm not as good as\nBut I'm good enough to take him on and break his arm\nI been strong (Been strong)\nAnd I bench y'all (I bench y'all)\nLife's a bitch, you got friend-zoned (you got friend-zoned)\nIf life's a trip I'm in the finest whip, I'm tryna find a strip club, you're sent home\nI light a spliff then I get high as shit and try to find a bitch and tell her get low\nI write this shit not to confine but rather get mine across to all them folks\nSometimes I sit tryna find why I still try to commit, knowing I got ten hoes\nNow I know my mind is twisted, get a bible in this bitch, in life that's all we depend on\n\n[Bridge: Nasty_C]\nHallelujah (Amen)\nI'm tryna hold on to my soul (uh-huh)\nBut the devil tells me if I let him on it I'll blow\nSays he knows I long for gold and I don't wanna die old\nBut I'd rather say no, let my cojones hang low, nigga\n\n[Verse 2: Nasty C]\nSo uuuh, not\nI'd rather get pastors to pass me a blessing, get on right\nAnd we all night, we after this cash, your bitch ass only crass, I go hard twice\nGet Patron, lights off\nFuck doing shows if they offer the wrong price\nNow put on a smile, I'm on till I'm off life\nI'm stretching my arms like\nBiatch\n\n[Hook: Nasty_C]\nI woke up feeling large\nI woke up, wrote bars I was feeling like Nas\nI woke up, said \u201cNah, fuck the law I'm finna roll one, take charge\u201d\nI woke up feeling big\nI woke up in the crib, I was feeling like Pac\nDon't you ever get it twisted, I paint the picture vivid\nIt's my life to live so just watch and get used to it\n(I do this shit)\nNigga get used to me (I'm not new and shit)\nNigga I used to be (on some foolish shit)\nNow I just do this shit (like its a movie, bitch)\nNigga get used to it (I do this shit)\nNigga you're puke to me (who the fuck are you and shit?)\nNigga get used to me (I'm not new and shit)\nNow I just do this shit (I do this shit)\n\n[Verse 3: Nasty_C]\nI swear the nights are gritty but the life is pretty, your wife is with me and she get it\nShe got still big titties, I got 60 minutes, skeet-skeet, I did it and she sip it\nMan poppa told me, \u201cDon't loose your cool, give niggas at least three warnings\u201d\nSo, I'ma kill your ass\nAnd I'ma kill your ass\nAnd I'ma kill your ass with these joints\nEvery letter I execute is a shot with a metal right to your block, I got a Glock for a larynx\nEvery rapper that hears me don't wanna say that they fear me, but let loose whenever they get a glance\nEvery since I was little I knew I was a nigga cause I fell slave to my own damn parents\nAnd I still go to church to avoid getting hurt by the devil, no God damn chance\n\n[Bridge: Nasty_C]\nHallelujah (Amen)\nI'm tryna hold on to my soul (uh-huh)\nBut the devil tells me if I let him on it I'll blow\nSays he knows I long for gold and I don't wanna die old\nBut I'd rather say no, let my cojones hang low, nigga\n\n[Verse 4: Nasty C]\nAnd I will blow\nI'm destined to shine, yet the best is confined, so chill bro\nI kill flows\nI see no evil, I'm rolling with Cain and we kill shows\nAnd we will show, colder than real snow\nI'm ill yo, I'm chilled, no\nI'm on fire, but I will not stop, nor drop, but I will roll\n\n[Hook: Nasty C]\nHallelujah\nI woke up feeling large\nI woke up, wrote bars I was feeling like Nas\nI woke up, said \u201cNah, fuck the law, I'm finna roll one, take charge\u201d\nI woke up feeling big\nI woke up in the crib, I was feeling like Pac\nDon't you ever get it twisted, I paint the picture vivid, It's my life to live so just watch and get used to it\n(I do this shit)\nNigga get used to me (I'm not new and shit)\nNigga I used to be (on some foolish shit)\nNow I just do this shit (like its a movie, bitch)\nNigga get used to it (I do this shit)\nNigga you're puke to me (who the fuck are you and shit?)\nNigga get used to me (I'm not new and shit)\nNow I just do this shit (I do this shit)\nHallelujah\n\n[Outro]\nUh-huh\nYessur\nUh-huh\nYessur, yessur"}], "artist": "Nasty C"}
