Want to toe-tag?\nI shake piss in your face but I ain\u2019t shaking your hand\nAnd I won\u2019t support you, so I\u2019m making a band\nIt\u2019s getting in here (Yeah!).  I\u2019m taking your fans\nGet your feet above my clan and I\u2019m breaking your handstands\nYou want cock.  You don\u2019t want to bust your Glock\nYour gun don\u2019t work.  Your consortium is anti-pop\nIn the hood, I got clout with killers.  No doubt\nBefore I\u2019m out, let me shout, \u201cMy niggas\u201d\nMove-ment\n\n[Verse 2: 4th Pyramid]\nBig talk mean that you little shit riddles\nSpit, fiddle with flow type ridiculous\nNo hype, meticulous.  Hold mic for Pyramids\nForget the clout and fame\nNeed some dough.  Give me that and I\u2019m out the game\nNot out to claim.  Well, hell, it\u2019s the joint, kid\nOut to sell well but I\u2019m self-appointed\nSo hot, left the kettle boiling\nInternet addict intercept bad shit\nInnocent madness.  Magnificent bastards\nDelivering rapper, limerick splatter\nLiving in chapter of serum and dagger\nFans cheering the batter, freedom from stature\nMeaningless actors, I will pee on your mattress\nBeat, I\u2019ve been mean in the madness, just too busy\nMeeting these rap kids, fleeing arachnids\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nYou in hot water now, pasta boy.  Watch the void\nMy Leonard Nimoy thugs Spock your voice\nStop the noise, stop your noise.  What?  I\u2019m Def\nJux to the illest manifestation of fresh\nYes, yes, I\u2019m blessed with the rhythm of rebels\nFor sixteen bars, the god get gold medals\nFo sho, we got spare ass-whippings, spare flows\nSpear thrown through his chest.  Now George Bush is soaked\nOh!  Oh!  Man, don\u2019t you know I\u2019m grown?\nMy special blends in the cut.  The gems\u2019ll get cloned\nI write essays, smash when my Brothers Slide\nYou ain\u2019t peace, partner.  Why you thinking otherwise?\nMy up-north Cannibal niggas stay Oxing\nFuck you up in a shower, call it, \u201cRoller-Derby Boxing\u201d\nMake long stories shorter than cheeba tales and midget reporters\nWhen I flow, I\u2019ll keep my head above water\n\n[Verse 4: 4th Pyramid]\nFlows track to the beat, goes back to the deep\nEssence of percussion.  Go back to sleep\nMind free from worry.  Need to let out more steam\nSeems that I\u2019m blurry in a holographic state\nHolographic raves follow massive blades\nGot to stash the pain.  A lot of rappers claim\nTeardrops splash and rain.  Ayyo, hold up...\nThe fax just rang\nI got to make a move soon.  Money, pass the gin\nLaugh within.  Really, I don\u2019t have to grin\nProtect your skin.  You Earl Grey?  I\u2019m peppermint\nIf it\u2019s the end of the day, let\u2019s begin\nI\u2019m granny, knitted you an amateur sweater\nHer pain guy telling you my manager\u2019s better\nIt\u2019s 4th P on the damage vendetta\nMad \u2018cause you hot, but I\u2019m brandishing leathers\n\n[Verse 5: C-Rayz Walz and 4th Pyramid]\n[C-Rayz Walz]\nSpicy swirl girls twirl and scratch nuts\nWhile I\u2019m in the White House with a black tux\nForce you to be mute when I step values\n\u2018Cause most of y\u2019all already dropped a wack album\n[4th Pyramid]\nPeruvian poon-poon knocking on my windowsill\nShe\u2019s a nympho.  Still, we going in for a kill\nCome on, nigga, we don\u2019t live a lil\nAnd make the river still, plus the Sun black\nAnd, at that point, ask, \u201cWhere your guns at?\u201d\nAt that point, ask, \u201cWhere your guns at?\u201d\nWhat?\n\n[Outro: C-Rayz Walz and (4th Pyramid)]\nWhere your guns at?  Where your guns at?  You got no shells.  (And that\u2019s it right there).  Aight"}]}
