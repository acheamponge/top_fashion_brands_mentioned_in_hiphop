I thought so, I can see the lust\nYou want me to go on, my rhyme just flow on\nThe only time I pause is for my deejay to throw on\nAnother hit, a little harder and louder\nWhen I drop the mic they come up and say how the\nHell I keep the pace with the serious face\nSteal the crowd like a crocodile, leavin a trace\nBecause I diss hard and I don't miss\nBut even if I did, I just hit em with this\n\n1, 2 and freeze, don't nobody move\nI got a score to settle and my revenge is the groove\nWe can do this, we can, look out, I'm gonna pick off\nI'm called the Gangstress, now here's the kick-off\nCrisp and clean, my rhymes keep rollin\nFreeze, don't shoot the breeze, I'm gonna keep goin\nBrowsin through the stack, pull a rhyme off the rack\nThen pump it up loud so I can feel the trap\nNow check the level, the meter, the bass and the teeter\nYour mark, you're set, hold up, this is what you need-a\nSomeone like me to lead just like a leader\nI'm like the Book Of Life and I hope you're good readers\nTurn the page, mademoiselles on stage\nAnd that's French for those of you who left the brain in the cage\nJust open your eyes, take a good look and\nThe voice, the rhyme, the beat, it's just hookin\nYeah, cause I'm hype and I'ma raise your temp\nGet off the wall, don't stall, ain't nobody exempt\nWhen I say raise your temp I mean spiritual liftin\nRun with the rhythm, I can tell if you're listenin\nBut if you're not and you try to resist\nLights out, call it a day, I'ma hit you with this\n\nI was born to have it good, I keep it in check\nKick the weak out of my path who don't come correct\nI never front in front of ducks, I got ( ? ) to hold\nJust cut em down to size should they try to get bold\nI cold blast one and I mass one\nThey won't be comin back cause they'll remember the last one\nI do it hard, the harder it got\nStick my name in their hearts, they forget me not\nNot forever, whenever you can give em a quiz\nWho's in control? They know who it is\nSpell it out at full, keep their heads down low\nGive me a mic and history is made at my show\nI'm on point, I'm like a knife when it's sharp and new\nGo 'head and beef, chief, and I'll cut right through\nNow put your tongue back in your mouth, stop breathin so loud\nThis is my mic, my rhyme, my beat and my crowd\nYou want a piece of it, you think you got what it takes?\nI mean line for line without a word bein fake\nEvery rhyme able to flex, plex and vex\nNow stop and think: Is she right? You know I'm correct\nBecause I diss hard and I don't miss\nBut even if I did, I just hit em with this", "year": "1988-01-01"}]}
