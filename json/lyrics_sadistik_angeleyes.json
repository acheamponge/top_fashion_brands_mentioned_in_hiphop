When I'm soundin' intense\nI feel like 'Pac on his hospital bed, countin' his breaths\nAnd they still say, Ill never blow on the mic\nUnless I spit a gimmick with some clever jokes cus I'm white\nIm forced to listen to critics just chatter they teeth\nWith all their bullshit opinions like it matters to me\nAnd my closest friends stumble as they mumble and doubt me\nWhile I try to hold the world as it crumbles around me\nFeel my lungs close, strain harder for breaths\nAs the broken dreams I have match the heart in my chest\nAnd the pressure builds But without a release\nI know that ya hope floats, but its out of my reach\nI'm tired of the masks that we wear (if only)\nYou saw my true self you'd be scared (to know me)\nBut now I finally see what I love is worthless\nBeauty's skin deep, but its just a surface\nMy shoulders are breaking and my focus is hazy\nPlus my teeth are chipped from biting all the bullets that you gave me\nIn the form of lies, and I mistook it as honest\nTook the good with the losses, til the good was just lost, its\nHard to hold the burdens until my shoulders bleed\nI was forced to flee, until I learned to fly with broken wings\nAcross the visions of feelin's and all this violent livin'\nOf a fucked up system insistin' that I should try to fit in\nBut now I can see I'm unrelated to you\nCus I took off the mask that suffocated the truth\n(If Life) could even worsen, (Then Id) release my burden\n(And try) to be the person, (Who writes) and speaks in perfect\n(Advice) for people hurtin', (Who cries) and fiends for nursing\n(And time) would be asserted, (To find) a decent purpose\n(But I) am weak and burdened, (I cry) and seek alertness\n(In life) to be the person, (Who's lines) are seen as perfect\n(I try) and seem so nervous, (That life) has demons lurkin'\n(That I) defeat the purpose, (And Life) is seen as worthless\n\nWatch everyday just pass me by\nSlowly corroding and acting fine\nSuffocating on this mask of mine\nTil I run out of breath and I can't survive\nRepeat x2\n\nThrough my angel eyes I see the devil's truth\nThrough my angel eyes I see the devil's truth\nThrough my angel eyes I see the devil's truth\nThrough my angel eyes I see\n(Repeat x 4)\n\nI need to get a piece of inhibition (First!)\nAnd speak another piece of bitter vision (Words!)\nAnd get a better syndicate of vindicated few\nAnd I better never let another mitigate the truth\nCus I'm the better, never get a flow with flaw\nBetter with the letters, veteran know it all\nTalk a lot in a song, better hold em off\nI thought I was lost, never fold or fall\nIf I could ever get a minute trying to be\nMy life independent when I'm dying in peace\nI might get a sentiment I write to a beat\nMy mind of a veteran, trying to see\nThat life's beautiful, suitable to let go\nOf anything and Ill just survive through it all\nInner lines intertwined, my mind is livin' life\nGrippin' mics, livin' life in trife its live and die", "album": "The Balancing Act"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
