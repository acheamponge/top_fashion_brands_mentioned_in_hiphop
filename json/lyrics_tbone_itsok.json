It's like we got a sick disease\nThat makes us, pack a piece, in these cold heart streets\nGotta break the generational curse\nHurts to see these young brothers getting hauled off in a hearse\nWhat's worse, we promote it though songs and movies\nWe banned the Passion of the Christ, but endorse Glocks and Uzis\nThen we wonder why are kids is dying, bullets flying\nGangsta's riding and gangs multiplying\nAt such fast rapid rate\nCould it be all the heroes man kind create?\nWe teach our children how to murder in these video games\nSo all they do is imitate what's inside of their brains\n'Cause to them all of the killing is cool\nSo they pack in the backpacks then shoot up the school\nAnd then leave them other children wounded and dead\nThen realize what they did and turn the gun to they head\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nRaised in a dangerous place where thugs pack heat, creep\nThrow up 'em blue flags, C-walk to the beat\nBlast from the jeep and leave you in the back of your seat\nFace down in a pool of blood resting in peace\nMark of the beast is plotting trying to leave us deceased\nBullets flying throughout our neighborhoods roaming the streets\nIt's a war zone where we living, partners dying\nAnd got collect calls from tha prison twice a day\nInside the land of the murderers, crooks and armed burglars\nPimps, and curb servers, and golden state warriors\nThat say you gotta be ready to die, you gotta decide\nCould be facing 20 to life\nIn a 6 by 9 cell, in jail wit no bail\nJust waiting to get mail where destiny is hell\nYou shoulda known gangstas never retire\nIt's blood, blood out, homie, devil's a liar\n\n[Chorus] (x2)"}], "artist": "T-Bone"}
