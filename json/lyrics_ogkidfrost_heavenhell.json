Freezes Over", "lyrics": "Verse 1:\nBe real with yourself\nMake sure that you know\nWhere you gonna go\nAt the end of the show\nWhen the credits start to roll\nWhen the lights go out\nWhen you laid up on the slab\nIs what I'm talking about\nThere ain't no prejudice with God\nIf you white or black\nYou may walk on your feet\nBut you leave on your back\nIt isn't court\nSo the judge ain't cuttin no slack\nNo when you leave the physical\nThere ain't no coming back\nDid you jack alot of people?\nDid you mess with hoes?\nDid you put that white stuff up your nose?\nNow I ain't one to judge\nSo I ain't judging anybody\nAll I know that I'ma be at ease\nWhen I leave this part\nSo think about your life\nAnd make changes\nOr maybe you straight\nAnd got a ticket to that pearly gate\nYou see if you be non-believing\nThen I say oh well but guaranteed\nThat you be leaving to a Heaven or Hell\n\nChorus:\nEverybody got to die someday\nEverybody gonna cry someday\nEverybody find a better way\nSo you know\nWhere you gonna go\nEverybody got to die someday\nEverybody gonna cry someday\nEverybody find a better way\nSo you know\nWhere you gonna go\n\nVerse 2:\nLast night while I was dreaming\nI had a talk with Eazy\nAnd believe me\nHe was real glad to see me\nWhere you been little homie?\nAnd why'd you have to die?\nI been shootin' dice\nAt that craps table in the sky\nHe said how are things goin' at the G spot?\nTony still gamblin\nJulio slamin\nAin't nothing changin' but the zeros\nKeep it up foo\nYou be some mexican heroes\nBut as I spoke to him more\nStart to burn\nThere was change in his voice\nI heard the sound of concern\nThe last time I seen him\nWas the house of blues\nHe said gamble with your life\nAnd you bound to lose Frost\nI thought about the words he spoke\nWhen they put you in the ground\nHe said everybody's broke\nI gotta shake the spot\nCause it's time to bail\nWell tell everybody\nThere's a Heaven & Hell\n\nChorus:\nEverybody got to die someday\nEverybody gonna cry someday\nEverybody find a better way\nSo you know\nWhere you gonna go\nEverybody got to die someday\nEverybody gonna cry someday\nEverybody find a better way\nSo you know\nWhere you gonna go\n\nVerse 3:\nNow Everybody's Asking\nWho Shot 2Pac?\nThe Playa Fell Victim To Whose Glock?\nA Question I Would Ask\nBut The Homie Ain't Around\nCause Somebody Put Him\n6 Ft. In The Ground\nNow Is There A Place For Dope Dealers In The Sky?\nIs There Room For Cold Killers Who Drive-by\nNow Here I Go Again\nI Think I'm Dreaming\nI Seen It\nIn A Smoke Filled Room\nWith Ashes & Demons\n2Pac Was Struggling To Stay Alive\nHe Was A Playa For Life\nBut He Was Buried At 25\nAnd If He Was Here\nThen He Could Make It Clear\nThat Your Soul Don't Float Around\nIn The Atmosphere\nBecause It's Got A Destination\nAnd God Is Who You're Facing\nAnd If You Mess Up\nThen Have A Good Explanation\nIf He Could Speak\nHe'd Have A Story To Tell\nEverybody Is Going To A Heaven or Hell\n\nOutro:\nEverybody\nEverybody got to die someday\nGonna cry someday\nEverybody\nEverybody got to die someday\nGonna cry someday"}]}
