Who am I to blame? No\nAnd I cannot be changed, I cannot be changed, no, trust me, I've tried\nI just end up right at the start of the line, drawin' circles, mhm\nI drank my whiskey, you sip your wine\nWe're doing well, sittin' watchin' the world fallin' down it's decline\nI can keep you safe, I can keep you safe\nDo not be afraid, do not be afraid\nYou're feeling sorry, I'm feeling fine\nDon't you put any more stress on yourself, it's one day at a time\nIt's gettin' pretty late, gettin' pretty late and that's fine\nIt goes around like the hands that keep countin' the time, drawin' circles", "year": null, "album": null, "title": "Circles"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
