It doesn't\n\nI'll never shatter this honey\nNever running away\nCause when the calendar says I have to, I ache\nOur close proximity\nAlways tripping over you and always banging into things\n\nYour rhythm isn't totally in sync with me\nBut I want to be a measure of your symphony\nAnd I get flustered\nIt isn't always so clear\n\nWhen I must be\nAway from you send a kiss and wait right here\n\nLive your life when I'm gone\nWe can dance all night when I get home\nLalalalalala, lalalalala\nLalalalala, lala\n(2x)\n\nI make a lot of messes\nBut you're still the plus one on my guest list\nForever 21 like my dress is\nEven when I get a little restless\n\nMe and you is what the best is\nAll the far away is just a test\nKiss me\nThrough the phone leave me breathless\nKiss me through the phone and leave me breathless\n\nIt's just fine\nCause even when I'm seeing red I'll leave and then I'll be right back\nCause sometimes I need it for a reason my career and shit\nIt be like that\n\nIt's alright\nAll the feet and miles in between is only brief I know\nJust one flight\nAnd then you're at the end and I won't spend another night alone\n\nOur close\nProximity\nAlways tripping over you and always banging into things\n\nYour rhythm isn't totally in sync with me\nBut I want to be a measure of your symphony\nAnd I get flustered\nCause it isn't always so clear\n\nWhen I must be\nAway from you send a kiss and wait right here\n\nI never get bored of brainstorming reasons I adore you (2x)\n\nLive your life when I'm gone\nWe can dance all night when I get home\nLalalalalala, lalalalala\nLalalalalalala\n(2x)\n\nSorry for the glitter when I spill it on your pillowcase\nAnd my little face is plain as vanilla tastes\nLooking better with your killer gaze\nAnd you're cool as MJ in his Thriller days\n\nSorry I'm sensitive it's\nPart of what my method is\nAnd I\nJust want you to send a kiss to me\nJust send a kiss\n\nI nibble on your lip\nI took the liberty of scribbling on bricks in Brooklyn\nEvery bathroom stall, and math book all the wrath\nI'm crawling back from\n\nYou're good at what you do\nYou take the mundane shit\nMake it all new\nUnique New York\nAll weekend\nAll the creaking\nDoors, the sneaking\nYou're my freak\n\nLive your life when I'm gone\nWe can dance all night when I get home\nLalalalalala, lalalalala\nLalalalalalala\n(2x)"}]}
