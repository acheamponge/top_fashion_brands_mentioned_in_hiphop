The lines got sharper\nYou must've been in class moving arms like an author\nNah, just been bothered, others far from mars\nCause yet they flaws they constants and they first to converse\nWith A&Rs but my bars with stars they bars is starved they bosses is off the yard\nThey far from caught, I beat em up 1,2,3\nThere goes the champ next to camp full of fake MCs\nThey basically awaiting me and vacancy no latency\nBut lately been making cheese\n\n\n[Song 2: M.I.C]\n\n[Verse 1]\nLook who's on the tracklist rolling, no reviver\nTryna get high, the cypher was my lighter\nRappers try to keep their head above water\nI slaughter,any nigga rapping with my offer\nI caught ya, slippin, now ya corpse is missing\nMy thoughts are glistened, there's never no remorse when spittin'\nI'm awesome with it, torturing all the competition\nThe odds of dissing are lower than I thought\nNo kidding, it's awkward fitting, in  with the crowd around ya\nThings are bound to hound ya, ya mans will clown ya\nDon't understand, they drown ya, I'mma stand it out\nBut you bout to go from stands to stans I doubt ya\nNow I'm taking the game over too easy\nThey need me, others see me they get queasy\nBelieve me your flows are greasy, I'm getting greedy\nI'm throwing all these rappers out can somebody feed me?\nIt's too easy, believe me"}], "artist": "Bishop Nehru"}
