Why you trying to impress a bitch?\nThe streets' opinion matter, that's why I'm on G shit\nMy name is all I got, I'm willing to die for that shit\nI won't change for nothing, what you see is what you get\nA real nigga and a fuck nigga is something that don't mix\nI got my own cash, never been a \"yes man\"\nThe few real niggas in the streets left, I'm your biggest fan\n\n[Chorus]", "year": "2005-03-01"}]}
