I don't even know it\nMust be fate cause I'm still here, no wheelchair but I'm rolling\nGot nightmares of Kanye walking on stage stealing my moment\nI'm blowin purp and I'm pourin purp and I'm poppin percs and I'm zonin\nI'm Kidd Kidd from Mazant, downtown 9th Ward New Orleans, hah\nNigga, yeah\nYeah that nigga foolie and he know it"}]}
