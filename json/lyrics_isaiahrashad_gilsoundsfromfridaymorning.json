Would you die for freedom?\nGot a ski mask on and a pistol loaded\nHear money talking, I die to meet 'em\nLooking forward to the bright lights\nLate nights and the bullshit\nYeah, they was talking that good shit\nThat's far as they could get, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c7cea3b4e8e2ba385a1b2d5258952e1b.630x630x1.jpg", "album": "Welcome to the Game", "year": "2012-12-11"}]}
