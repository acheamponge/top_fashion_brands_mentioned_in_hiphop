GET OVER\nSlow ya rota, I got it sewed up like a tailor\nRelatively easy like Jerry Heller\nCream is cherry vanilla got chicks in the telly\nBelly up, soundin' like Mahalia tryin' to tell y'all\nY'all know the style, burn the town down\nAnd change the locale, I'm doin the same shit 'cept its legit\nIt's Jigga\n\n[Chorus: Boo]\nGot a twenty cart shorty better play that shit\nYou owe me twenty baby better pay that shit\nGot twenty bag son better blaze that shit\nThey said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit\nGot a twenty cart shorty better play that shit\nYou owe me twenty baby better pay that shit\nGot twenty bag son better blaze that shit\nThey said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit\n\n[Verse 2: Gotti]\nPimp Gotti get the dues in them double down\nLike them kids with tips who tops down\nBricks who get money quick see me\nRepresentin' bomb city on the bill block rockin' mics\nBefore they get a mil', I sold pills all night\nThe illest outta life got my mind on fate\n'Cause even on tour nigga still ain't safe\nI keep a tre eight on my left\nSmoke a L for stress countin' dirt bag lex\nI be the, X like Malcolm\nPuff for now dunn east side represent with tons of guns\nYou keep it real where you from\n'Cause where you at might put the dagger in yo' back\nIt's like livin' with yo homie that be on crack\nIn fact my niggas know my style's phat like hoes in the El Dorado\nMy mind totin', fuck 'em, duck 'em\nAny thing but the main gun I don't trust 'em\n\n[Chorus: Boo]\nGot a twenty cart shorty better play that shit\nYou owe me twenty baby better pay that shit\nGot twenty bag son better blaze that shit\nThey said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit\nGot a twenty cart shorty better play that shit\nYou owe me twenty baby better pay that shit\nGot twenty bag son better blaze that shit\nThey said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit\n\n[Verse 3: Boo]\nCool with the nigga huh, fro main chilla\nBerg shit, word shit, I splurge with scrilla\nObserve when you work spit bird shit killer\nNot to be perturbed with, herb shit dealer\nCan make me feel y'all fo' real ya tock tickin'\nBust a rapper bust a cap hustler stop flinchin'\nYou fresh off the corner calling dog shit brog shit\nSoon as you feel that sog shit you be like oh shit (stoooooop)\nBroke niggas resort the glass lookin'\nOpposite the track ass whoopin'\nOpposite the black class hooker the fat ass fooker\nTriple your cash criple your stash pass shooker\nThe past ain't never the last to teach lessons\nMy peeps fuckin' up in the streets keep guessin'\nBrew don't becomin' a preach I be blessin'\nLot of kids comin' out the wrong way like C-sections\nKnow the bro gone flow even if it cross shorts\nFuck weed cop coke 'cause the shit cost more\nBut niggas say I floss to much\nBut when I take it off and such they say I lost my touch\nThose bitches like the money I wear\nWhat its funny how they stare\nDumb bunnies with they cunnin' little glare\nShorty let me see the tail if its really that shittin'\nShe hit me with a felion a young pair kitten\nMy boy hit that shit now every body smitten\nEven holdin snow balls and I ain't talkin 'bout mittens\nWhat I talkin 'bout mittens, fo' real\n\n[Chorus: Boo]\nGot a twenty cart shorty better play that shit\nYou owe me twenty baby better pay that shit\nGot twenty bag son better blaze that shit\nThey said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit\nGot a twenty cart shorty better play that shit\nYou owe me twenty baby better pay that shit\nGot twenty bag son better blaze that shit\nThey said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit", "title": "20 Bag Shorty", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf0f68ee56f29c8542ad805c6419682b.676x676x1.jpg", "year": null, "album": "The Projects Presents: Balhers Forever"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
