Tell me the plan\nIs it Christian rap music for Christian rap fans?\nI make songs for the broken if the shoe fits wear it\nFor those who could never measure up by their merits\nFor bad kids in a mad city who never had parents\nFor those who never pray but say they're praying for Paris\nThese are pearls for perilous times, why waste it\nI feel the weight of the world but I'm weightless\nOuter space all my burdens were lifted\nAnd I confirm this by living with the firmest convictions, hah\nI was born in the 503, hip-hop junky my heroes were emcees\nMy heart was cold sub-zero degrees\nBut God showed mercy to a zero like me\nAmputate my legs and I'll still walk with Jesus\nWhen I say my last words, I will talk about Jesus\n\n(Chorus)\nCome, all you who want rest\nCome, all who search for truth\nCome come, all who ran in vain and found dust\nCome, you who have been untrue\nCome, all who need His grace\n\n(Verse 2)\nAnd I boldly proclaim that it's only by grace\nThat sinners become saints, holy and saved\nI know what I say won't be fully embraced\nI stay fully engaged spilling rhymes on the page not\nAiming for fame, I don't got the strength\nI dedicate this to the blind, poor, crippled and lame\nSimple and plain, an invitation to the banquet it's a heavenly feast\nAnd the end of all anguish\nThe language I speak when my pen bleeds\nCan't leave rap alone, I know who the game needs\nI can't promise you a pain free existence\nI point you to a permanent hope off in the distance\nThis is my blood, and this is my body\nThrough faith in Christ the wicked become godly\nThe healthy, don't need a doctor the sick do\nAnd It's obvious we got a lot of issues\nBow down, for the King's arrival\nThe Kingdom of God is no place for the prideful\n\n(Chorus)\nCome, all you who want rest\nCome, all who thirst for truth\nCome come, all who ran in vain and found dust\nCome, you who have been untrue\nCome, all who need His grace\nCome\n\n(outro)", "year": "2018-05-18", "album": "B8*"}], "artist": "Braille"}
