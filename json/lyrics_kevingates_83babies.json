1: Kevin Gates]\nI met a bitch from Mayag\u00fcez, now we Puerto Rico Gang\nMy Ahkna saying he worried about me\nBut I got a lion, I don't got to kill\nConcrete jungle, heart of a tiger\nI got it from his, so go help out the bear\nI ate from the shoulders, I got a pair\nKevin a soldier, fully prepared\nI'm in the Rover, I got that cash\nWhen it gets slow, I go in the stash\nTell me it's on, then I'm on your ass\nYou come at me wrong, I take out the trash\nLandlord, it ain't no discussion\nYou thinking I'm bluffin', I'm doin' the dash\nGot me some money, recruited some dummies, know how to do nothin' but show up and crash\n\n[Chorus: Setitoff83]\nIt ain't no cap in my rap, I really sit in the trap\nI'm really servin' them packs, I'm really movin' like that\nIt ain't no cap in my rap, young nigga run up them racks\nAnd no we don't fuck with no rats\nSo why would we fuck with them cats?\nIt ain't no cap in my rap, I really sit in the trap\nI'm really servin' them packs, I'm really movin' like that\nIt ain't no cap in my rap, young nigga run up them racks\nAnd no we don't fuck with no rats\nSo why would we fuck with them cats?\n\n[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]\nI met a bitch from Mayag\u00fcez, now we Puerto Rico Gang\nI said I'm arrogant as hell, but I can order up them things\nYellow bitch, ass fat, black bitch, ass fatter\nBoth them bitches bad, but the white bitch badder\nI asked the Lord to harden my hard, it was soft, and ended up turning it black\nIt's up on my end, I'm droppin' a bag, you play with the kid, I'm catchin' a hat\nI meditated, then elevated to greatness, then I went got me a sack\nStraight out the hood, got me some class, selling them squares, controlling the trap\n\n[Chorus: Setitoff83]\nIt ain't no cap in my rap, I really sit in the trap\nI'm really servin' them packs, I'm really movin' like that\nIt ain't no cap in my rap, young nigga run up them racks\nAnd no we don't fuck with no rats\nSo why would we fuck with them cats?\nIt ain't no cap in my rap, I really sit in the trap\nI'm really servin' them packs, I'm really movin' like that\nIt ain't no cap in my rap, young nigga run up them racks\nAnd no we don't fuck with no rats\nSo why would we fuck with them cats?\n\n[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]\nHe make 'em believe, they cut up with cutters, no raking the leaves after mowing the grass\nMade some mistakes, I was lame, but I got me some game, evolving and now I'm advanced\nTalking real slick on a hitter, in case you won't listen, ain't no one accepting the past\nYour bitch need to get out her feelings, won't take her to dinner, I got a lil' something to go grab\nGet in my business, get placed on restriction, won't give her no dick for a month and a half\nNeighborhood supplier, I [?], I'ma control it, it's on the way back\nPullin' that dope while I pour in a soda, we smoking that odor, we blow in the air\nKinda excited, she suckin' my dick while I'm driving, I'm blowin' the smoke in her hair\nLook I got a question-\nNot tryna come like off I'm thinking impaired\nCould you give a definitive reason of what you was meaning by \"blowing the smoke in hair\"\nReally be blowin' the smoke in her hair, cause her head down there\nI lick on the tip of my finger, look how it so easily go in the hole of her ass\nKnow when you deal with a dealer, I feel you pretending, and you got potential to rat\nYou could be up for a minute, then shit could get wicked, so you need to know how to stack\nI know it's best to be humble, but come at this grown one in public, then I gotta slam\nReading a book in Barnes & Noble's, having some coffee, enjoying the moment\nTattoo session, blockin' my schedule, checkin' my calendar if I'm performing\nNebraska calling, I'm with it, I step in the kitchen and give 'em a perfect performance\nDepends what you spending, I lower the ticket, the issue delivered if you could afford it\nWe had to trap out the trenches, they come and come get it, we no longer stand on the corners\nBustin' a brick in the clench and I'm still with the shit, if you want, I'm pullin' up on you\nTell my Lieutenant to send it from Summer to Winter, you catch a lil' more in the morning\nAye, excuse me, I need to speak with my Generals\nWith all due respect, ain't gon' be no killing without no killing\n\n[Bridge: Kevin Gates]\nI met a bitch from Mayag\u00fcez, now we Puerto Rico Gang\nSaid I'm arrogant as hell, but I can order up them things\nYellow bitch, ass fat, black bitch, ass fatter\nBoth them bitches, but the white bitch badder\nYellow bitch, ass fat, black bitch, ass fatter\nBoth them bitches, but the white bitch badder\nI met from Mayag\u00fcez, now we Puerto Rico Gang\nSaid I'm arrogant as hell, but I can order up them things\nI asked the Lord to harden my hard, it was soft, and ended up turning it black\nIt's up on my end, I'm droppin' a bag, you play with the kid, I'm catchin' a hat\nI meditated, then elevated to greatness, then I went got me a sack\nStraight out the hood, got me some class, selling them squares, controlling the trap\n\n[Outro: Kevin gates]\nI met a bitch from Mayag\u00fcez, now we Puerto Rico Gang\nI met a bitch from Mayag\u00fcez, now we Puerto Rico Gang\nI met a bitch from Mayag\u00fcez, now we Puerto Rico Gang\nI met a bitch from Mayag\u00fcez, now we Puerto Rico Gang"}], "artist": "Kevin Gates"}
