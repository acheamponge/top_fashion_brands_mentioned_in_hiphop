You hear that there\nI make it where these mothafuckas feel that there\nWhen the rims too big and the road ain't shit\nIt make it hard to steer that there\nBut it's big bank, big bank, big bank, big bank, one time\nI wake up, cake up, cake up, then press, rewind\n\n[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]\nI got big bank flexing on a mothafucka\nAin't shit changed cause I'm still getting, still mine\nAin't no love for a hater try'na block me, tryna play me\nMothafuckas never stop my, stop shine\nYeah they see me but they still watching\nI got shinin' on re-run (On re-run) I got shinin' on re-run\nYeah they see me but they still watching\nI got shinin' on re-run (On re-run) I got shinin' on re-run\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nBig bank, currency, and revenue\nGetting to it, all a nigga ever do\nAnd all I care about is how to get it, no doubt\nBig numbers in front of my decimal, check it\nMake sure it's multiplying\nIs all I'm ever I worried about\nAnd slow money beat no money\nWhat the fuck you in a hurry 'bout?\nNigga, I'm saying, mm\nStay getting to it that broke shit ain't in my plan, yeah\nSleep when I'm dead, I'ma grind every day that I can\nGot seven kids, and I gotta make sure\nAll of 'em them fed, by any means\nCan't be no excuses, my children can't eat no excuses\nMy daughter can't sleep in excuses\nMy son he see me with no paper like keep your excuses\nIf you ain't producing, you're useless\nThat's why I'm out here getting to it\nFresh out the booth, I go straight to the stage\nThen I go straight to get paid\nHunnid' I earned, fifty I saved\nMy bitch don't be cleaning up, I need a maid\nShe don't be cooking so I need a chef\nAin't giving me nothin', I get it myself\nI'm doing my thing and I did it to death\nStacking them chips, getting that dough\nMillions, need me a couple hundo\nBig mansion with a double front do'\nPretty young thang in a new condo\nPray to God I could stay rich and stay humble\n\n[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]\nI got big bank flexing on a mothafucka\nAin't shit changed cause I'm still getting, still mine\nAin't no love for a hater try'na block me, tryna play me\nMothafuckas never stop my, stop shine\nYeah they see me but they still watching\nI got shinin' on re-run (On re-run) I got shinin' on re-run\nYeah they see me but they still watching\nI got shinin' on re-run (On re-run) I got shinin' on re-run\n\n[Outro: Mannie Fresh]\nEarthlings and aliens, gather around, come close\nWhile I tell you the story of fine ass Denise\nAnd the 4 15s in a Caprice\nHitting hard like a disrespectful step-daddy\nThe thunder god coming up the block\nGoing subbing is a way of life\nHugged up with yo' baby mama or your wife\nRide on, sub on"}], "artist": "Big K.R.I.T."}
