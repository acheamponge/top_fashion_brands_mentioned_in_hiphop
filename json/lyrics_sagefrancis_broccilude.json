I'm simply amazed.. as a housewife right now\n\n\n[Man's voice]\nWhy don't you serve this to president George Bush? You know, he once told the press that he wasn't too crazy about broccoli, and it actually made the news!\n\n[Woman's voice]\nI never imagined broccoli can be put together with something sweet like\nThis, and the yogurt is not so overpowering either\n\n[Man's voice]\nI think he went to the extent of being a, well you could say, evangelist of\nBroccoli, like an ambassador of sorts.
