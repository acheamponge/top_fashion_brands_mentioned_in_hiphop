I know you feel me, right?\nI know you feel me right, uh\n\n[Hook]\nAt times I get too drunk to fuck, too high to deal with shit\nI might just spend a hundred at the dealership\nEven my haters gotta feel this shit\nEnjoy the show, bitch you could suck my dick\nYou and you, you could suck my dick\nAnd you, uh", "title": "Dealer Plates", "album": "Rogues Vol. 2 ", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ccb4b913da0f3aa784d0bd9ac043bfbc.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2016-12-31"}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
