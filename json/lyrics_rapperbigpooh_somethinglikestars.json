That's a favouring\nLil' kids say we rap, then we got to bang\nThat's fucked up, kids now believe everything\nI don't work so my neighbors probably think I slang\nWhite folk only know you if you got some fame\nOr they kid's kid's kid's can recite your name\nI'm one to whisper cause I'm Craig T on the plane\nThey think I'm struggling cause they never see me with a chain\nThat's choice fam, I shouldn't have to explain\nI'm the type to take a car when niggas take trains\nI'm the type to take a boat when niggas take planes\nWhen you see me next time just expect change\nI'm going back to the range, get your head right\n\n[Hook 2X]\n\n[Rapper Big Pooh]\nI hear you talk right, but most of y'all, you don't walk like\nI guess you talk like a dog barks 'stead of bite\nWeak niggas want to shoot but they ain't tryna fight\nAll dirt get exposed in the right light\nNowadays I'm hearing people say they write like\nCan do better than this underrated veteran\nI'm thinking niggas just mad I'm ahead of them\nThis a marathon homie and I'm settled in\nYou big time or you paper-thin\nAs long as paper getting fat and I can pass to my next of kin\nI be okay how my story end\nGetting told by historians, they say that Poobie ill\nHaters underestimated the skill\nPeople can't get enough, heard they haven't been filled\nAnd I feel the truth just been sealed\nOnly time will reveal what the real niggas feel, uh\n\n[Hook 4X]"}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
