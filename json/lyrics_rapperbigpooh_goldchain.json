Here comes that rap check\nTake me to the store, I need a Rolex\nNo, take me to the car lot, I want a Lex\nDriving 'round slow, this is success\nLook at all these girls looking impressed\nYes! I'm in the money G\nNow watch them [?] no money tree\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI used to want a Rollie instead I bought a Lexus\nNow I got women rubbing on my solar plexus\nThey wanna know where that money at\nBut tell me would you love me in a Pontiac\nNow watch 'em scatter like roaches\nGot tired of dealing with them vultures\nTryna stick it up like a poster\n[Snoop?] say ain't no love for them hoes bruh\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI had to figure out who I was\nWho I ain't, I ain't in clubs\nI ain't concerned with looking nigga rich\nAll on your television looking niggerish\nRah rah, rah rah rah, rah\nOr blah blah, blah blah blah, blah\nNor always talking 'bout what I got\n'Cause I know them wolf niggas keep a plot\nThat's how you get got\nThink on it\nGold Chain bitch"}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
