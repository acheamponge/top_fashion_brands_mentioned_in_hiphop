Jackin' me up... tight me!\nStewardess: I'm sorry, I don't understand\nGuy 2: Cutty say 'e can't HANG!\nWoman: Oh stewardess! I speak jive\nStewardess: Oh good!\nWoman: He said that he's in great pain and he wants to know if you can help him\nStewardess: All right. Would you tell him to just relax and I'll be back as soon as I can with some medicine?\nWoman: Jus' hang loose, blood\n\n[Verse 1]\nCould have run to my arms, but you run to the rocks\nHow do I heal all these scars after you've taken your shots?\nAnd my faith is in my hands and my vice is on my mask\nI guess God can't understand what I've been trying to ask\nAnd now I'm losing every hand\nAnd somehow I lost my grasp\nAnd my mind's in chains and bands\nFrom memories of our past\nI guess God can't understand\nWhat I've been trying to ask\n\n[Hook x2]\nAnd he says I know, I know, I know, (I know, I know)\nI hurt you once before (before, before)\nBut I can do better (do better, do better, do better)\nPlease let me do better (better)\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf I tried to be blind\nThrough the signs I'd decide\nYou are real, you are mine\nBut I ain't blind\nI'm ain't trying for you\nBaby I resign\nAnd I'm hearing all the chimes\nI'll follow til' I find\nAnd if I had a thousand lives\nI would leave you a thousand times\nAnd my mind goes through the lines\nAnd memories of your crimes\nI ain't trying for you\nBaby I resign\n\n[Hook x2]\nAnd he says I know, I know, I know, (I know, I know)\nI hurt you once before (before, before)\nBut I can do better (do better, do better, do better)\nPlease let me do better (better)\n\n[Verse 3]\nTell myself I couldn't care less\nWhatcha doing if you're a mess?\nI ain't trying for you\nI put you to rest\nFor a reason\nStaying strong is my test\nBaby you thought you had me\nIn my way you did\nI realized you ain't shit\nNow I don't need you\nI can confess\nIt's for a reason\nThis is my test\n\n[Hook x2]\nAnd he says I know, I know, I know, (I know, I know)\nI hurt you once before (before, before)\nBut I can do better (do better, do better, do better)\nPlease let me do better (better)"}], "artist": "Kat Dahlia"}
