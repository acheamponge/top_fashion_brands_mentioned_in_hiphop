G Pen, mid-air\nHigh school I was getting high\nTeacher say I was going nowhere\nNow I'm worth millions that's the worst feeling\nSaid fuck a job bought the building\nAll these fake niggas where the real ones\nFirst-class no shoes, young nigga I got no rules\n6'1\", no roof, go hard won't lose\nAnd you know the truth, I got more to do\nAlready made history once\nFuck I'm supposed to do?\nBig bag, no seeds\nYeah I rap and I grow weed\nWhen you this great, niggas don't hate\nIt's about dollars so it can't wait\n\n[Chorus]\nKnow that shit'll get real in that city of steel\nKnow that shit'll get real in that city of steel\nKnow that shit'll get real in that city of steel\nKnow that shit'll get real in that city of steel\n\n[Verse 2]\nBreak down the gas roll another one\nPuff one J, roll my brother one\nAlready stoned and I'm almost home\nIf you high then you know where I'm coming from\nKK feel it all in my lungs, one puff damn got me going numb\nEverywhere I go niggas want some\n(Damn, man let me get some of that shit)\nNo, high all day I ain't coming down\nTake two pulls then it's going round\nSince a young nigga I been blowing pounds\nAlways in the sky I ain't on the ground\nJump in the ride about to blow a cone\nNiggas at the crib so I'm solo\nTake this half-ounce to the dome\nSmoke this hash out of the bong\nDon't choke don't pass out until the morning\nIn the club throwing cash out 'til it close\nAnd I stay with the pack on any coast\nKK cut down to a clone\nGameday touchdown Randy Moss\nSay we just ran out so we getting more\nWe gone smoke 'til we ain't got anymore\nDon't just roll one roll plenty more\n\n[Chorus]\nKnow that shit'll get real in that city of steel\nKnow that shit'll get real in that city of steel\nKnow that shit'll get real in that city of steel\nKnow that shit'll get real in that city of steel\n\n[Outro]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fcf4a167b13ca49e8ad4865ce51249a2.600x600x1.jpg", "album": "Laugh Now, Fly Later", "title": "City Of Steel"}]}
