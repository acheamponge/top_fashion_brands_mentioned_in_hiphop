Who are we?\nWho am I? Who are we?\nAll I want is to feel complete\nWho am I? Who are we?\n\n[Chorus]\nConfused, truth is what I choose\nHeal I never do\nAsking, \"Who are you?\"\nI don't have one clue\nSeems I hate him, too\nSeems my color's blue\nWho?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI always end up back in a cycle of shame\nLooking in the mirror is hard\nSome days, I hurt myself to distract me from distraction\nThat's madness fixing sadness\nGo on adventures to find that the answers aren't plain\nBut there's comfort in tears\nDecoding my sacred heart, flying from here\nNo more falling apart, ah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWho am I? Who are we?\nWho am I? Who are we?\nAll I want is to feel complete\nWho am I? Who are we?\n\n[Bridge]\nI hate the drugs, but I love the numb\nI hate the gun, but I want the sun\nI hate the drugs, but I love the numb\nI hate the gun, but I want the sun\n\n[Chorus]\nConfused, truth is what I choose (Truth is what I choose)\nHeal I never do (Heal, I never do)\nAsking, \"Who are you?\" (Asking, \"Who are you?\")\nI don't have one clue (I don't have one clue)\nSeems I hate him, too (Seems I hate him, too)\nSeems my color's blue, ooh\nWho?\n\n[Bridge]\nI hate the drugs, but I love the numb\nI hate the gun, but I want the sun\nI hate the drugs, but I love the numb\nI hate the gun, but I want the sun"}]}
