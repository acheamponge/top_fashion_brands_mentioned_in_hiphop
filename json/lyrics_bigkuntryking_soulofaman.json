I'm the realest that they close to\nLife is like a jump shot you gotta follow through\nEven if the curtains close, I will still shine through nigga\n\n[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]\nThis is all that I am, the soul of a man\nIn these streets and they keep callin' me\nAnd I can't change who I am, I just do what I can\nIn these streets but they won't get the best of me\n\n[Outro: Ricco Barrino]\nBig Kuntry King, just get money man\nJust doin' ya thang, that's the name of the game\nHey, Big Kuntry King, just get money man\nJust doin' ya thang, that's the name of the game\nBig Kuntry King"}], "artist": "Big Kuntry King"}
