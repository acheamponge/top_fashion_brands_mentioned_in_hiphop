I know that 'cause the guy kept saying it, angrily fold the passion\nAnd his name, was either Brendan or Britton\nI couldn't make it out from the table that I was sitting\nHe was saying; Aspyn, it has been months since we had sex\nAll you do is act sad, and act stressed\nAll you do is act depressed and act mopy\nI sleep next to you every night, but feel lonely\nLow-key, I think you hate me\nIf you ain't attracted to me, why the fuck did you ever choose to date me\nWhen I try to kiss you, you just push me away\nI used to have your heart, until you put it away\nDamn, I didn't know you couldn't handle this involvement\nAm I that disgusting to you, am I that repulsive?\nAll I want to do is kiss and touch, but you got cold on me, life is always tense it's rough\n\n[VERSE 3]\nAnd she said: \"Wait wait wait, it's like you never listen once\nWe used to make love, now to you I'm just a fuck\nI work all day, I get home, you don't say shit\nYou just play your stupid fucking Xbox in the basement\nYou never talk to me, never ask me how my day went\nAnd then you expect me to be turned on and get naked?\nWhat happened to the charming conversations that we used to have?\nYou used to smile at me, hold my hand, you used to grab me\nRight when I would walk in the door, and tell me I was beautiful, now we don't talk anymore\nI didn't know you couldn't handle this involvement\nAm I that disgusting to you, am I that repulsive?\n\n[HOOK]\nIf you were the couple at the Filling Station Coffee Shop on Johnson Drive in Kansas, 11:00 am on March 20th\nI'm sorry for the song I threw together\nBut I hope ya'all worked this shit out, 'cause ya'all too cute together\n\n[VERSE 4]\nAnd honestly, I'm just being objective\nBoth of you suggested you were being neglected\nBut from an outsiders perspective, both of you should take the passion that you feel and, eh, redirect it\n\n[VERSE 5]\nBrendan, Britton, whichever one your name is\nI hope that you can take advice given by a stranger\nYour girl has needs that require understanding\nShe needs to truly feel that you're her man, and companion\nTalk to her, and when she talks, listen\nFix shit around the house, pay attention\nShe needs to feel wanted way more than part of the time\nA lot of time for women, foreplay starts in the mine\n\n[VERSE 6]\nAnd Aspyn, I hope you understand, at the end of the day, your boyfriend is not a boy, he's still the fucking man\nSex to him ain't a luxury, it's a need\nA tension deep inside him that's rumbling must be freed\nHe's low on oxytocin, help him see inside the blame\nFuck, help him re\u00efgnite the flame\nI promise that that, unloving asshole will go away\nAnd that warm loving soul you crave will return\n\n[ENDING]\nI hope you both have a wonderful day", "year": "2017-03-21", "album": "YouTube", "title": "For the Couple That Was Fighting at the Coffee Shop"}], "artist": "Mac Lethal"}
