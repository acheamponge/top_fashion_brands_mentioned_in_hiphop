I'm stressed out beyond belief.\"\n\"So much weight on my chest daily, I'm missin' the streets.\"\nGot me stretched out like a pregnant lady's belly\nX-Raided is stagnated and it's drivin' me crazy\nI created this situation, I know that's the truth\nNo father figures in the ghetto, but that ain't no excuse\nMama excuse my behavior please\nFeels like my soul's gone\nPray for your only son, need to be strong\nAnd hold on\n\nChorus:\n\nHold on, never let 'em see you shed a tear\nMy soul's gone, on the inside I've been dead for years\nHold on\nMama, all my love's for you\nSo much drama in the World, what's a thug to do?\nHold on.......shed a tear\nMy soul's gone.......dead for years\n(No father figures in the ghetto but that ain't no excuse)\nHold on\nMama, all my love's for you\n(Mama excuse my behavior please, feels like my soul's gone\nPray for your only son cuz you need to be strong)\nSo much drama in the World, what's a thug to do?\nStretched out like a pregnant lady's belly\nX-Raided is stagnated and it's drivin' me crazy\nI created this situation, I know that's the truth\nNo father figures in the ghetto, but that ain't no excuse\nMama excuse my behavior please\nFeels like soul's gone\nPray for your only son, need you to be strong, and hold on"}], "artist": "X-Raided"}
