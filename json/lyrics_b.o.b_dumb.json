That's dumb\nI don't wanna go get lunch\nI'm just tryna fuck this dumb\nDumb, dumb, that's dumb\nD-U-M-B, that's dumb\n40's on a coupe that's dumb\n40 on a Rollie that's dumb\nHundred in a duffel that's dumb\nD-U-M-B, that's dumb\nThat's dumb, dumb\nThat's dumb\nDu-du-du-du-du-du-dumb\n\n[Verse 1]\nI just tell it how it come to me\nGotta make it sound fly for the dumb niggas\nSwear to god im tryna find out what they want wit me\nI guess the music in me, use it till they done wit me\nAnd when they done with me, next one\nStages of grief, you just on step one\nForest Gump with the quotes, Don Cheadle\nI'ma go teflon\nParanoid nigga sleepin with the pump\nDeep Underground Military Bases, that's dumb\nBobby on the beat, that's dumb\nI don't under sleep, that's dumb\nN-U-M-B, I'm numb\nIn the studio getting blowed\nTo the realest shit I ever wrote, wrote, wrote\nIn a world where they give you a disease\nThen sell yo ass the antidote\nThat's dumb\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's dumb\nWhy fall in love? That's dumb\nI don't wanna go get lunch\nI'm just tryna fuck this dumb\nDumb, dumb, that's dumb\nD-U-M-B, that's dumb\n40's on a coupe that's dumb\n40 on a Rollie that's dumb\nHundred in a duffel that's dumb\nD-U-M-B, that's dumb\nThat's dumb, dumb\nThat's dumb\nDu-du-du-du-du-du-dumb\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah\nWho you know realer than Bob, riddle me that\nWho you know talk this much shit on a track\nOnce you sell your soul no ain't way on getting it back\nOh you gon' have to be much quicker than that\nAsymmetrical flows and metaphysical raps\nInvoking pivotal moments, exposing criminal acts\nFor those that live in a mask, that show the critical mass\nThey tried to give me a roof but now the ceiling is cracked\nCracked, cracked, now the ceiling is cracked\nI will not fall in the mud\nI will not fall through the cracks\nI know that where we're headed is where we been in the past\nWhat happen to Sasquatch?\nWhat happen to Anthrax? (what?)\nWhere's half your advance at?\nWhat happen to loyalty, and having your man's back?\nWhere ever the red the white and the blue lands at\nWe kill the natives and never give 'em they land back\n\n\n[Chorus]\nThat's dumb\nWhy fall in love? That's dumb\nI don't wanna go get lunch\nI'm just tryna fuck this dumb\nDumb, dumb, that's dumb\nD-U-M-B, that's dumb\n40's on a coupe that's dumb\n40 on a Rollie that's dumb\nHundred in a duffel that's dumb\nD-U-M-B, that's dumb\nThat's dumb, dumb\nThat's dumb\nDu-du-du-du-du-du-dumb\n\n[Outro]\nI know when the tide is high, the tide is low\nOh, there's an eye in the sky                                                                  I know when the tide is high, the tide is low\nOh, there's an eye in the sky", "title": "DUMB", "album": "E.A.R.T.H (Educational Avatar Reality Training Habitat)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/288c59f28a4e9c1559eae1f7558abb79.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
