Lewis and Jimmy Jam on it\nYo, I bang a nigga head 'til his neck pop\nDo a KRS-One to a \"Black Cop\"\nX and Es, out for the cream\nGet the money, while you stay broker than Al Bundy\nUhh, give it to y'all, in \"Any Given Sunday\"\nWith J. Foxx name the spot, make it hot\n(I hate E so much right now)\nBlow it down hooker bounce, come off the ropes like J. Snuka\n(X: Two fly motherfuckers) You can't fuck with it\nBacked by Open Bar, so y'all forget it\n\n[Chorus: Xzibit]\nCall it what you wanna call it\nI'm a fucking Alkaholik\nBring it if you really want it\nAin't gotta put no extras on it\nCall it what you wanna call it\nI'm a fucking Alkaholik\nBring it if you really want it\nAin't gotta put no extras on it\n\n[Verse 3: J-Ro]\nJ-McEnroe, cam smashin', party crashin'\nI eat MCs like a ration\nI'm sockin' niggas in their goatees\nI leave you stiffer than that fool on my basketball trophies\nI'm in the room with 10 Gs, counting ten Gs\n'Cause we need a bag of weed (can you smell weed?)\nNow we need ten dimes, to blow on deez like wind chimes\nTime to close the blinds 'cause you all in mines\nI bought a bottle for the session, and did not share it\nDrink so much Captain Mo' all I need is a parrot\nYou took the Alkaholik challenge, and lost your balance\nYou underground, we under water drinkin' liquor by the gallons\n\n[Verse 4: Tash]\nSlurred words, double vision, brain bustin', head rushin'\nIf I'm too drunk to walk, I'll rock a party on crutches\nAnd still rush the roughest MC who wanna get it\nForget it, it's Likwit, Tha Liks and, Xzibit\nCa-Tash on the blast the final piece to the puzzle\nI slap bitches on the ass, I slap pits up out the muzzle\nI shuffle with the microphone, bang rhymes consistent\nYou wack and I'm Ca-Tash and that's the motherfuckin' difference\nFor instance, \"21 and Over\" set your clocks back (Tick-tock-tick)\nStill standin' where the rocks at\nTwo-thousand-one, we still young guns that's Restless\n(Thirty niggas, sixty hoes) and that's the motherfuckin' guest list\n\n[Chorus: Xzibit]\nCall it what you wanna call it\nI'm a fucking Alkaholik\nBring it if you really want it\nAin't gotta put no extras on it\nCall it what you wanna call it\nI'm a fucking Alkaholik\nBring it if you really want it\nAin't gotta put no extras on it"}], "artist": "Xzibit"}
