I don't give a fuck about karma\nCuz if it never comes for those who benefit from misery\nAin't no motherfucking way it could ever do shit to me\nThere's nothing metaphysically deep about getting shot\nPissing in your pants and vomiting blood on tha block\nWitness protection? Try to stay alive on the humble?\nNiggas'll hunt you down like dinosaurs, alive in the jungle\nAnd don't mumble when you try to disrespect my bars\nI'll throw a chinese nigga at you, infected with SARS\nGet banana boat niggas to murder you for a g\nGet'em a green card and getchu chopped up for free\nButchu ain't even worth having your body buried\nIf you was locked up you'd be lap dancing for commissary\nCut the commentary, motherfucker nobody cares\nYou try to go to Thugs Mansion but nobody's there\nBecause the judgement day for you is an empty place\nAnd I'm going to send you first class with a hole in your face\nI'm taking your space nigga, don't act like you know me\nCause i'll fuck your girl whether she likes it or not, like i was Kobe\nI'm Immortal Technique, nigga. You don't want to fuck with that\nI'll beat the shit outta your bitch, and take her trucker hat\nI'm still angry and bitter, got niggas laughing atchu after you die like John Ritter", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1-immortal_technique-20101005.Jpg", "album": "Portable Immortal ", "year": "2004-01-01"}]}
