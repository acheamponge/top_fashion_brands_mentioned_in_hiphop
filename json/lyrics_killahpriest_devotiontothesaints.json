That's right, I have heard you're the master of dragon's sword Right, hahaha, maybe, but try me\n\n[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]\nNY fitted, Jordan 13's on the feet\nSplash blood on my threads, how I murder the beat\nLike medicine to infants, out of they reach\nIn a charcoal seven with the chardonnay seats\nNow my name ring, I played the born, and bare the storm\nNow I made king, I weigh my arm, and they respond\nStay gone off that haze and Don, game long like\nTriple overtime, overtime stay strong\nThe great one, fake none, put it on the Bible\nSee me face to face, look me in my eyes, deuce\nSpartacus flow, soul cookies in the vinyls\nOnly time I go soft, raw pussy on the cycle\nYour highness, INS, darts catch your body\nAnd all a nigga saw was the sparks from the tommy\nPapis split the fishscale raw, copping polly\nBig brother Rollie on Deck, got it roxy\n\n[Verse 3: Killah Priest]\nMy rap is like a holy drug cart, documented in my sentence\nAround the edges, sold my presence of my life beginning\nFor born bloody swarm, early to a Godly finish\nTo naysayers throwing stones, hoping I'll diminish\nThe skies open, til I rose from three or four dimensions\nWith great rings, less then the dollars the grave bring\nMeet the afterlife, chapters I write, with great king\nA spiritual [?], hearing from beyond\nThey talk to me through a cloth coofie, Lord's beauty\nAnd I'll admit through gems of life, I lost jewelry\nAmongst the land dwellers, never trust what a man will tell ya\nThey give you stone for bread, you found dead\nWith no dog to smell ya, passing acid in your liquor glasses\nWhen they pour it, have you throwing up blood and courage\nJust a week ago, you spotted them walk in\nWith your enemy, and you recall it\nThey wasn't mean mugging, they were talking, plotting on you\nBut God made me unnormal, your diary rise\nBreathing the immortal\n\n[Outro: sample]\nIt was mean, while I'm fixing\nHis identity, overthrown by the republicans\nBut our people are still suffering, I am determined\nTo reorganize this justice, to help our people\nBy overthrowing the republicans\nSo help me to regain our position\nWe will overcome the republicans"}]}
