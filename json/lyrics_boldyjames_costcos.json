Castro, that's my Capo\nI'm the boss hog, head honcho\nBut the plug call me \"muchacho\"\nMuchacho, El Gato\nYeah, I get 'em for the deuce cuatro\nIf them bricks flaky, we'll re-rock those\nIf them O's shaky, we could swap those\nIf them bowls stanky, we could pop those\nGot that old lady for ya nostrils\nI've been known to hail it since a snot-nosed\nTryna bang the hinges off the spot doe\nWolves walkin' on egg shells\nNow I'm tippy toein' on hot coals\nMoon walkin' into cosmos\n\nLet's get it\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou got those from Costco's?\nStraight to Trapper's Alley, Alejandro\nI'm going going, back back to Cali Cali, nigga pronto\nFor them marijuana from my vatos\nSend that heroina from Morocco\nDown to Tijuana, now we outro\nTo the Caribana in Toronto\nThough you knew a couple niggas cop bowls\nMy Ricans(sp) grab it by the crop load\nDuckin long ranger on the desert trail\nStrap a mule down, they call her \"Santo\"\nR.I.P.
