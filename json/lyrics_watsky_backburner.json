You're gonna leave California and for your own sake please don't force a mistake\"\nLife tends to take irregular courses guided by some devilish forces\nMaybe you could be my wife stepping from our second divorces before we turn forever to corpses\nI just think you're clever and gorgeous\nIf I ever get to enter that fortress\nAnd pour this pleasure into every orifice\nI won't be checking my watch\nI won't be checking it\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Mama said love's only half about love and the other half's time and if you want to find your better half baby then you better have timing on your side.\"\n\"Mama said love's only half about love and the other half's time and if you want to find your better half baby then you better have timing on your side.\"\nKeep me on the backburner\nKeep me on the backburner\nKeep me on the backburner\nKeep me on the backburner", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1aacc5c51f6e3a30a154e12a7fc3100f.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Oops!
