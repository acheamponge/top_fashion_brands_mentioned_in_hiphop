No no!\nHe's pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours\nDrawing out my nature with his hands\nYearning I'm so thirsty for his power\nBurning to be worthy of his land\n\n[Hook]\nHe's just like the water\nI ain't felt this way in years\nHe's just like the water\nI ain't felt this way in years\n\n[Bridge]\nCleaning me\nHe's purging me\nAnd moving me around\nHe's bathing me\nAnd he's claiming me\nAnd moving me around\nAround and around and around\nAnd around\nWatching me, claiming me\nMoving me around\nHe's purging me\nHe's been cleaning me\nAnd moving me around\nAnd around\nAnd around\nAround\nAround\nMoving me around\n\n[Spoken Outro]"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
