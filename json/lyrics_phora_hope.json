It impressed me that them little kids was like 14 and they\u2019re pumping people\u2019s gas instead of taking the money like I would think \u2014 that\u2019s the easy way \u2014 they\u2019re pumping people\u2019s gas. And you know people was cruel. They\u2019ll give you a quarter after watching you inhale vapors and everything. They\u2019ll give you a quarter for pumping gas. And I gave them little kids like fifty bucks. They was like, \u201cThank you!\u201d But that teaches them that when you work hard and be responsible, there\u2019s a reward for that. And I think that just like I did that, corporations can do that, and on a bigger level. Imagine if a corporation just sent a representative and said, \u201cJust go hang out in that playground, and \u2026 whatever kid is the coolest and shares the ball or lets the most people play basketball, we\u2019re gonna give them a scholarship.\u201d That would bring hope. There\u2019s no hope, and there\u2019s not going to be too many more Christmases without hope. \u2026 There\u2019s not going to be too many more days without hope\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I took so many chances in my life\nI'm surprised I'm still standing right here\nI never thought I'll make it yo\nJust a couple of years ago, I was living in a nightmare\nKnife in my chest, Knife in my back\nNever thought I'll be able to breathe again\nBut now I know I'm here for a reason but\nI just don't think this muthaf's see it yet\nI just don't think these muthaf's see it yet", "year": "2013-04-06"}]}
