(yo!) You're getting picked on in school\nThe other boys! (huh!) They say you just ain't cool\nWell, that's bullshit! (yeah!) We're gonna teach you the rules\nThose motherfuckers ain't gonna bother you no more\n\nWe are the bad boys (oh!) from the tough side of town\nWe are the Cool Patrol (whoo!) we'll turn your life around\nThose bullies (aw, shit) their ass is done for now\nWe're gonna show you how! So fuckin' listen y'all! First\u2026\n\n[Chorus: Dan Avidan]\nYou put your hands in the air\nAnd you jump off the ground\nAnd then you take that funky butt and you shake it all around\nAnd lightly jog in place and then crank it up to a prance\nThis is the Cool Patrol Dance\n\nNow put your hands in your pockets\nAnd take them right back out\nThen spin around in a circle and make an animal sound (moo)\nThen glide into the sprinkler like you're gonna water the plants\nThis is the Cool Patrol Dance\nWhee!\n\n[Spoken Interlude: Danny Sexbang, JackSepticEye]\nYou get all that kid?\nThat wasn't actually very helpful...\nThat was just like an instructional dance...\nHell yeah!\n\n[Verse 2: Danny Sexbang]\nMotherfuckin' bullies better watch their ass\nYou're sending all them shits a message there's a new king in class\nWhen they see you they're gonna freak out and piss their pants\nThey are your bitches!
