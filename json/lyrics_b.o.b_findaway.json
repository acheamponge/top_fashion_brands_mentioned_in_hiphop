Who gon' help us?\nThe red and the white and the blue has failed us\nI can't promise I'ma make it better\nBut I can show you how to be successful\nThe poor get poorer, the rich get richer\nLives are lost, too much to measure\nWe all tryna make it up from the bottom\nBut nowadays, the bottom's lower than ever\n\n[Hook]\nYou see many of us lookin' for\nSomethin' words can really not explain\nYeah, although many of us come and go\nI always knew that I would find a way\nI put my city on my back\nLookin' for another path\nYeah, although many of us come and go\nI always knew that I would find a way\n\n[Bridge]\nFrom the jungles of East Atlanta\nYou motherfuckers don't fuck up\nPlayers always fuck up at the wrong time\nOh, will they rise and go?\nAnd will they mind to say no\nOh, will they rise and go?\nAnd we ain't livin' by the same code\n\n[Hook]\nYou see many of us lookin' for\nSomethin' words can really not explain\nYeah, although many of us come and go\nI always knew that I would find a way\nI put my city on my back\nLookin' for another path\nYeah, although many of us come and go\nI always knew that I would find a way", "title": "Find a Way", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/477cfe89b3dce798b65dcf8211d2b51e.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
