It's entirely stressful upon my brain\nYou hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change\nWhen violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain\nThe silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms\nSome grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose\nThe streets sure to release the worst side of my best\nDon't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city\n\n[Hook: Pharrell Williams]\nMass hallucination, baby\nIll education, baby\nWant to reconnect with your elations?\nThis is your station, baby"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
