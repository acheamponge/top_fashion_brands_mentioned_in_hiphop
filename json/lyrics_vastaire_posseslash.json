Hah.  Karniege.  Listen\n\n[Verse 1: Karniege]\nWhat you hear now is not a one-hit wonder (Uh uh)\nOne hit, wond-e-rous things happen (Look)\nWe slide out, it\u2019s like Crunch, Captain\nNot the cereal but suited like generals (Let\u2019s go)\nGripping the mic and moving any rooms\nSee Mighty Jo swing, smack from the bush\nGrimy flow kings rap out the wood\nWork when a boy twerk lines this good (Uh huh)\nWho say we hiding in the hood, playing Holly games?\nWe drop hits here at the party, mayne\nListen, woman or child, the hood\u2019s in the house\nNow start looking around for me, Brooklyn-bound (Look)\nQueens all-city, the kid putting it down (Look)\nProbably in another town, unhooking her blouse\nShe waving in the air, saying, \u201cLooky, meow\u201d\nPosse cut bodied her.  You better watch it, son\n\n[Verse 2: Breez Evahflowin\u2019]\nYo, I ain\u2019t trying to battle no more.  That shit is getting boring\nThe comp sucks.  My new hot stuff should get to touring (Hit the road)\nWords are like weapons soaring, leaving sets unplugged\nDisrespecting, it gets to you like Lauren\nShit\u2019s hard.  Smoke grass to let it off\nMe and Vast need cash, so we smash like ghetto raw\nStraight beating the fuck out this verbal session, stressing this bitch\n\u2018Til she\u2019s screaming like [?].  With herbal essence, I\nSpit a TEC at the mainstream, aiming at\nFake niggas who gang clean, ain\u2019t seen jack\nHip hop is much bigger than rap.  You going for mines?\nGet off the crack.  Bet on your ride?\nI break your prize, leave you walking back\nFor the green, I\u2019m a scene from the Hulk attack\nI\u2019m a vet.  You pose no threat.  You pussy\nOn the set like commercials with talking cats\n\n[Verse 3: Poison Pen]\nMy jersey been in the rafters.  Peep this towel-mouth\nBrooklyn monster.  Knuckle up, speedbag your tonsils\nPoison Pen\u2019s name\u2019s hitting in the street\nAll I do is threaten dudes to the rhythm of the beat\nBranch Davidians trail me.  Got a cult following\nTungsten for tonsils, low blows spit halogen\nThought your block was wild?  Watch out.  It\u2019s really off\nPoliticians pop off, turn the city hall to a city morgue (We want it all)\nIf there\u2019s a brawl, really, dog, it\u2019s prolly us\nTour bus boys ain\u2019t stalled working on a posse cut\nAyyo, lips on your face don\u2019t work.  Just like I\u2019m\nOn the desert, baby.  The same as gamma-ray-strong birth\nBitch!\n\n[Hook: Samples with DJ Cip One Scratches]\n\u201cRap representing\u201d - Sample from [?]\n\n[Verse 4: Aesop Rock]\nY\u2019all know the name:\nAesop fucking Rock.  Ain\u2019t a damn thing changed\nClubbed up in a property in helicopter hell\nWhen all he wanted was to drink copper, crawl out of well\nJumping Jiminy in a gimme-gimme industry\nNew York bleed bricks, piss huts, and shit liberty\nBriefing lizards, he sleeps the winters away\nWeight flips snarky out in demos.  Let him keep the scissors\nAnd all that good-good.  Smoked out and mobile\nWhen his tummy growls in vowels, shit almost looks remotely simple (Oh)\nSlumped on every portly mobile.  Porky ogre ace ignored\nA forty focal.  Folk adored a forgey quirksy motor\nFuck what I\u2019m gon\u2019 be.  This luck of the ugly\nAnd I\u2019m half-man, wormy, flunked, fucked.  What?  Dirty\nFrom the dump, suck dump truck.  Let the peril fester\nRight?  Curb your little ninjas and we\u2019ll all break bread together\n\n[Verse 5: Vast Aire]\nI know niggas in the street who delete oxygen\nIf you ain\u2019t really \u2018bout it, don\u2019t box him in (Don\u2019t do that)\nThere\u2019s no water but you gonna go swimming\nWe don\u2019t like y\u2019all.  We like women (I like girls)\nYou lie sweet but the truth\u2019s like lemon\nIf you touch her right, she\u2019ll start grinning (She\u2019ll start grinning)\nI got something if you want to touch hands\nSucker emcees better change they plans\nPass the baton.  I\u2019ll end the dash (End the dash)\nThat ain\u2019t all the herb.  It\u2019s only the stash\nAnd this ain\u2019t a posse cut.  It\u2019s more of a slash\nPart of the hurricane\u2014only the splash\nStyles upon styles upon styles is what I have\nYou trying to grab the Aire?  You don\u2019t know the half\nHah.  You better off up north\nAnd when you thinking we got you, the lights go off", "album": "Look Mom... No Hands", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ec5e65a416584a208b3230e59ddbdd2f.600x600x1.jpg"}]}
