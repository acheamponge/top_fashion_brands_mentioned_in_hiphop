That only happened once\nBut the good rise, but not for good guys\nHe gives new hearts and eternal life to the ones who should die\nHe gives our pain purpose, this is not in vain\nWe endure, in joy, for the end joy of seein' His face\nIt\u2019ll all make sense then\nYears of sufferin' made up for in an instant\n\n[Bridge: Jasmine Le'Shea]\nThis may be the last breath that I take but it's okay\nIt's fine by me, oh\nIf for some reason\nI\u2019m not here when you wake, it's okay\nI\u2019m where I need to be, oh\n\n[Outro: KB]\nThe average life span of a heart transplant is 10-15 years\nMy dear sister Jasmine is on year 11\nAnd as I get to know her, the more I find out\nNo matter what happens she has a heart that will\nNever stop beating\nI love it, yeah"}], "artist": "KB"}
