I.. am.. the.. man.. to.. stand.. top.. brand..\nNo.. band.. at.. hand.. and.. yes I can can, yes I can can\nRip the microphone to shreds\nBuck buck, rough and tough, and a little bit ragamuffin\nFor havin' a rapper that try to battle will stress me\nYou shouldn't address me cause you can't impress me\nSo don't test me, boy, I say you better move over\nYeah, yeah, huh\nMany people tried to say I fell off\nHe went R&B, now his rap is all soft\nBut if you say that on stage, I'll prove you wrong\nAnd wax that ass, rappin' off a love song\nCause with the street in all battles I'm still hard\nLike a mallet, servin' competition like salad\nI'm gonna give you some damn good advice G\nBreak out, before there be some sugar honey iced tea\nCause now you're comin' in the danger zone\nThere no man, can withstand, or hold his own\nI burn a rapper so bad that it bruise\nEven if you put a condom on the mic that I use\nThat won't protect ya, I still can effect ya\nCause I flip the script, like a movie director\nI'm makin' the non-believers believe what I'm dishin' up\nAnd people that's still fans, will be air conditioners\nWhy golly gee, I'm the hypest\nThe power to maintain, and sustain, cause I'm righteous\nIn other words, by knowledge and degrees\nYou gotta say God bless, and I don't mean when I sneeze\nA black man, you know I got, soul\nFor rockin' the track and sparkin' the mic that I hold\nNot just been flowin for the fellas so for the ladies\nI didn't forget you.. mwah *kiss sound*\nA lot of rappers today, know how to flow\nAlso, a lot of amateurs turned pro\nBut if I ask for the mic at your show\nAiyyo, I think you better let it go!\nCause I go in a rage on stage\nThe rap it never stops til I get my props\nAnd if you don't know my style, well look here my friend\nYou saw Faces of Death? Hehe yeah yeah aight then\nI'm tryin' to tell my competition the scoop\nThat I'm breakin' down, any soloist or group\nAnd even though, some of them try to play souped\nWhen I come on stage, they spread they wings like Troop\nAnd fly away, cause I don't play\nI slay, okay, okay?\nThe king of combat, my competition scat\nPockets stay fat, oh hells yeah, I'm all that\nThe one they like to follow, bite and borrow\nLock into my style, just like a Rottweiler\nSo you wanna know the meaning of hardcore?\nLooks like a job for...\n\n[Scratching]\nBig Daddy, Big Daddy\nBig Daddy, Big Daddy", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b6cc17d62fd6810516cc285d9804a8ab.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "1993-05-25", "title": "Looks Like a Job For...", "album": "Looks Like a Job For..."}]}
