(hell no)\nI make no demands (no demands)\nI just make amends. (make amends)\nI make my bed and I'm a lie in it\nBut before I die...please...don't take anymore of my friends\nPlease don't take anymore of my friends. (life is easy)\nThe smoke didn't kill Johnny (kill Johnny)\nThe drink didn't kill Johnny (kill Johnny)\nThe junk didn't kill Johnny (kill Johnny)\nAnd the women didn't kill Johnny\nWas it the road? (I don't know)\nWas it rock and roll? (I don't think so)\nBut God, God, God...would never...kill...Johny Cash\nHe had a train to catch\nHe had a date with death\nAnd we've all got a train to catch\nLife is easy. Holler at ya boy.
