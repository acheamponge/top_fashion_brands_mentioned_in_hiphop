You can say anything\nOpen up your eyes, does it feel like you're still dreaming?\nCongratulations, you just found yourself a real meaning\n\nOH! I gotta live up\nGet it right, you bet I give a fuck\nAnd if I get the feeling that I'm getting stuck\nI'mma take the grass and peel it up\n\nAnd I'm gonna build a roller coaster\nCause I haven't rode one in a while\nI'm gonna build a roller coaster\nCause I need a good reason to smile", "year": null, "album": "Postcards From Kansas City", "title": "Roller Coaster"}], "artist": "Mac Lethal"}
