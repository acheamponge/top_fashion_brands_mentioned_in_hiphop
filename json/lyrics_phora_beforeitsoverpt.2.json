1]\nVisions of me and my peeps at the top\nNothing came easy, we needed a plot\nAnd they said they'd doubt we'd ever make it\nBut thats the very same reason we fought\nSo close to giving up on life, I wanted to quit\nLike why keep going if they don't know you exist?\nBut the fans helped me down like no other\nSo I hope that you get everything that you ever dreamed of\nCause I know it's a bitch\nYeah, this thing we call life\nBut y'all are helping me make it through\nAll I dream of is my music doing the same for you\nBut tell me, wheres God when you need him?\nWhy does it only feel like the Devil is present\nWhen my mind is tempted by my demons\nShit, I guess this is all a part of his plan\nBut it's hard to keep my faith when everyone says that you hardly a man\nEven though you taking care of your fam\nEven though you put all your dreams on the line\nAnd gave them all that you can\nI give my life for them, would they do the same for me?\nIt got me thinkin if the shit they said was make believe\nCause it just seems like all they ever do is take and leave\nAnd leave me in the dust, without a place to be\nPeople lookin' in from the outside, they don't know what you feelin'\nMy worlds caving in, I'm suffocating, crushed by the ceiling, the walls are closing in\nAnd 4 years back, if you asked anyone about Marco they just say I lost hope in him\nWell i ain't even have hope in myself\nAnd they keep saying they feel me, but they don't know how I felt\nWhen I was on the ground dying, screaming just for someone to help\nBut no one came, I had to comfort myself\nGoing through a pain, I just couldn't take\nI might much rather die, it gets to me everytime\nI ain't even tell my mother goodbye\nThese niggas try to kill me, like really these niggas tried\nSo it must mean that there's a reason I'm breathing and still alive\nAnd I dont want revenge\nI want the niggas to see me thrive and live my dreams and watch me change the world\nAnd one day realize that they can do it too\nThey just need someone to open their eyes\nCause I ain't got no hate In my heart for not one of these guys\nCause all these cats wanna be gangsta, and I just wanna be me\nJust wanna be free from the world and shit thats all on tv\nSeems like I'm dodging all my incoming calls, ain't replying to texts\nMan Im just tryna get away from it all\nAnd Moms deserves a new house, but I just can't afford it\nFeel like I got the perfect song but I just can't record it\nIf this was my last song, how long would it last?\nSee, I know I've fucked up but now thats all in the past\nCause everything could be gone in a flash\nSo watch me pave the way and have a team of leaders follow my path\nAnd I bet my teachers couldn't name a day they saw me in class\nFuck around, and have me speak to your students, watch all of them pass\nYou ain't succeed till you fall on your ass\nCause shit, we fell way too many times to count, now all of us laugh\nBut they say men cry too\nEvery teardrop from my eye, I ask myself\nWhat have you done good for besides you?\nI'm still a kid so I still make mistakes\nI just wanna live, before the good times fade away now\nBefore the good times fade away now\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd where is everyone I used call my friend?\nI've been so lost inside myself, I guess I lost my touch within'\nI mean, I don't blame them, I got too much on my mind\nTrust issues from the past, but I wish I could press rewind\nAnd take it all back\nFuck rap, fuck the media, fuck the news, the internet, and all these fuckin' lies they feeding ya'\nFuck apologies, cause everything I did, it happened for a purpose\nAnd fuck em if they ever said you worthless\nSo, fuck my anxiety, fuck my depression\nI just can't figure out the reason why the fuck I've been stressin'\nAnd fuck trying to love someone who just dont seem to love you back\nCause we all deserve someone to be there when we feel trapped\nOr lost and confused, we all got something to prove\nBut I just can't stand the thought of losing someone like you\nFuck stressing on the people that put you down for no reason\nFuck the ones who said they didn't believe in everything that you said you would do\nAnd now that its done, they start to come running\nFuck drinking to the point that you feel nothing\nFuck the rumors, fuck the gossip, dog, fuck they assumptions\nFuck the ones that said they had your back when they knew they was frontin\nAnd fuck every doubt that they had against you\nThey was clowin on you, you thought they was clowin with you\nBut it's all good\nShit, I guess it's all a part of his plan\nCause everything they said I'd never be, is all that I am\nYours Truly\n\n[Outro]\nDear lord, please bless us with the strength to make it through these hard times and when we can't find our way, please let your light be our guidance, and if anyone shall be looking down on another person may, they only be our loved ones looking down on us from the heavens and may you bless us with the courage to be ourselves rather then fool ourselves the start of a new legacy, in Jesus name I pray, Amen", "year": "2015-01-05"}]}
