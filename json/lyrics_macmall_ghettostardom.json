Oh, never that!\nI'm hittin' fence after fence until I'm chillin' at my doormat\nLike a mack I had to get away\nCause I'm a smooth operator, ask Sade\nBut the rollers in the V is so shady\nIf they could, they would plan something on me\nBut really, them ain't the fools I gotta worry 'bout\nCause white folks goin' loced in the white house\nAnd I doubt a republican or democrate\nGives a fuck about us young inner city blacks\nIt's a trap, Uncle Sam keeps cursing me\nRather have me in the pen than the university\nYeah, it's a shame but mane, that's how it is\nSo ya better peep game and try to lace ya kids\nCause it ain't no tellin' what's soon to come\nWhen the punk president might drop the bomb\nGot me all stressed out with my brain on numb\nMy little cousin asking me where dope come from\n\nChorus:\nThey try to tell us in the verses and the scriptures\nBut I guess the real message must have missed us\nIn '96 all my brothers and my sisters\nIs on a mission, we're trippin' livin' senseless\nTell me, will I see the sun in days to come\nWill blacks be the victors instead of victims\nOr will my people keep killing over fuckin' crumbs\nPushin' dope just to reach ghetto stardom\n\nIf you ask Mac Mall who I'm voting for\nI say:'Farrakhan' as I'm hittin' the bong\nI put the flame to the swisher or the dohja spliff\nGet elevated to another as I reminisce\nAbout fresh candy paint and peanut butter tops\nYoung hustlers havin' paper, livin' top notch\nAnd then the D-game straight decline\nAnd all you Sawyer turf niggas makin' headlines\n10 o'clock news or America's most\nUnsolved mysteries, you better soak some dope\nThen the judge starts droppin' the injuries\nOn all the gangstas, playahs, macks and G's\nAnd you know you won't see 'em til about 2 thou'\nCause ya boy got washed with a faulty assed trial\nBut at least one day he gone be free\nSome soldiers ain't never gonna see the streets\nThat's why I keep servin' game over my beats\nSo all my people, in and out, can straight feel me\n\nChorus\n\nThere is nowhere for me to run\nNowhere for me to hide from reality\nBut I don't wanna be a casualty\nOf another tryna smother a brother just cause my salary\nAnd dog, I tell ya that these times' so sick\nThat my sister's smoking dohja, 8 months pregnant\nMy brother bubble on the grind and he's way legit\nWorking on his third strike and he still won't quit\nBut I can't tell him nuttin' bout a salary job\nSo in order to get tha paper the boy gotta mob or sob\nAll will fall to the waistside\nWhile the rollers overlook they wanna take lifes\nYoungstas they gettin' raised off the T.V\nGot white kids around the country wanna be me\nAnd the way they point the finger ain't even shob\nTelevision replace religion, now the gangsta's god\nAnd old folks wonder why we so crazy\n90 knuckleheads and 70 high babies\nAnd can't nobody tell me that I'm wrong\nUncle Sam finding ways to fit computer chips in my dome\nSo I should ask before you slip\nSee it's higher than the ultimate trip\n\nChorus\n\nYou know, dedicated to DJ Cee, S-Double the Mac\nReach Ghetto Stardom", "year": "1996-04-23", "album": "Untouchable", "title": "Ghetto Stardom"}], "artist": "Mac Mall"}
