The difference between that ledge and that edge is that that ledge is the tip of the edge. And that edge is the border between life and death. That's all we have left. Shoot skills out your brains before you have breaths. Dom Dom competitor; be the reverend and also the editor, et cetera. Come better to heat your black ass up like a sweater; to shoot you to the mystical magical man in motion - God! Blends into my skin like lotion! Do this thing all day on the daily; swing styles like Barnum and Bailey. Dom Dom drops the bomb-bomb, keeping it calm-calm. Register now! Knowledge, knowledge, people! Peace!", "year": "1999-02-23"}]}
