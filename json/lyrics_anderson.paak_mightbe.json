You can tell me if I'm wrong\nBut I'm feelin' that ya might be\nAnd we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope\nAnd I'm thinkin' you'd like to be\nEvery word I speak got you floatin' off your seat\nAnd I'm knowin' that you like me\nOh you high baby, high baby\n\n[Verse 1]\nOkay, the blunt is rolled up\nNobody lit it\nSaid even if we don't puff\nWon't make a difference\nMy body's leaning to the right baby\nYou tell me 'go on and spend the night baby?'\nNo, I don't even know ya\nI know enough to get you high baby\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI got about a half an ounce of that tree\nGot about a half a cup of that lean\nI said go on and kick your feet up\nI'mma go ahead and twist the weed up\nShe said cool to say what I think\nI said go and do what you feel\nShe said bend me over that sink\nI said damn your wish is my will\n\n[Chorus]\nI get the feelin' that ya might be\nDid I turn you on? You can tell me if I'm wrong\nBut I'm feelin' that ya might be\nAnd we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope\nAnd I'm thinkin' you'd like to be\nEvery word I speak got you floatin' off your seat\nAnd I'm knowin' that you like me\nOh you high baby, high baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nOkay, I'm feelin' so stuck\nLaid up on the couch, got fingers in your mouth\nGirl, bring it closer\nBefore my high comes down, my high comes down\nGirl, I can barely keep my eyes open\nYou say you tryna get your spine blown in\nNo, I don't even know ya\nI know enough to get you high floatin'\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI got about a half an ounce of that tree\nGot about a half a cup of that lean\nI said go on and kick your feet up\nI'mma go ahead and twist the weed up\nShe said cool to say what I think\nI said go and do what you feel\nShe said bend me over that sink\nI said damn your wish is my will\n\n[Breakdown]\nFeelin' that ya might be\nOh tell me are you high, baby\nI get the feelin' that ya\nTell me you high as me?\nOh tell me are you high?\nTell me you high? Are you high, are you high as me?\nOh tell me are you high?\nTell me you are, tell me are you high as me?\n\n[Chorus]\nI get the feelin' that ya might be\nDid I turn you on? You can tell me if I'm wrong\nBut I'm feelin' that ya might be\nAnd we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope\nAnd I'm thinkin' you'd like to be\nEvery word I speak got you floatin' off your seat\nAnd I'm knowin' that you like me\nOh you high baby, high baby"}]}
