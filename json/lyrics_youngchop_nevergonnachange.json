what could I say but\nLot of niggas young like me\nTryna get out of the streets\nHalf of these niggas can\u2019t eat\nThat\u2019s why they probably been following me\nI don\u2019t be catching no tweets, I just made a page\nGet on my business for sure, they know that\u2019s my name\nThey watching my ways, listen to every little thing that I say\nTryna get in every little pic that I take, following every bad bitch that I play\nSo what can I say, know that we paid\nI do this like every day\nYou and these niggas be lame\nBetter stay out of my way\n\n[Chorus: Johnny May Cash]\nAnd once I
