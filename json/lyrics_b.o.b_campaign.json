Really, you were better off without one\nSideline haters, they can\u2019t tolerate the outcome\nYou're the runner-up type, me they cannot outrun\nSit your whack-ass down, calm the fuck down some\nTake a fucking Valium, now DJ crank the volume\nTell her like\n\"Keep your head steady I\u2019m about done\"\nPassed out, please don\u2019t wake me up until the ounce comes\nI\u2019m in the hood like an Obama sticker\nI\u2019m from the hood, you're a neighborhood watch nigga\nI'll fall through with a \"made you look\", watch nigga\nPissing niggas off like swastikas\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Playboy Tre]\nI'm campaigning with my Ace, he just beat a case\nSo we've got liquor by the crates, yelling \"fuck the state\"\nI guess that you can say it\u2019s fate\nThat we made it from the bottom of the bottom\nWhere somebody's always shooting, but don\u2019t nobody know we shot \u2018em\nI just pray the angels got him, I hope the Lord embrace him\nI swear to y'all, the streets are Hell\nThat\u2019s why I call my pistol Satan\nIf we don\u2019t make it then it\u2019s back to doing Devilish things\nNow tell that freak to drop it lower than her self esteem\nDeath to my opponents, this is my crowning moment\nThe life we livin' can't be rented boy, you gotta own it\nI\u2019m feelin lethal, sipping Brandy, that Moesha\nYou saw that buzz uppercut, that's how the flow will treat ya\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Campaign", "album": "Fuck Em We Ball", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c15dbab29cd7e31286511ae5be6d5fed.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
