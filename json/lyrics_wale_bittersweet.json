Uh\nThe long road to success is dangerous\nThat's why I never claimed I was the best\nI want to be their breath\nDon't want to be the king\nAin't tryin to be your god, just want to live my dreams\nPut it on everything, history I'mma make\nTypically, those great have predetermined faith\nMostly cause niggas hate you, tryin to fill up your plate\nNigga's carnivore when there's so much at steak\nAin't tryin to fight no war against my brother\nBut I'm a man first and I demand my respect from all 'em\nSuccess sweet, nucka, is why I keep lookin'\nBut every other bite it slightly needs suga\nLike whenever I look up, I'm expecting the light\nI'm abusing the sunshine so I'm technically blind\nTranslation cause my life is too sweet\nI can always go home and look down my street\n(It's bittersweet)\n\nThis is a symphony\nThe bittersweet of life, of life\nWalk on with your scars, don't turn around\nRun utill you see light, till you see light\nThis is a bittersweet life (life) (X2)\n\nUh, this bittersweetness of this artform\nNiggas will find a way to tweak it till the art's gone\nUnderstand every imperfection\nI just embrace it and take it in within my essence\nWith little effort, soon they will all respect it\nI am the smelling-salt to whom soever narcoleptic\nSuccess is what I work for, and when them dudes hate\nThey make it worth more\nChris Wallace said the sky was the limit\nAnd only make news when your quarters are in it\nSo I'mma push it to the end and take quarters on shots\nIf im in gin till I win it\nOr pain kill it, cause I ain't tryin to feel it\nSee I'm just tryin to fill up banks like Hilla-\nRead all about me, believe that without me\nThere is truth in these lies and they bleed on without me\n\nThis is a symphony\nThe bittersweet of life, of life\nWalk on with your scars, don't turn around\nRun utill you see light, till you see light\nThis is a bittersweet life (life) (X2)", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/e0cde0eabe61c1ddca97cce2386792d2.421x421x1.jpg"}]}
