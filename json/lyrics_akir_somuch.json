{"songs": [{"title": "So Much", "lyrics": "[Akir]\nThe world we live in, requires us to develop this ego\nIt defends us from criticism and hides our insecurities\nAnd we wear this facade as a badge of pride so long\nThat we forget what's truly underneath\nIt's the points where we at our loneliest and darkest moments\nThat it becomes apparent, there's still, so much\n\nDead or alive I will survive, yo I'm tried and true\nTrials that you get through and tribulations that'll send you\nTo the nuthouse, big house or dirt dig'd out of the earth\nAnd headstone just to honor your worth (just to honor your worth)\nEngraved with your birthdate and models poppin bottles at the bar\nA big car that we brawl over, the way it's are\nWe gettin over even classy in the Range Rover\nHe feels threatened, protectin his thoughts as a soldier\nThe older we grow, the more sober gets old\nThe high, of adrenaline barely compares to modern medicine\nThen again if we lived like we supposed to\nSmokin chronic, drinkin tonic out in Acapulco, you say \"Let's go\"\nBut it would probably drive us loco, enough to go postal\nFuck around and have a choke-hold on a local\nUntil you see the po-po, I'd say the system definitely hope so\nThere's so much that's in my soul, yo\n\n[Repeat 2X]\nSo much we need to know, so much we need to blow\nSo much that we need to show, so much that it's in my soul\nSo much we need to grow, so much we'll never fold\nSo much that a nigga owe, so much that it's in my soul\n\nSo much...\n\n[Piano plays to the end]", "year": null, "album": "Legacy", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ec568067b0f966b9ee18a0f87677e60e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "AKIR"}
