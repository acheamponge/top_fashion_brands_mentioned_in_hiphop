Look what you done\nTeamSESH, DeadBoy, drop it on your head boy\nNever not cashed, make a mountain of ash\nEvery day of the past I dread boy\nI stumble over my own feet, too high to function\nI'm coming, open up my catalog, I've done it\nTo be humble, you say you underground, but you just under\nHonest, every time we drop we got them running\nWhat\n\n[Break]\n\"Warning, warning, warning, warning\nWarning, warning, warning, warning\"\n\"This is a message from John [?]\nIf you're receiving this message, you're in the blast zone\nCities within forty miles are infected\nYou must seek shelter immediately\"\n\n[Hook]\nYeah, you can talk, but, no, you can't hide\nEngine that couldn't bitch you cannot ride\nThe track that I'm on is for the divine\nDeadBoys multiply then divide\nWhiteNoise on the screen, make me blind\nSESH is the one that I trust now\nI got no need for a bust down\nUsed to be down, but I'm up now", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2f809c3829d1ad05d17bb97d55ff3080.1000x999x1.jpg"}]}
