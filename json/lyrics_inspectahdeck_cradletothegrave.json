Is it worth the battle?\nIn search of Heaven I can get trapped too\nSometimes I wanna join you, take my place upstairs\nBut I'm not ready to leave my family in despair\nI know if you was here you'd be rockin' the latest Nike Airs\nAll the fires gear burnin' one, totin' hardwear\nOr we hit Lennox, check precise set of Lexus\nCheck the message on the pager; \"it's two bucks the next chicks\"\nI had to do this, for Earnie Sayon and Aaron Lewis\nAnd all my families that have been through this\nAnd I know my days are numbered too because of you\nAiyo you got it locked, hold me a spot for when I come through\n'Til then I gotta be strong, a time bomb\nOne step from doin' life, my rap sees miles long\nBut like simply when I keep holdin' on\nBut I can only hold on for so long\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Inspectah Deck]\nIt's a Cold World kid, you ain't really missed much\nIt's hard just to get up, it's hard not to give up\nI struggled tryna move up, I might lose touch\nBeen fightin' all my life for my right to do such\nTo all my single mothers strugglin'\nLife bitters to the thugs out hustlin', here me\nTo all who walked the long road and met the end of the route\nI miss you all so I send this out\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c3d252f814a4716a7a99fe1984ad2678.948x936x1.jpg", "album": "The Movement", "year": null}]}
