Ave and I'll meet you at eight\" (aight)\nNow I'm amped up because I'm takin her out\nBut you know what's on my mind and what I'm thinkin about ('bout)\n\n[Break - Cuts by DJ Revolution]\n\"Sex\"\n\"Is what I'm after, uh huh\"\n\"Y-y-you gotta put me on\"\n\"Sex\"\n\"Is what I'm after, uh huh\"\n\"You got, you gotta put me on\"\n\"Sex\"\n\"Is what I'm, what I'm after, uh huh\"\n\"You got, you gotta put me on\"\n\"Sex\"\n\"Is what I'm, what I'm after, uh huh\"\n\"You gotta put me on\" (gotta put me on, put me on)\n\n[Verse 2 - Akrobatik]\nYo, she was like Rosario Dawson and Claudette Ortiz\nWith a little Halle Berry and Angelina Jolie\nWhen she spoke it was like Lauryn Hill or Maya Angelou\nAll of those brains and body too hot to handle to (woo!)\nAny hoo, I made my way on the train\nThinkin a couple drinks later, I'd be gettin some brains\nBut halfway through dinner, I'm like \"what was I thinkin?\"\nShe's like \"you ain't drivin, so I ain't drinkin!\"\nSee I was much younger then and nowhere near as well traveled\nSo what little game I had now, quickly unraveled\nBut we did make it back to her place, albeit sober\nSo I'm thinkin that there's a chance that I might still get over\nNope, all we did was watch \"Coming to America\"\nEddie's gettin a bath and I'm left here to stare at her\nBut I'm a man dammit, screamin heterosexual\nThere's plenty of time for her to find me intellectual\nWent in for some sugar and she gave me a kiss\nBut when it didn't go no further, I'm like \"what the hell is this?\"\nNow she's all annoyed and your boy is frustrated\nShe told me that I would have been straight, if I just waited\nNow I'm sittin home, all alone and I just hate it\nI bet she would have loved me to death, if we just made it (word)\nBut you know I ain't dealin with no deficit\nI'm callin up around the way friend with benefits\n\n[Break - Cuts by DJ Revolution]\n\"Sex\"\n\"What I'm, is what I'm after, uh huh\"\n\"You gotta put me on\"\n\"Sex\"\n\"Is what I'm after, uh huh\"\n\"Y-y-you gotta put me on\" (gotta put me on, gotta put me on)\n\n[Verse 3 - Akrobatik]\nI think it's funny, how us brothers always livin in doubt\nLike how if we don't get no tail right away, then we out\nBut we'll kick it with the chick that give it up the first week\nAnd never trust us her because we always suspect she a freak\nNow you could break a woman down with seductive tactics\nBut it always come back on some foot up the ass shit\nWhen you kick it to a lady, brother know what she wants\nCause if it's sex she wants, then it's sex she'll flaunt\nBut it's somethin to be said about a girl that's refined\nWhen that bangin body is equally matched by her mind\nSo now when a hunny wants to wait, you know I'm a let her\nBut don't get it twisted baby girl, the sooner, the better\n\n[Outro - Cuts by DJ Revolution]\n\"Sex\"\n\"Is what I'm after\"\n\"You gotta, you gotta put me on\"\n(*scratching*)\n\"Uh huh\"\n\"Sex\"\n\"Is what I'm after\"\n\"You gotta put me on\"\n\"Uh huh\"\n\"Listen to me, ah hunny listen her please\"\n(*Next line is scratched several times until end*)\n\"You gotta put me on\" (gotta put me on)", "title": "Woman Pt.
