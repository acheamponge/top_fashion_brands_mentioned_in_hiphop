Now let me ask you this question)\nWhy you pickin' on me?\nShut up and sit down! I told you to sit down!\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nDon't use it all at once\nBaby girl, your prime is about that long\nDon't use it, timing is all we got\nBaby girl, your prime is about that long\n\n[Verse: Anderson .Paak]\nOh, hell no\nI had to get back for the candy, uh\nI flew for an hour then landed, oh\nShe live on a beautiful campus, oh\nShe dumb as a brick but she pass all her classes\nKnow what she want and she know I ain't shit but a savage, ooh\nShe soaking up game\nHer brain is a series of pamphlets, wow\nShe told me a story as long as her lashes\nOh what a hopeless romantic\nFucking with jokers and addicts\nShe told me everybody close to her age is full of mad shit\nI said, 'Baby girl, you ain't even old enough to be jaded'\nAnd wow, she want visual stimulation\nShort attention span and little patience\nI like Hennessy and record players\nTeddy Pendergrass and Sammy Davis\nOpposites attract. I swear, we a magnet\nDon't be fucking up your scholarship\nI can't help you with grants\nWord to my father, my word and my balls is 'bout all that I honor\nAs God is my witness if you don't jump back in this bed\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nDon't use it all at once\nBaby girl, your prime is about that long\n(Do what you want, what you want, as long as you jump in the bed)\nI only want to do what feels right\nI have to be gone before the midterms\nYou making up your mind, you're out of songs aren't you?\nI wanted an encore, more tunes\n\n[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]\nHey, come back to bed\nCome back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah\nCome jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah\nCome back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah\nCome jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah\nCome back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah\nCome jump in the bed, jump in the bed with me, ah\nCome back to bed, come back to bed with me, ah\nCome jump in the bed\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nDon't use it all at once\nBaby girl, your prime is about that long\nTiming is all we got\nBaby girl, your prime is about that long"}]}
