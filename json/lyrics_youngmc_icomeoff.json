{"songs": [{"title": "I Come Off", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHey, hey, ya, ya, you got it going on\nAah na-na, na-na\n\nNow I wrote this record for when I perform\nLonely nights inside a university dorm\nI put pen to paper with a paper and pen\nFor the times I'm rockin' the mic in front of women and men\nI get raw like Eddie, rough like Freddy\nKrueger with a Luger turnin' men into spaghetti\nI'm like Fats Domino, off of Blueberry Hill\nBecause my rhymes are funky fresh and not run of the mill\nJust like a king has palaces I give an analysis\nYou can't talk because you suffer from paralysis\nOf the mouth, of the lip, of the tongue\nComin' to you compliments of a brother named Young\nNow you can't talk because I'm leaving you speechless\nSo be quiet and let an educator teach this\nIt's due to my producer, so he's in a rage\nAnd Mike you control the vinyl I'll control the stage\n'Cause I come off\n\n[Verse 2]\nFour score and seven years ago\nThere were a whole bunch of rappers who were in the know\nFour score and seven years later\nI dig holes in those rappers like the moon with a crater\nBecause to battle me you're really taking a risk\n'Cause you're an eight track tape and I'm a compact disc\nLike Tyson drops boxers in rapid succession\nThat's how I'm droppin' MCs in the rappin' profession\nI'm comin' off, just like the clothes on a hooker\nAnd I can fly like Jimmy Superfly Snuka\nLike a shuttle goes up into outer space\nPeople's hands go up when I enter the place\nI don't mean to brag or boast or to tell ya I'm great\nBut I can rock the microphone like Dorothy Hamill can skate\nYeah, I can say a funky rhyme like Greg Louganis can dive\nDon't have to be Saturday night for Young MC to get live\n'Cause I come off\n\n[Chorus]\n\nYo I come off, My name is Young MC and baby I come off\nYo the brother's comin' off, Bust this, Here we go\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow one behold, Young MC struck gold\nFrom the rhymes that I've been sayin' to the young and the old\nFrom the battles I've been havin' with the smart and the dumb\nFrom the records I've been makin' with the mic and the drum\nYou know the other rappers wanna play a game with me\nThey run and hide when they hear the name of Young MC\nLike a kid playing tag, that's how it's got to be\nSo when I start I say Olly Olly Oxen Free\nYo, you can never write a rhyme as strong as this one\nSo pay attention cause you don't wanna miss one, of my healthy rhymes\nNobody's are healthier, New York, New Jersey, LA or Philadelphia\nCity to city, and town to town, place to place\nCountry to country, 'cause I get around\nEven if you were in prison you'da heard me play\n'Cause the warden had me rock and I'm on the PA\nSo when you get out come and see my show\nAnd if you start static back in you go\n'Cause comin' off is the title and the theme of the jam\nAnd when the rhymes are finally finished people say God damn\n'Cause I come off\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI come off. Yo baby, I come off.
