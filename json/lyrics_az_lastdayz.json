High officials\nThey move so cleverly, don't ever sleep\nGot my mind on the proverbs, ecclesiastics\nThese Bible words, so absurd, I read em' backwards\nThey open doors, gave me a cause to stay swift\nAnd reward, it gave me the sword to stay rich\nUnderstanding is the best part, besides that\nI fell-a off to a fresh start, no time to sidetrack\nSo much more still to come, it seems strange\nI was much more iller young, but things change\nTrying to grow old, so many sights to see\nTold to never fold, just move righteously, you know?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: AZ]\nI never knew any Bloods and Crips, but they exist\nIn New York, it's just thugs and cliques, we offer chips\nMaking moves, trying to stay afloat, it get deep\nIn these streets, you either stay awoke, or get beat\nSo strategize like the wise king, respect due\nBrothers get high and let they mind scheme, I got tech\nWho in this world where so many stress, understand\nAin't nuttin left but the thoughts of death, we're sons of man\nSo off track it's a shame to see, it's open season\nGot police moving dangerously, for no reason\nHoping soon we can all adapt, get wise\nAnd realize it was all a trap, in disguise\nAssassinated by my own kind, so why ask\nWhat caused blacks to have a closed mind, deal with facts\nKeep your eyes open, never rock yourself to sleep\nLove to the East, let the dead rest in peace\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Outro: AZ]\nWe gotta do, what we gotta do\nBrothers, sisters, you gotta wake up, you gotta wake up\nAin't nothing gonna come from this\nWe gotta make it right now, we gotta make it right now, now\nThink about them baby\nYeah, think about them baby", "year": "1998-03-26"}]}
