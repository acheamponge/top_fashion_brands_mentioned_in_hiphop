Dot\nMaybe a beats hot, but syllables bleeped *out*\nMany men turn to mice when searchin' for cheese, auk\nPick up these guitars, not negative heat knocks, now\nI'm like an Rangular angular rhyme strangular\nBangin' the beats from here to Hallie\nAnd I'm manning a \"Microphone\"\nYou best respect Canada\nIn this musical famine\nSo here's some manna you can't examine\nI'm staggerin'\nDrunk amongst style\n\"Offishal\" like \"Kardinal\"\nBig up to Red1\nMisfit, they put me up in the mix\nZeb Rock's ghetto's comin' with a bag of tricks\nSICK!\n\n\nYO\nIt's over here!\nIt's over here!\nAnd we blow the spot\nPut ya' city on the map and it's called the T.Dot\nHere\nIt's over here!\nAnd we blow the spot\nPut ya' city on the map and it's called the T.Dot\n\nOh oh oh\nYa don' know?\nGrew up in Whitby, that's East of Toronto\nUsed to take the Jetta downtown to check the sound\nOf DJ X and Mastermindin' the underground\nNow I'm grown up but I feel stuck\nHip-hop head forever, tryin' to keep it together\nSometimes I think I'm goin' insane\nPressure bring, pressure flowin' on my head like rain\nBut fame can bring pain\nThat's why I got game and a rude attitude\nThat I call Emily *hay*\nSo you can get the Prozak if you claim to know that\nWhat I'm livin', I break it down like long division\nA mathematician, with inner vision like Stevie\nNo Wonder, I make a move-a from one street to\nVancouver\nLookin' for philosopher stone\nIt's over there-no?  It's over here-what?\nIT'S OVER HERE!\n\n\nYO\nIt's over here!\nIt's over here!\nAnd we blow the spot\nPut ya' city on the map and it's called the T.Dot\n\nHere\nIt's over here!\nIt's over here!\nAnd we blow the spot\nPut ya' city on the map and it's called the T.Dot\n\nOhhh ohhh ohhh ohhhhhhh"}], "artist": "\u200bk-os"}
