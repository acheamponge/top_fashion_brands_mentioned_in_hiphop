I'll make careers disappear\nLike hocus - pocus - no joke, it's Push'\n\n(Malice)\nMercy, mercy! Oh Lord who is he?\nWho curse me, curse me? But doing me\nIt hurts me so, puts me through changes\nSo I got Porsche's and Hummers to deal wit the anguish (oh, oh!)\nActs live, but only if you speak the language\n...And the rest is Comic View\nStar Trak The Movement, who you pay homage to?\nYou don't want it with them boys, this I promise you, you pussy!\n\n(Chorus)"}], "artist": "Clipse"}
