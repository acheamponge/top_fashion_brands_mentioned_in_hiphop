(laser guns) ( check your window) Swag)\n\nBoy, I don't even know what you were thinkin'\nWhen you said \"Hey Kitty could you fill up my drink?\"\nSo I went into the kitchen, spent some time at the sink\nNow I'm handin' it to you, dammit Sam stop winkin\nJust don't ask me what was in it, I see you gettin' sleepy\nI tried to write a love song that wasn't this creepy\nBut I gotta be true to my art\nAnd soon you'll be exactly like Elizabeth Smart\nNow I'm in control of what it says on your charts\nWhen the nurse is checking on your pulse and vitals and heart and shit\nOh your heart (aww) I wanna part of it\nNow I wanna get into the very heart of this\nYou'll never hear this, it's disheartening\nMy eyes keep undressing and my knives keep sharpening\nAnd every time I see you it's a lil bit startling\nThe butterflies or demons or whatever start garglin'\n\nThe blinds wide open so we can see you in the dark when you sleepin'\nYour body fresh out of the shower\nYou touch yourself after hours\nChill out\nYou're sleepin' alone\nCheck your window, check your window, we're at your window\n\nThis might be a bad start to get off to\nBut i really didn't mean to acost you\nI just really like your hair and how it's all slick and stuff\nI spilled a lil of your blood I kind of want to lick it up\nBut I guess that wouldn't be vegan\nSo let's just drive around and listen to Sarah and Tegan\nYou don't even know me this is only a dream\nAnd I'm just thinkin' of your eyes nothing to do with your semen\n\n1,2 you're the boy that I want\n3,4,5,6,7, shit\nIt's the bullet if you say no after all this\nAnd I just couldn't take it you're so motherfuckin gorgeous\nYou're the boy that I want\n3,4,5,6,7, shit\nSolve equations baby you're my square root\nAnd I feel a lil weird thinkin' that you're this cute"}]}
