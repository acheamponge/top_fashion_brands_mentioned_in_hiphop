Juan Shinobi\nWith a ninja star i'll injure ya\nSprinting up the walls like a spider with a katana\nHead fast to the shrine now!\nFlash! Then I spy and scout!\nBlast! When I drop my bomb you'll be dying out in fire\nBlaow!\n\n[Hook 1]\nBuild it up tear it down!\nRip it to pieces and flip it around!\nBuild it up tear it down!\nRip it to pieces and flip it around!\n\n[Cogwheel]\nI'm cogwheel, here to grind your gears\nSo you better have washed behind your ears\nCos i'm coming in to clean up, but instead of lotion\nI'm bringing in loads and loads and loads of asplosions\nDamn i'm insane!\nI can openly stand in the fray\nSoaking up damage\nToting the rotary canon and spray\n\n[Nigel longshot]\nCan I just say it's an honour to be here?\nThrough my monacle and goggles\nGosh, I can see clear\nI'm Nigel Purdy Longshot\nAnd if you've wandered in my sights\nYou've obviously gone and picked the wrong spot!\nShot in the belly? Not on your nellie\nI specialise in headshots\nOr chopping my machete\n'Til your flopping like spaghetti\nYour wedding shots are rather messy\nCause i'll use remnants of your noggin as confetti!\n\n[Hook 2]\nBuild it up tear it down!\nRip it to pieces and flip it around!\n\n[Eliza Doolally]\nOMG! look at me!\nEliza Doolally\nLeet in toxicology. Got a PHD in AOE\nMy acid attack is massively accurate\nSplashes are stacking\nRacking up the kills\nYou slackers are still lagging!\nYou're lacking the ill swagger\nI have on the kill cam!\nAdd in the fact i'm as mad as a hatter\nAnd my appeal is apparent\nTake of your skin as if i'm peeling a carrot!\nA connoisseur of the miracle cure\nPour it like vintage claret\n\n[Sgt. Stone]\nI'm Sarge stone\nYou might know I'm large, bro\nI pack a bandanna, Hand cannon and an afro\nI'm a killing machine from the military!\nHalf human being, half barrage of artillery!\nI deal damage, Full frontal assault!\n'Til I reset everything you've done to default\n\n[Hook 2]\nBuild it up tear it down!\nRip it to pieces and flip it around!\n\n[Tony Turretto]\nDo you remember me?\nI'm the engineer\nThat will send my enemy up into the celestial sphere\nI'm Tony Turretto and when I set up a defence here\nYou can rest assured it'll be better than a fence\nYeah!\nI'm talking bullets\nCaulking turrets\nChucking rivets\nI brought the Brooklyn spirit\nAnd i'm fricking awesome with it!\n\n[Hook 2]\nBuild it up tear it down!\nRip it to pieces and flip it around!", "year": "2015-05-05"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
