I'm busy mentally\nWhy you look at my dreads and see another felony?\nWhy I preach cuh but relapse bad tendencies?\nWhy some of my childhood friends feed jealousy?\nI guessed this the road that I asked for\nCrash course, keep a bible on that dashboard\n\n[Chorus]\nDeer in the headlights\nYou know we can't stop, right?\nBlowing money out the window\nLiving life bilingual\nA deer in the headlights\nYou know we can't stop, right?\nYou know we can't stop, right?\nYou know we can't stop, right?\n\n[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]\nParkside, carry razors in my SBs\nJust in case the law wanna test me\nI need a paper, multiple choice, how to get the fetty\nBut the big homie said a nigga wasn't ready\nNever overlook the underworld\nBesides diamonds and pearls\nAddictions sketchy women\nKillers that's real life vicious\nStab your moms in the kitchen\nAnd tell her son do the dishes\nI know it's fucked how we get the riches\nStill with spaceships, fuck bitches\nAnybody fuck with us? Burn bridges\nAccount numbers not mine, still hitting\nSo don't forget, niggas would die for your position\nSo go and make the crack to keep us dope boys listening\nThe beast heat rock, you can go and make a living\nNigga fuck a block, worldwide's a better vision\n\n[Bridge]\nOoooooo\n\n[Chorus]\nDeer in the headlights\nYou know I can't stop, right?\nBlowing money out the window\nLiving life bilingual\nA deer in the headlights\nYou know I can't stop, right?\nBlowing money out the window\nLiving life bilingual\n\n[Bridge]\nOoooooo\n\n[Outro]\nHol' up wait a minute!\n(Repeats until fade)"}]}
