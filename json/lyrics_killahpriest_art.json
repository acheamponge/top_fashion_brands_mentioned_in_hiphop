I probably would\nMe and my Annunaki army is good\nEven the mantis prays twice and once a day\nHe keep his arm folded just in case he forget\nAnd even a snake praise His name when he hiss\nDance with the Devil so I had to split\n\n[Hook x2: Killah Priest]\nArt imitates life\nSo when I write my heart, that emulates life\nAll heights and all depths\nLarge nations to small sects\nStanding ovation for old texts"}]}
