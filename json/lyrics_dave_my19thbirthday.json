A prison while I'm standing on an arrow\nWe used to have cards and now we're playing with swords\nMy G went from Blackjack to a black Jack Sparrow\nI know so many man who got a case on their head that would kill to come home\nBut there chances are narrow in this world that we live in\nNobody listens, we do have thoughts\nBut nobody's thinking and I get it\n'Cause none of us are tryna play the victim\nAny disrespect then retaliation, instant\nI know a lot of man have been dodging karma\nAnd they think it's all laughter 'till the bitch comes to kiss them\nYou know the difference between life and death is one bad decision, 3 or 4 inches\nSo many man my age have got P.T.S.D and I don't think that it's hit them\nIf you envision, the way that we're living\nThe things that we had seen, situations that we'd been in\nYou would understand why I don't wanna talk about my life in every song I've ever written\nI really wanna help, but it's out of my control and jurisdiction\n'Cause a lot of road yutes have got a sickness, mentally\n\n[Verse 3]\nLike, look\nMy mummy always used to tell me this\n\"David, listen when your older's speaking\"\nI know man that listened to their olders speaking\nAnd now they're all life'd off and they don't know the reason\nIn a weird way summer is the coldest season\nYou'll get killed at a party for the smallest reason\nOne day you're chilling in secondary\nNext day your right hand's a memory\nSo when I say that I'm alone, do you know the feeling?\nWhen I say the game's over, do you know the meaning?\nI mean that I don't have the time for this\nI need a girl but same time there's no time for them\nI got people inside and I don't write to them\nIt's like I don't feel pain no more\nI can't do journeys on a train no more\nCan't shed a tear writing on a page no more\nI don't wanna play games no more\nI don't want my friends on a case no more\nAnd trust me, I don't want a war on the ends\nBut it's like you wanna start it so say no more\nI'm too big for this nonsense, I don't need problems\nMeetings, 1.5 milli ain't an option\nI don't need a deal or an option\nIn my own neighbourhood\nMe, Jack, Benny in the office\nI don't need excel, Sony, drama\nOur team's faster, street Sam Chara\nI got a lot of love for everyone that checks for me\nAnd a lot of love for certain girls sexually\nTexting me, saying that she slept on me\nAnd definitely wishes that she slept with me\n\n[Verse 4]\nLook\nOn another note I wanna say thanks to Cal\nOne of my closest from young and we're still at it now\nI remember when we learnt to play piano\nJust to make each other jealous, who'd've thought that we would practice now\nYour talent's been standing out\nBe proud of your dream, you should stand and shout\nI remember last year you never had a clue\nAnd this year you went and did \"Attitude\"\nSpeaking of attitude, it's only right I say sorry for my attitude\nAnd I ain't never mad at you\nTyrell, Manon, Frasier especially\nI got a lot of things I'm dealing with mentally\nI feel down a lot and I ain't got the energy\nI need all of your help to get the best from me\nThere's way too much to do, I ain't getting sleep\nAnd last time I got a rest they arrested me\nTell me I treatment for a video I didn't make myself from scratch\nEvery lyric, every melody\nEvery fucking beat\nEvery little detail in the artwork and video\nEverything is me\nA wonderful team and a God that I serve\nMy friends and my mum, my brothers and my girl\nI don't want short-term success or a banger\nMan are signing to a sentence, getting lost in the words\nAnd it's fine if you sign man it's each to their own\nBut these clones need to know that I'm different from the world\nDon't compare me to them, they couldn't beat me at my worst\nIt don't matter if I'm rapping or I'm singing on the verse\n\n[Verse 5]\nLook\nPeople don't get that I'm serious\nI don't wanna play games no more\nAnd I don't wanna talk to these girls no more\nI can't fuck a girl that's in it for the fame no more\nAnd man can't talk on my name no more\nI give it 5 or 10 minutes 'till your main ting talks\nShe's telling me that they don't talk no more but I'm pretty sure that his wifey knows more\nNo more, no I don't wanna play no more\nNo talks if it isn't money made no more\nNo more, no I don't wanna play no more\nI don't wanna play no games no more\nAnd I don't wanna see my girl no more\n'Cause I don't really wanna see her hurt no more\nMy mum telling me that she's gotta stop working and I'm telling mummy you ain't gotta work no more\nNo more, mummy you ain't gotta hurt no more\nYou ain't gotta cry in your shirt no more\nMummy you ain't gotta wake up for work in the freezing cold in the middle of the night for a cheque no more\nMummy you ain't gotta cry no more\nYou ain't gotta stress in the night no more\nAnd I ain't gotta say no more\nWe ain't playing games no more", "year": "2017-11-03"}], "artist": "Dave"}
