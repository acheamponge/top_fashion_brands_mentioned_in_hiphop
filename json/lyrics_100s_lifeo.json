Bitch are you sure?\nThe last time I saw that bitch was back in 2004\nShe was bad you can't blame it on shit\nSince back when, Freek-A-Leek was on the radio and shit\nIf I remember correctly, don't ever sweat me\nDon't think I won't turn your broken heart into confetti\nAround six got a call from an unknown\nMust have been some ancient bitches playing up on my phone\nHit the store and got a bottle of rum\nThey gave it to me because they knew me\nMotherfucker I ain't twenty-one\nHad to kill it feeling made right now\nThen went on a drunk mission to my main bitch house\nGot some pussy then I passed out\nWoke up and hit it again because she was sleeping with her ass out\n\n[Hook]", "album": null, "title": "Life o", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/100s.jpeg"}], "artist": "100s"}
