(Watch out!)\nWatch out, my time is now!\n\n[Verse 3]\nJust had a thought of genius (yup!)\nWith a stroke of luck\nThink I'll never make it as an artist (well)\nThink I give a fuck?!\nI repeat, I rock Ducati\nYou know I'm gon' be looking up\nPut the city on my back 'til I can't walk no more\nYeah, that's what's up!\nIn front of all the doubters\nI'mma rub it right in their face\nBut the fanbase out this world\nWith no label in place\nAnd just in case you forget about me\nCheck out the Billboard charts every 4-5 weeks\nGuess whose name you fucking see?!", "album": "Into the Wild"}], "artist": "Sammy Adams"}
