Who really love ya? Who really love ya?\nLet me ask again, who really love ya enough to hug ya?\nTo tell you when you actin' like a sucka, who really love ya?\nThat's not rhetorical, give a call to whoever it is\nSay thank you for everything that they did\nLife is fragile, we here for a blink, and then it ends\nThe definition of family the same for the friends\nLoyalty thicker than any blood that's under your skin, uh\n\n[Break]\nHonest moments\nHow often do we have 'em?\nTell me\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe goi'g public with our highlights, yeah\nPrivate with our sin, throwing up\nPictures at the party\nNot the one throwing up at the end, oh Lord\nHonest moments, how often do we have 'em?\nEven with our closest hard questions, hope that they never ask 'em\nIronically, they feel the same, we both actin'\nI'm feelin' like a joke, that's why I try to keep 'em laughin'\nCrisis happen in my faith, I felt trapped and\nDidn't know if God was just something I imagined\nSame time, people got questions, they askin'\nMe about Jesus, but I ain't got the answer, uh\nIt's kinda crazy when you're known for your faith\nYou supposed to give it but you never get grace\nSo show up on stage and you put on that face\nI'm just tryna hold on, hope I finish my race, uh\nI just wanna hear Him say \"Well done\"\nHow I feel right now? Well, done\nAin't nobody askin' me how I'm doin'\nThey just like, \"Ayo, where the next album?\"\n\"Here it is\", honest to God, that's all I can be\nThey want the old Andy, girl, don't tempt me\nAnd as of late, I'm lookin' into therapy\nForget scarin' all these rappers, man I'm scared of me\n'Cause mental health issues in my family tree\nMy grandmother died of Alzheimer's\nLast time I see her, yo, she ain't even remember me\nI gotta wonder if the same end is meant for me, uh\nWent through depression in December 2016\nThe worst year I could remember\nI was sittin' down at breakfast with my wife, started weepin'\nTears fallin' down my face, I ain't even know the reason\nStarted readin', learned it's my body's way of releasin'\nStress that I been carryin' over the seasons, uh\nIn my darkest time, friends are what I needed\nBut I hadn't sown there so wasn't much for me to really reap and\nLosin' faith in things that I once believed in\nEven myself, I think Satan sent his illest demons\nMust be doin' somethin' right to get this opposition\nMeanin' I should go the hardest when I feel like quittin'\nGod, kill me if I ever start mixin'\nPersonal ambition and call it a righteous mission\n'Cause from a distance, most people couldn't tell the difference\nThat's the thing that make me ashamed to say I'm Christian\nGod, they lyin' on your name on the television, uh\nThey Benny Hinn gettin' Benjamin's, uh\nAnd yeah I get it, why most hate religion\n'Cause division and oppression is what been depicted\nTwo choices young man, make a decision\nThrow your hands up and say \"Forget it\"\nOr be the difference\nFour minutes of sharin' how I felt\nHonest with y'all 'cause now I'm bein' honest with myself\nHonest moments\nHow often do we have 'em?"}]}
