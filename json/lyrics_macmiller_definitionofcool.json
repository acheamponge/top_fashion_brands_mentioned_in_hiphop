Don't ask why, you so inquisitive\nAnd the shoes I'm wearing are only limited\nMy word, was that a bit much? A tad\nDidn't mean to rap, that was low class\nPardon my rudeness, that was so crass\nAnd I'm always making moves\nCause I never procrastinate\nThe number one spot is up for grabs\nToo late: what was that question you asked?\nWhat is the definition of C-O-O-L?\nIf you haven't gotten it by now, well, oh well\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Mac Miller]\nYou ain't cooler than me, get a job bitch\nYou ain't cooler than me, empty pockets...", "year": null, "album": null, "title": "Definition Of Cool"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
