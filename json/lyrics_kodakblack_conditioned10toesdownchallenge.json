For me to never come out of house?\nPop a X with my niggas, late night poppin' bottles\nJust wanna hit the store and a buy bottle of some water\nPost up on the stroll and hear what I been missing out on\nMy nigga say he went to rehab but he got right back on flocka\nMy other nigga popped a c class then that pussy came up out 'em\nLike it's winter I be posted like a snowman but it's Autumn\nSince elementary I wanted to be a G, I dreamed it back in Markham\nMomma I regret, I was always your lil' problem\nYoung nigga, I'm the husband in the house and I'm the father\nMy brother John Wicks, he was robbin' tell me nothing 'bout it\nMy brother was robbin' poppin' tops but he ain't never tell me 'bout it\n*Why didn't you pay for this beat though?*\nWhat you mean why I ain't pay for this beat? 'Cause ima motherfucking robber\nI was in Fort Myers I was 15, and I was servin' Demi Lovato\nI tried to shoot 'em, he had the voo on him, I turned into a monster\nI told my brother what happened to my revolver\nI was so mad I asked my brother  \"What the hell happened to my revolver?\"\nMy hammer broke, I ain't never seen this shit before\nMy hammer broke, I ain't never seen this shit before\nI was creepin', I was schemin', on that nigga on the low\nI promise ain't nobody see me that whole weekend in the 'No\nAy, Ay, the world cold I put that heater on 'em tho\nI wasn\u2019t stressing but I wanted to relieve it on him tho\nMy hammer broke, I ain't never seen this shit before\nIf I was him I woulda' beat me to the floor\nThen that nigga started creepin' very slow\nThat nigga he started leavin' very slow\nStarted skipping, giggling away like it\u2019s hilarious\nYeah he protected, but he still scared of me\nI was just 14 years old, I'm on methamphetamine\nY'all just sittin' 'round smokin' weed and watching Netflix\nEvery day I wanna do somethin' hot, in a stolo for no reason\nParked it in a vacant spot, and they towed 'cause I left it parked right in my neighbor lot, ay\nI put that burner on that nigga, told him if he make one more move he gettin' popped\nI dare you nigga, take one more step you gettin' stretched out\nI customized a 38, it got a drum like I'm [?]\nThat was my last lick, but this my next stop\nThat was my last lick, but this my next stop\n[?] my window roadrunning, got this rental here from Hertz\nI'm conditioned trained myself to stay authentic and be pure\nAnd I'm back in the black cat, make that kitty purr\nEverything I rap about these streets would vouch for me I'm sure\nClothesline in my backyard, no new white tee, rewash dingy shirt"}]}
