How does he do that?\nAlways coming up with a new rap\nAt a speed that's truly too fast\nWhile keeping it true to the boom bap, true that\nI don't mean to brag\nI'm just making up for what you lack\nPulling myself up by the bootstrap\nDifficulty curves need a new graph\nI cherish the chance\nTo perish, advance\nCorrecting errors and vanquish terrors\nThat dance in embers at camps\nEphemeral phantoms vanish as I replenish my flask\nRemember the past, then think ahead to the task, it's vast\nSummon embers from ash\nSlashing a veritable path through the Pantheon\nThe wrath of a champion\n\n[Hook]\nChilled fingers each rely on a spark\nTo ignite the pyre, summon fire from dark\nStoke the ash for embers 'fore they pry them apart\nSmoke rises, tiger of mind and lion of heart\nChilled fingers each rely on a spark\nTo ignite the pyre, summon fire from dark\nStoke the ash for embers 'fore they pry them apart\nSmoke rises, tiger of mind and lion of heart\n\n[Outro]\n(Ash...)", "year": "2016-04-14"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
