Boo me, fans send cards to me\nPunchlines will stall Cooney, since y'all knew me\nI've been deep like Paul Mooney\nI might show up so get a hearse\nAin't no nigga worse than me when I kick a verse, mics blow up\nLike a nuclear blast, you see a flash that melts ya\nA fallout shelter can't help your ass\nFrom Perce's versatility, hostility\nYou're wack black and lack the ability to kill the P\nWomen? I like, how I treat 'em? Like the mic\nI plug it in, turn 'em on and get hype and go\nOn and on, I rap 'til my mic's worn, torn, done son\nYou're unreal, just like a unicorn\nYou make me sick when you contradict\nIf you diss me or piss me off I'mma stomp you quick, slick", "year": "2017-09-18"}]}
