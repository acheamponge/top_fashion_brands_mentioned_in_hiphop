She just whispers in my ear, \"I'm with you\"\nI'm the type of dude that sends your baby momma out for food\nAnd I also like her throat action with a passion\nLove in her mouth for dental satisfaction\nThat means I hit the head like Greg Louganis then I'm splashing\nUgh, bust one back in the 'Lac stabbing (Hootie hoo!)\nShe knows what's happening, there's no reason to doubt it\nIf you ask her how I got it she say, \"How he had went about it was\"\nAnd then you wake up from a bad dream\nA nightmare, settle down, 'cause she right there\n\n[Hook: T.I. & Big Boi]\nShe said her name was Tangerine, damn, the American Dream\nShe all about her fucking cream, shake it like a tambourine\nShake it like a tambourine, she shake it like a tambourine\nShake it like a tambourine, she shake it like a tambourine\nShe said her name was Billie Jean, said she wanna show me things\nI pulled out a stack of green, shake it like a tambourine\nShake it like a tambourine, shake it like a tambourine\nShake it like a tambourine, shake it like a tambourine\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nOkay, midnight, fit like four or five chicks\nIn the drop 66, bumpin' Southernplayalistic\nYeah, we riding through the city like Monday Magic City Nights (Hey)\nPass dees around, momentarily they feeling like (Okay)\nGetting right, good girls got them getting busy like (Yeah)\nBig dykes, eating so much pussy they forget pipe (What about me?)\nAll got boyfriends, tell me they don't hit it right\nThey come see me so they can come be freaks\nIn the backseat, everything fast like a track meet\nAll I can see is titties, pussy lips, and ass cheeks\nActually, no exaggeration, no imagining\nReal talk, my reality is your fantasy (Yuh)\nKeisha, Kim, Tameka, Shay, Alisha and Gloria\nChasing this broad tryna find euphoria (Gotta find, ayy)\nName notorious (What?), dick game glorious (What?)\nFind me shorty when your boyfriend boring ya (Ayy, ayy)\n\n[Hook 2: Big Boi & Khujo]\nShake it like some Texas Pete dropping on your collard greens\nMake it hotter and she want a dollar do you follow me?\nShake it like a tambourine, shake it like a tambourine\nShake it like a tambourine, shake it like a tambourine\nSmelling like some tangerines, rolling like she on some beans\nGarter belt full of green, booty busting out the seams\nShake it like a tambourine, she shake it like a tambourine\nShake it like a tambourine, about to shake it like a tambourine (Okay...)\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nOnce upon a rhyme I knew this girl and she was fine\nAs everything outdoors, the kinda girl I describe her\nLike...
