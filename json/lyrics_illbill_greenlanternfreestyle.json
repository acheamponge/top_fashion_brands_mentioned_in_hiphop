We all want money, drugs, and bitches\nLet\u2019s keep it real, even television\u2019s a drug\nIf weed is a drug a Green Lantern CD is a drug\nI speaks in tongues, my peeps is all thieves and thugs\nCreeps with guns, Crips, Latin Kings, and Bloods\nWe generous with the heat but we cheap with love\nArrest me? Never that, the police is dumb\nI was born to die, walk around high\nThis piece of shit planet got my mind designed to rhyme about the madness\nClosed caskets, prostitutes and crack heads\nWe battle much, respect the cash gets, been a savage ever since\nRead a lot of books, threw a lot of right hooks, stuck up a lot of crooks\nI represent Brooklyn when I\u2019m out the hood\nNow the whole world\u2019s captivated, gang related\nSee me in my video being assassinated\nI\u2019m like the seventies when everybody sniff coke\nSlit throats, spit quotes, expensive like mink coats\nWhy I\u2019m so fucked up only my shrink knows\nDr. Tenenbaum, a small guy with a big nose\nI\u2019ve seen it all in my short life, me and my peeps is all trife\nIf we ain\u2019t sticking your moms then we fucking your wife\nIf it ain\u2019t weed in my blunts then there\u2019s dust in my pipe\nIf it ain\u2019t slugs in my guns then there\u2019s blood on my knife\nI put you to sleep, now you just a cousin of life\nIll Bill motherfucker make you jump in a fight\nThis is for the streets, I could give a fuck what you like\nEven my freestyles could fuck up any shit that you write", "image": "https://images.genius.com/74405ef5872d3bb65f9a7d3facb362ff.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "Howie Made Me Do It", "year": "2003-02-11"}]}
