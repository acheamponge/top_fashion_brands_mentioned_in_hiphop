Skrrt)\nGive me some time and give me your patience (Patience)\nCame in the game last month, fuck the game, I'm done (I'm done)\nGive me a sign and I'm gonna take it (Ahh)\nWhatever way I want, bitch, I get paid up front (Clout, clout)\nI'm gettin' mine, so fuck all your placements (Fuck)\nBaby face, I'm young, fuck the place I'm from (Place I'm from)\nDon't hit my line and say somethin' basic (Skrrt..rrrt)\nIf it ain't about the money, please don't waste no time (Waste no time)\nLookin' out the edge, and I'm picturin' the fall 'cause\nI don't want to break my legs and have to carry on (Hey)\nIf I carry on I'm gon' need some marijuana\nPut it in my bong, then I make another song\n\n[Outro: MTV interview with Kurt Cobain, 1993]\n\"May as well become a junkie because I felt like a junkie everyday, ya'know? Waking up starving, just forcing myself to eat, ya'know, barfing it back up.. it's like.. I'm in pain all the time.\""}], "artist": "Lil Peep"}
