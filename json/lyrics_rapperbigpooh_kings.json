hail from Freedom Hill, on my feet, I stand\nAnd what used to be Fila's and Reebok's, damn\nI would meet you at the weed spot where we got grams\nEnough, Doc couldn't detox, so need I plan\nTo squeeze off, man, if we not fam\nAnd let 'em die for ever tryin' to calcify my pineal gland\nYeah, they rap like fajitas but chica's fan of whose?\nGettin' more play like the east side band, ya heard\nShe likes diction, a lot of words\nNon-fiction, a bad boy pissed and who fly the bird\nIf he a Christian, what is this, he got the Earth\n93 million miles away, Glock in her purse\nAhk' got the nerve, yeah, I know I ought to serve\nEverybody lookin' for a fix, if I got the work\nThis is not a curse, chip on my collared shirt\nBless manifest my destiny, yep, without the church\nAmen, whose son's makin' a livin'?\nDone chasin' the chicken but stashed cake in the kitchen\nSome hated, we kick it, these bums basically sickened\nNot a part of my body, God, too big for trippin', huh\nMy alibi, tell them I was high when you seen me\nResurrect Malcolm X, raise my Kundalini\nGenocide couldn't pry me out the black beanie\nStill tapped the bottle of Moscato, watch the genie\n\n[Hook: Jalen Santoy]\nHallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah\nPraise to Gandhi, you gon' have to praise the shooter\nHallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah\nPraise to Gandhi, you gon' have to praise the shooter\nHallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah\nPraise to Gandhi, you gon' have to praise the shooter\nHallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah\nPraise to Gandhi, you gon' have to praise the shooter\n\n[Verse 2: Lute]\nWhile YouTube got niggas fooled \u2014 fuck the nae-nae\nI'm just tryin' to get us-us free like Cinque\nWhole lot of followers, a lot less leading\nWhen y'all niggas gon' realize you can't hashtag freedom\n#FreeMyNigga when you know he did it\nMake us look ign'ant, don't air his business\nAs a culture, now we back where we started, all over\nWhile niggas in the club predict rain like Al Roker\nI'm just tryin' to get us on track like locomotives\nClutch your soul, like, what's the motive?\nI just hope you remain focused on what the goal is\nGod body, young Marcus Garvey, my mama said\nHood's prophet, I'm hood's topic\n2 years later, I still got it, fuck the street cred\nIn the '86 Cutlass bumpin' Jeezy\nHoller at your boy if you ever need me\n'Cause I'm gone, maybe off the liquor\nOr maybe in the '86 Caprice with a lift kit\nEither way it goes, I'm lifted\nWhile niggas iced out to the T like they Lipton\nDumbin' down their lyrics just to get some recognition\nI'll be in the booth like Craig Mack kickin' flavor in your system\nUh, or better yet, your eardrum\nFuck the metaphors, hope the truth make you listen\n\n[Hook: Jalen Santoy]\nHallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah\nPraise to Gandhi, you gon' have to praise the shooter\nHallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah\nPraise to Gandhi, you gon' have to praise the shooter\nHallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah\nPraise to Gandhi, you gon' have to praise the shooter\nHallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah\nPraise to Gandhi, you gon' have to praise the shooter\n\n[Verse 3: Jalen Santoy]\nHallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah\nWe praise to Gandhi, you gon' have to praise the shooter\nSo hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah\nWe praise to Gandhi, you gon' have to praise the shooter\nIf it's to be, it's up to me, I think I figured that\nMost y'all started rappin' 'cause you heard that's where the figures at\nTryin' to change the game like Three 6 before the Oscars\nKnowin' I'm poppin' and keep it going, no show-stoppin'\nI'm more like Vlade in LA, you know, without the floppin'\nVintage game but it's all the same, still point droppin'\nInterview with Ahmad, then hit up Lauryn, get it poppin'\nIt's crazy, she used to stop in, never stay and leave you talkin'\nTopics I'm okay with sharin' now\nBefore they didn't think about it, guess who carin' now\n'Cause they favorite rapper been slackin', I'll go and then put a track in\nDemolish y'all polished flows that was keepin' they fans attracted\nI did, don't speak on it, karma keep me repentin'\nMade mistakes and now my plate look like a big pile of spinach\nToo strong, had to move on, the city say I'm due on\nBeen at it for some years, we eatin' free without a coupon\nYour daughter door like Groupon, been off that shit\nSuggest you go and get a job and try to catch up quick\nDealin' with Jazmin last night on some catch up shit\nShe thinkin' I done changin' young and grown up quick, so I split\n\n[Hook: Jalen Santoy]\nHallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah\nPraise to Gandhi, you gon' have to praise the shooter\nHallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah\nPraise to Gandhi, you gon' have to praise the shooter\nHallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah\nPraise to Gandhi, you gon' have to praise the shooter\nHallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah\nPraise to Gandhi, you gon' have to praise the shooter\n\n[Verse 4: Rapper Big Pooh]\nYeah, it's that joint that make your head nod\nRest in peace, Big Pun, this my terror squad\nY'all don't want me on your songs, it's the fear of God\nI remember when they said my verses weren't hard\nNow what's the motive? I'm tryin' to cop the Lotus\nDrivin' 'round town, wave my hand like the POTUS\nFat boy, larger than life, they all notice\nWhen niggas think you on, they linin' up to be your soldiers\nBut bein' broke is like wakin' up with Folgers\nTurn the lights on, you watchin' roaches\nI swore I wouldn't change, spent my money on material things\nMe and my niggas roll tough like we started a gang\nFucked a couple broads once, now they callin' to hang\nDho told me, \"Let 'em be if they don't call you by name\"\nFloor seats, Madison Square, just catchin' the game\nWhen they scared to give you props, they just call you a acclaimed \u2014 fuck that!"}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
