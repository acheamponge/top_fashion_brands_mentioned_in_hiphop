I had every sneaker so\nI'm that nigga, my nigga\nSomethin' you need to know\nDon't talk, everything I don't need to know\nTavern on the green, Papaya where I treat a ho\nI'm a criminal, heroin no chemicals\nNiggas know my name, I don't deal with subliminals\nMy niggas knocked, they'll spit in ya face\nLaw library, looking for a glitch in the case\nSit in ya place, before you get a stitch in your face\nA number to his ass, get him erased\nThat toolie fly, no piece\nMoolie die, no grief\nYou cool? we cool\nCoolie high, cochese\nLooking like a bowl of sugar, so sweet\nThinking bout what you look like, no teeth\nSo get right, noon to midnight\nWrist bright, kill em with the blade on my swiss knife\n\n\n[Hook: Vado]\nCars, boats, clothes\nJust to name a few\nStars, coke, hoes\nYea they hang with you\nEvery feature presented\nWe album painted true\nY'all niggas is sick wit it\nWe make y'all faces blue\n\n[Verse 2: Vado]\nOohs and aahhs\nYes y'all\nI confess y'all\nNo homo but every bar, niggas head nod\nTap the sky like, like no lie\nThe next y'all\nExpensive fly, like a shop in a jet mall *Vado*\nWhen I touch mics, the kid bout it\nWas up nights, with fluff white\nI spit about it\nGTR, pick up nights the feel about it\nIf that's your wife, I fucked twice, forget about it!\nSmall thing to a giant\nKnown for breaking down small things to a client\n4 pound, a small things in the iron\nFucked what could have been a small thing but you lyin'\nIt's no comparison, confident\nA lot of arrogance\nBattle me? Let me save you from the embarrassment\nYou average, just a kid\nI'm the mavericks\nYou play for me, take a seat at my establishment\n\n[Hook: Vado]"}]}
