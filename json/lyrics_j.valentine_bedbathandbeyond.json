Valentine & Chris Brown]\nOh, this is for my baby though, this one's for my baby though\nOh, this is for my baby though, this one's for my baby though\nTurn it up right now, now, now\nLet it bring your body on down, down, down\nTurn it up right now, now, now\nLet it bring your body on down, down, down\n\n[Verse 1: J. Valentine]\nI\u2019m looking at you like you\u2019s a star\n'Cause you\u2019re shining in the dark\nGo on and tell me every day with her\nI'll go there and put in work\nGiving you what you deserve\n\n[Pre-Chorus: J. Valentine]\nI\u2019ll do everything that I say I would\nMake your body feel, like you never could\nIf you follow me, girl, I swear I won\u2019t lead you on\nWhen we get home\n\n[Chorus: J. Valentine]\nI\u2019m gonna lay you down, turn you around\nWanna make love all over this house\nBaby, from the bed to the bath and beyond\nHowever you like it\nI\u2019ma hit the spot 'til you can\u2019t take no more\nGoing in, like I never, ever did before\nFrom the bed to the bath and beyond!\nHowever you like it, girl\n\n[Verse 2: Chris Brown]\nI bet you never had a man like me\nThat\u2019s gon' make your body feel this way\nI\u2019ll pull you closer even when you say no\nSo baby, let me take control now!\n\n[Pre-Chorus: J. Valentine & Chris Brown]\nI\u2019ll do everything that I say I would\nMake your body feel, like you never could\nIf you follow me, girl, I swear I won\u2019t lead you on\nWhen we get home\n\n[Chorus: J. Valentine & Chris Brown]\nI\u2019m gonna lay you down, turn you around\nWanna make love all over this house\nBaby, from the bed to the bath and beyond\nHowever you like it\nI\u2019ma hit the spot 'til you can\u2019t take no more\nGoing in, like I never, ever did before\nFrom the bed to the bath and beyond!\nHowever you like it, girl\n\n[Bridge: J. Valentine & Chris Brown]\nI know you tired of laying on the bed\nWe can stay here on the floor\nWe don\u2019t need no lingerie\nJust put your naked body on\nYou know I like it when your hair gets wet\nGirl, I\u2019m gon' turn this shower on\nSo let\u2019s reinvent love making\nI\u2019ll drive you crazy\n\n[Chorus: J. Valentine & Chris Brown]\nI\u2019m gonna lay you down, turn you around\nWanna make love all over this house\nBaby, from the bed to the bath and beyond\nHowever you like it\nI\u2019ma hit the spot 'til you can\u2019t take no more\nGoing in, like I never, ever did before\nFrom the bed to the bath and beyond!\nHowever you like it, girl"}], "artist": "J.
