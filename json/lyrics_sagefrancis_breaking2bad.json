Seriously\nWalter White: Why do you do it?\nJesse: Money. Mainly\nWalter: There you go\nJesse: Nah, come on, man\nJesse: What?!\n\n[Verse 1: B. Dolan]\nNow let me say a little prayer before we eat\nThis is dedicated to the news that we delete\nAssociated guilt, bye bye, sucker freeways\nHard time rumbling, you wonder how we sleep\nI\u2019ll tell you: the answer is seldom and lightly\nRecord by the head, ball pen right beside me\nYou could choose one if you feel lucky\nEither way you\u2019re losing, it\u2019s too bad you fucked up, dummy\n\n[Hook: Sage]\nTough titties said the kitty\n(Epic Beard Men! No pity!) No!\nAs an emcee it doesn\u2019t matter how important being modest is\nI hold this \u2026 arrogance over you Donovans\nI\u2019m Quasimodo, pseudo-mono, semi-automatic\nI challenge a 40-ounce to my 4.0\nYou left crews battered, cut up, and bloody\nToo bad (Too bad you fucked up, dummy!)\n\nWalter: I\u2019m thinking maybe you and I could partner up\nJesse: Sage, you and me?\nWalter: That\u2019s right\nJesse: Sage\u2026\n\n[Verse 2: Sage and B. Dolan]\nOne for the one who couldn\u2019t slow his roll\nTwo for the crews who broke up on the road\nThree for the plea you copped and got old\nBut that was a long time ago\n\n[Sage]\nI\u2019m not wasting time pushing my CDs to stores\nI\u2019m too busy just convincing people not to buy yours\nI cock block, I black ball, no pause, no stalls\nBrother B. Dolan got a story for y\u2019all:\n\n[B. Dolan]\nNow once upon a time not too long ago\nA local opener or two played the fool in a show\nDude, how you in the dressing room touching my shit?\nI\u2019m living out of that suitcase, you\u2019re leaning on it\nAnd every drink that you leave down next to my laptop\nI think about stomping your teeth into the blacktop\nFifteen minutes over time (Oh hell no!)\nAnd came back stage looking for dap, holding demos\nI paid you a compliment, you asking about money too much\n(Too soon) Too puffed-up, sonny (Too gas)\nToo high (too funny) Too few paid dues\nDo you, little bunny\n\nYo, it\u2019s just too bad you fucked up, dummy\nToo bad you fucked up, dummy (\u201cOh well\u201d)\nToo bad you fucked up, dummy\nToo bad you fucked up, dummy\n\nWalter: Did you learn nothing from my chemistry class?\nJesse: No. You fucked me. Remember? Prick. And let me tell you something else: This ain\u2019t chemistry. Okay? This is art\nWalter: Oh ho ho. I saw your setup. It was ridiculous. You and I will not make garbage\nJesse: Yeah, well, we\u2019ll see about that\n\nToo bad you fucked up, dummy\nToo bad you fucked up, dummy\nToo bad you fucked up, dummy\n\nWalter: You know the business. (\u201cStrange Famous!\u201d) And I know the chemistry", "album": "Sick to D(eat)h"}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
