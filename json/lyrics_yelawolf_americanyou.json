Old pair of shoes\nNever wear your heart on your sleeve\nCause it don't go with the suit\nYou got a bad, bad woman with a young little pretty face\nThey told you not to go get married\nBut you went and did it anyway\n\n[Chorus]\nSingin', oh sweet sounds of American you\nNever miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos\nEvery time we drive by wavin', I see right through\nDoo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too\n\n[Verse 2]\nMama said steer clear of the devil\nSo you never played in the road\nAlways lookin' on the bright side\nSo you never see the potholes\nYou got a house on a hill\nBig news, that's a big deal\nBig party with your big time friends\nMan, imagine how that feels\n\n[Chorus]\nSingin', oh sweet sounds of American you\nNever miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos\nEvery time we drive by wavin', I see right through\nDoo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too\nDoo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too\n\n[Verse 3]\nI believe in the modest dream, ain't lookin' for a pot of gold\nA 6 pack and some good marijuana, I can watch my mama roll\nI believe I could buy a few things like a house with a nice pool\nInvite my nobody friends to the party and we\u2019ll pee in it, fuck you\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou got a blue-collar father who drinks Budweiser out the bottle\n20 dollars, an old Impala, a baby's mama\nYou work hard, you don't beg, you don't borrow\nNight at the factory, daytime job at McDonald's\nYour daddy told you that girl was nothin' but a problem\nBut you fell in love 'cause to you she was like a supermodel\nAnd they told you not to go get married\nBut you went and did it anyway\nIt ain't no problem\nYou make somethin' out of nothin', you make money for a livin'\nPushin' buttons, diggin' ditches, flippin' burgers in the kitchen\nWith the vision, you've been dreamin', you've been savin'\nYou've been given nothin' but shit\nBut you take it cause you're patient in this prison\nFuck everybody dissin', it ain't them who gotta live in this skin\nWith all these tattoos that you got that fuckin' offends them\nIf it's you that I'm speakin' to, you must be my extension\nI take my drink up and sip it, take my hat off and tip it\nSlumerican\n\n[Chorus]\nOh sweet sounds of American you\nNever miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos\nEvery time we drive by wavin', I see right through\nDoo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too\nDoo doo doo doo doo doo, fuck you too", "title": "American You"}]}
