Gotta be a hole in my heart\nEvery once in a while it squirts\nEvery once in a while I got to check to see if it works\nNext to me, evil lurks\nTrying to get that monkey off my back\nPut in evil kneevle work\nTake Chances, Tango with death dances\nAngle the Tech blasted\nAngel with death asthma\nI had a best friend that couldn't even last\nCuz fame had to send a choke hold, fuckin bastard\nPut the lock down on the local, then I passed it\nI'm one psychotic can't remember my middle name or my last one\nYou can ask her it deteriorates faster & as the\nWorld turn my heart burns to ashes as if\nAt my age I could last it\nIt's my page & it ain't\nPaper or Plastic, &\nThat's it\n\n[Hook]", "year": null, "album": null}], "artist": "Brotha Lynch Hung"}
