Kelly and Bill Cosby\nWho still probably got lil' girls in the Hills lobby\nAnd these supposed to be our heroes? Negro, please\nOld niggas unreliable like D-Rose knees\nOnly man I can trust is G-O-D\nNot to mention Mos Def and Talib Kweli\nNow I get it, y'all think new niggas really suck\nAnd white kids fuckin' love it, lil' silly ducks\nBut I know it's a lot of bullshit goin' on\nI understand, but please, don't complain without a plan\nIronically I wrote this whole song off a xan, nah I'm playin'\nI'm just tryna be a fuckin' man\nWe see you old niggas as a lot of clowns\nNot to mention, our father figures was not around\nSo we all on tours and we hoppin' towns\nWe just need to sit down and find common ground\nAnd it's soon to come, soon to come\nHip-hop need balance like the moon and sun\nIt feel good when I wear Christian Louboutins\nSo I gotta drop music to accrue some funds\nAnd I get it, that's the mindset that's killin' the rhyme-fest\nBut feedin' our families, lowering the crime, yet\nYou want us to be separate and make a contest\nRappin' to stay up out the streets, shouldn't mind that\nStayin' out of prison and we sayin' fuck the system, man\nRappin' is an outlet to go and get our dividends\nRather than out robbin' niggas, sellin' Ritalin\nOld niggas bitter, y'all should love it when a nigga win\n'Cause we came from the same struggle\nLike Diddy and Dame Russell\nWas teachin' and gained hustle, got rich, remained subtle\nSee, I listen, see, I listen\nBut Lil Dae-Dae water-whippin' in the kitchen\nReady to flip a pack and bring it back, no submission\nGotta just go attack Lil Pump when you're dissin'\nI understand both sides of the Ziploc\nY'all old niggas' time is comin', nigga, tick-tock\nI'ma still wear all my Gucci flip-flops\nAnd the fuckin' diamond chain with the big rocks\nAnd I'll be the greatest ever, nigga, just watch\nCardi B got rich from Love & Hip Hop, haha", "title": "Old Niggas"}]}
