Lord, its your boy... so I trip, 'cause I don't even expect to be here Lord. Honestly I didn't even seek it out it seems, but, I understand what you said in 1 Corinthians 5:20, Lord, you called us to be your ambassdors so, I know this can glorify you. But Lord I pray I die to myself Lord. Even if they don't like it Lord. Or even if they love it, I pray I die to myself Lord. Because I know, this glorifies you, so use this for your glory Lord,, use this as I die to myself, in Jesus name Lord, amen"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
