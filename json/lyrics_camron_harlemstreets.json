(Killa!), Dipset, man\nAyo you know I've been all over the motherfucking world, man\nBut ain't no place like Harlem, man\nLet me break it down, man\n\n[Verse 1]\nWe tie dynamite to the rhino type, wino might find yo' sight\nSell the information for a dime of white, that China-China\nI'm behind the diner, selling marijuana to a minor-miner\nElder fella; looking for that shine? I'll shine ya\nMy mind designer. You a dime? I'll dine ya\nMadonna momma, body bottled, you're fine. I'm finer\nTime to climb her, climb behind vagina\nThen I hymen-grind her 'til her mom remind her\nDiamonds blind her; vision's gone, kiss her palm\nTurn her arm, lift her arm, notice that her wrists is raw\n\"Gotta get it right ma, we gon' get along\"\nSaid \"how?\" \"don't trip,\" but, yo, the trick is wrong\nFirst visi-on, day job tick-a-tron\nNighttime, Mr. Mom, bootleg Cris' and Dom\nBrother Chris and Don, and their sister Carm\nThey sell yey, you'll say \"yay, this shit's the bomb\"\nI'ma hit my man, tell 'em you my pick upon\nThe rest, so yes, you'll be blessed to hit the intercom\nYou know, kiss his mom, she gave him wisdom charm\nAnd their father come from a long list of dons\nAnd I get it cheaper, I cop bricks like sneakers\nAnd if the cops come, I just hit amnesia\nBut I give you an earful, it's tearful\nTold my mother I hustle and she said \"be careful\"\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy I feel like I'm losing weight?\nWhy I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight?\nMy life's based upon what I'ma do this year\nCop a boat, cop a Lear\nNow the army suit's cute with my chocolate Airs\nYou ain't gotta stare, go cop a pair\nStill the scrutiny, nothing they can do to me\nI made sure my mother and girl is smothered in pearls\nWhen a nigga under the world (Killa!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nEverybody like, \"Cam got the recipe now!\"\nNot them 3 girls I got to be Destiny's Child (gotta be me)\nSpecially equities, reckon we smile\nInterfere, tech to tech and use the TEC that we wile\nDetective deceptive, receptive of fouls\nHectic, Heckler & Koch\nHelicopters on the set of my sales\nNah, I ain't gonna be embedded in jail\nTalking to a cellmate in a bed in a jail, dog\nI broke bread with the whale, fled from some seals\nAnd the house, I was the head of the hills, shit\nYou get a dumb ho, and get dumb-happy\nGo to the gun show, get gun-happy (who are we?)\nStuck, killed, mugged, milled\nTone, flint, sticks, bo, Chub's milk (what up, y'all)\nPucci baba, but I got the hardest shells\nWe the Midwest gun cartel, nigga\nYa, we'll just clap up your brains, snatch up your chains\nSee dog? Rap is my aim\nBut I'm a hustler, in my heart, trapped is the game\nAttached to my frame, tapped to my brain, the fact still remains:\nIt wasn't rap, it was crack that got the racks on the Range\nLook dog, don't be asking for Dame, see\nPlayboy, I don't own that man\nAnd anyway, homeboy, you a grown-ass man, shit\nAnd when I rap it ain't no punchline (not at all)\nI be on the highway dirty, crunch time\nNo timeouts homeboy, just one time\nIf they find that stash box just one time\nShit, they'll put the dogs in the truck\nSide of the road, holding you up, you cold as fuck\nThey want that button, lunge it and push it\nSoon as they lunge it and push it, I run in the bushes\nThat's how I play mine, jump over the grapevine\nTake my chances one-on-one with the K9\nSteel and a clip for anyone squealing they lips\nFuck y'all if y'all ain't feeling the Dips (Killa, Killa!)\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy I feel like I'm losing weight?\nWhy I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight?\nMy life's based upon what I'ma do this year\nCop a boat, cop a Lear\nNow the army suit's cute with my chocolate Airs\nYou ain't gotta stare, go cop a pair\nStill the scrutiny, nothing they can do to me\nI made sure my mother and girl is smothered in pearls\nWhen a nigga under the world (Killa!)"}]}
