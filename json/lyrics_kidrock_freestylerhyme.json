(no)\nSome people just don't get it\nThey got no talent so they hide behind a gimmick\nAnd rock with it\nIt's a shame, but who's to blame\nI got a C note brain, steel veins\nI got love for everyone\nJust don't get dumb, cause if ya get dumb, ya get done\nFrom the jimmy to the beach, to the bum\nFrom the fist, to the bat, to a gat to the hand grenades\nYou can't fade me, I'm down for mine\nAnd the hate in the world, is the sign of the times\nLet me lay it on the line\nI'm just another kid with the freestyle rhyme\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow I'm the highest, flyest emcee in town\nThe scratchinist, most smackinest emcee around\nHeaven senting, representing always\nYour on MTV, radio, game all crazed\nI blaze spliffs, drink, 45 OZ's\nGot the lady's breaking with thie strip-tease\n24 on a 12 step relapse\nFillin' ? and empty knee caps\nI'll be back if i don't make green\nWith the funky rhymes and the no sell out themes\nI have dreams and aspirations\nMy graduation, was from pimp of the county to pimp of the nation\nDamnation is shocking signs\nFrom the Kid Rock flows, to the free style rhymes"}]}
