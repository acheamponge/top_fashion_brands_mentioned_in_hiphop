Y\u2019all givin\u2019 me a clap.\nA yes is fine (laughing) ok?\n(voice from audience \u201cI love that song\u201d)\nThank you. Praise God.\n\nI tell you, I know everybody\u2019s in the same mess. I\u2019m telling you.\nWe all are.\nI, I, I know that, you know...\nand I\u2019m just, you know, I\u2019ll be the first to tell you, you know,\nI\u2019m a mess and God is dealing with me everyday. And everyday I\u2019m trying, you know, how I can be less of a mess. Cuz you know, he showed me, Look Lauryn, you know, You\u2019re the problem, ok, I\u2019m going to show you how you\u2019re causing the problem, and now I want you to be the solution. And that\u2019s what all of these songs are about, just, problem, cause and solution. Free your mind.\n\nIt\u2019s like, we all think that the gospel is join and church building, and that\u2019s deception, you know.\nThe real gospel is Repent, which means \u2018let go of all that crap,\u2019 that\u2019s killin\u2019 you.\nLife was supposed to be a pleasurable experience, not this torment, you know.\nAnd when I realized that I was tormenting myself, it was about my lust.\nIt wasn\u2019t about things that I needed it was just, you know, all these security blankets. I mean, the more I acquired I became more of a prisoner. I mean, you know, forty people on staff, and you can\u2019t do nothing, and now creativity is impossible because all you can think about is all these folks that you know, you\u2019re supporting and carryin\u2019 and you know, it\u2019s not good. You know, everybody\u2026\na friend of mine says that every tub has to stand on it\u2019s own bottom, you know. And in that respect, we all get to do what our passion is.\nSee , that\u2019s what praisin God is all about, is doing your passion.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s not useless, worthless ritual, you know, monotonous ritual, where we just show up and can\u2019t wait to see the game, you know. It\u2019s doing your passion and fulfilling your passion. You know.\nThat\u2019s how we\u2019re thankful. That\u2019s how we say we appreciate the opportunity to be alive.\n\nAnd I\u2019m just glad that I, you know, I don\u2019t have to slave anymore. You know, cuz I, music was my love, and because of everything I thought had to accompany my music it became my burden. It just got stolen from me. I said, What is this? How did this thing that I love so much so easily and so quickly turn to something I loath and hate?\nAnd so now, you know, I understand that it was because I was measuring myself or trying to compare myself to a standard that wasn\u2019t reality. It wasn\u2019t the standard at all, you know. T\nhere\u2019s a scripture in the Bible that we, what does it say, it says \u2018We compare ourselves amongst ourselves\u2019 you know. That\u2019s not the standard. You already are the standard. What are you trying to fit into a standard for? We were each created to be individual standards, you know. And we\u2019re trying to fit into a standard? It doesn\u2019t make any sense, you know.\n\nSo now I\u2019m just, you know, after all that, I\u2019m just ready to be me. And it\u2019s a lot to work through, you know, because all of us have hidden in these little boxes purposely, because of parts of ourselves that we were unhappy about. And it\u2019s because we didn\u2019t understand, you know, because there\u2019s all this social doctrine that says, you know, that\nThe infinite God, with all this expression,\nwho created every single one of us,\nabsolutely different,\nOn purpose,\nwants everybody to fit into the same suit.\nBut like, you know, that\u2019s deception.\nThat\u2019s deception.\n\n(Talking to someone offstage) Ok, let me just, I think this is the wrong one (laughing) I don\u2019t think this is the right one.\n\nWe took\u2026we were in, um, Florida this weekend and we took the kids to Disney world, and um, you know we were going, they gave us a tour. They escorted us through the back. And when they escorted us through the back, we got to see how, you know, there all these people workin all hard, and it was like, real dirty back there, and of course, in the front it was all immaculately clean.\nAnd I said, I said, you know, People need to see the reality, they need to see, you know, how these people slave to maintain this illusion.\nAnd it felt like my life. I said, If people only knew what it was.\n\nIt\u2019s like, you know, a bunch of musicians, listen, bustin\u2019 their \u2018mm\u2019 workin all hard to make it look easy. What\u2019s the point? You know, Oh, uh, I just threw this together, uh\u2026(audience laughs).\nYou know, it\u2019s like, you know what I\u2019m sayin?\nI mean, you know.\nSlaving.\nSlaving to act like, you know, I wake up like this. And none of us do, you know, none of us do.\nNone of us do.\nAnd reality is good cuz that means everybody could just exhale, let your belly out, you know, and chill. You know. But people get mad at me when I say, Look, let\u2019s stop frontin\u2019. And I\u2019m saying, you know, that\u2019s the blessing.\nNow we can go around and look at each other and say, Oh, you got one too?!\n\nAnd be free.\n\nAnd we want to defend the curse. I\u2019ll tell ya, that was not fun. Did it for a long time...\n\nToo long.\n(offstage) You didn\u2019t find it? It\u2019s another white one. But you see\u2026in my purse. Or the, the other bag? Or the green one? Ghetto. You know, it\u2019s reality, ok (laughing)?\n\nOne time, it came to me, you know, I was just told very concretely.\nYou know, it was like that voice, the right one, said to me,\nhe said, Lauryn, You know the real you is more interesting than the fake somebody else.\nI just want you to know that.\n\nBecause we always thought we could get, you know, we could get reality by just putting on the clothes and wearin\u2019 the face and you know, lookin hard in the video. But, you know. Reality is..it\u2019s like I\u2019ve always told to my husband, it\u2019s like, look, you know, we look at Bob Marley, you know, and we say Ok, let\u2019s just grow locks and wear the clothes and have the band and we have no many idea how many years of struggle and pain and suffering that made that content. You see what I\u2019m saying?\n\nYou can\u2019t get it from the outside in. Truth is from the inside out.\n\nYou know, and the way we\u2019ve been trying to heal and be healed is with these topical, surface, superficial, temporary solution. And I\u2019m telling you, true healing is from the inside out. You know, we\u2019ve been told to protect our outer man while our inner man is dying. (offstage) Oh, this is the one.\n\nBoy I\u2019ll tell ya, God made him for me. I\u2019m something to put up with. And to endure that is amazing. I\u2019ll be the first to tell you, trust me. Y\u2019all could clap cuz that\u2019s some real work (more clapping). I was in there in the room, you know, before we came out here, and he said to me, I said, Ro should I change? And he said, Yeah. So I looked at him, I said, Why did you tell me to change I was comfortable, man. But I asked him the question. So I went in the room and I tried on all these clothes and I was like, I feel like an idiot. So I pulled out all these clothes and I\u2019m sayin, ok Ro, you know, Pack the bag neatly, you know, Could you put the clothes back in? And he\u2019s like, Alright. So he\u2019s trying to do this but then I\u2019m like, No! Now take this out! Now put that back and take that out! Put that back, hold that, take, that, put, The orange shoe! The orange shoe! So I\u2019m like. And then after awhile I just said, Ro baby, could you leave? Please get out the room. And I just put back on the clothes I came in. Ok, I was like\u2026I\u2019m just not there anymore. Nah, I\u2019m telling you. It\u2019s like, uh (laughing). Hey you know he\u2019s learned. Because before we used to just beef and now he\u2019s like, Okay\u2026I\u2019m out. It\u2019s real. God gave us a brand new relationship, man, I mean, one in truth, you know.\n\nIt\u2019s like, we date people, like let\u2019s say, you know, we\u2019re interested in somebody and we put on the perfume and dress up and then we do things that we will never ever ever do again! You understand what I\u2019m sayin? It\u2019s like\u2026And that\u2019s why so many marriages end up in divorce. It\u2019s because people wake up next to a stranger.\nThey say, Who the hell are you? What are you doing in this bed?\nWhere\u2019s that man that used to do \u2018du, dua, and du.\u2019\nAnd I\u2019m sayin let\u2019s give them reality from the door because: you\u2019re going to attract love,\nand the one that really loves you. And then you don\u2019t have to pretend and falsify, and you know, keep that posture.\n\nYou know, you know, I can\u2019t, I\u2019m just like...I\u2019ll never forget when I first met him I said to him, it was like, he saw me eating in front of him, and he told me, he was like, You eat like a man, you must not like me. You know, because, women, usually they keep that posture. And I said, Nah. I said it\u2019s not even that, you know. It\u2019s but, this is reality. This is, you know, and that\u2019s it, man, I mean, I\u2019m just telling you, it\u2019s so wonderful to finally find\u2026\n\nAnd trust me, it\u2019s a work in progress, it\u2019s not something that happens overnight.\nWe all have to be introduced to each other.\n\nI\u2019m telling you, I know that I\u2019m up here and you see, Lauryn Hill, you came to see Lauryn Hill.\nBut this is the first time y\u2019all meet me. You see what I\u2019m saying? Don\u2019t think you met me before, ok. And as I grow, you\u2019re going to meet me a little bit more. You\u2019re gonna be exposed to the real me a little bit more. I can tell you I had to reintroduce myself to everybody I know. My mother my father. Listen, y\u2019all never knew me. I want to introduce you to me. I\u2019m just getting to know me. And you know what, anything that\u2019s not growin' is dead, so we better be changing.\n\nYou know, people would say to me, they would hold me hostage. And they, seriously, emotionally hostage, and they\u2019d say, Uh, she\u2019s changing. The money\u2019s changing her. And I\u2019d say Listen, the money\u2019s not changing me, God\u2019s changing me. I\u2019m changing, because that\u2019s a natural part of life. We\u2019re all supposed to change. Who wakes up and is the same way tomorrow and the day after that? Nobody is. Let the experience teach you and be real, man.\n\nAnd, um..there\u2019s gonna be warfare involved. Because there\u2019s some people who prefer deceptions, see. They say, uh, I don\u2019t like this new expression, and I say, what, you want two-thirds of me to stay outside? I\u2019m a whole person. You can\u2019t say, you know, two-thirds of Lauryn, come in here. Only two-thirds is acceptable. I\u2019m a whole person. You know. And that\u2019s everybody.\n\nYou always talk about spiritual warfare and we didn\u2019t realize that it was in relationships. It\u2019s emotional warfare. Being able to tell the people we love the most the truth about ourselves. And when they say, Hey that doesn\u2019t fit into our box for you, we say, well, I ain\u2019t in no box. Don\u2019t try to put me in one.\n\nI\u2019m going to play a little bit of guitar with this one, but I might stop it\u2019s cuz I really want you to listen to the words, so if I stop, you understand why. I want you to really hear the words\u2026"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
