My first nation was called the imagination\nIn time, we became determination\nTo put substance in the perception of oneness\nSpinning spiral threads, creating a cosmic spider web\nTo catch wonders, in all planes of dimensions of matter\nCounters of information and data\nBalance of mental sensations we gathered\nThe carriers of light, through the triple stages of night\nThen I blew greatness into phrases that I write\nIn the land of Erech, when the madness entered\nOnly when the Father repented and the Sabbath ended\nThe land of Admah where Cain explained to a scribe\nWhat happen between him and his brother when he died\nHe smirk as he commanded his army to do drills in the dirt\nHe said, \"You know what really hurts, after you departure\nI really have nothing left\" and by the time I'm deceased\nI'll probably transform into the Angel of Death\nAnd re-enter your atmosphere, dragging angels by their hair\nFire and brimstone raining from his spheres\nBlood and crowns fallen while we sit on our horses\nAnd I laugh as I look at my family portrait\nI figure I found the first city\nAnd knowing in their heart, they showed pity\nWho want to rule the Earth with me?\nThe God of the Garden, the first son of Nod\nThe brotherhood of the marking\nDetached Lamech and Tubal-cain\nKill em, the removal of the brain\nThe land of cannibal, the mistaken me as an animal\nNow mistake me as Hannibal\nThousands of elephants impaled on the fence of Heaven\nThis mountain shaken the gates, I'll be a legend\nHe turned around, screaming \"victory\" to his brethren\nWhich turned into skeletons in seconds, he turned back\nHis flesh also melted in the face of the army presence\nNo weapon is formed\n\n[Break: Killah Priest]\nKings die\nGod's live on\nPlanet we on\n\n[Verse 2: Killah Priest]\nSo don't contest who's the best lyricist\nWhen you rhyme like from the futuristic time of period\nAlso you rhyme like you climbed out of a pyramid\nAnd you shine, like you returned from a pilgrimage\nOr a shrine, like the minds that designed the Book of Genesis\nAnd mankind, made in Our images\nWhen your message like the Epic of Gilgamesh\nWhen your imperfection is accepted, you're limitless\n\n[Outro: Killah Priest]\nI scared myself\nFor eons"}]}
