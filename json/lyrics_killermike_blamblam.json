street\nBlue your feet blue your seat\nHe who moves usually\nCool it be, slow your roll\nThese niggas here dey cool with me\nRock the same shoes as me\nWent to the same school as me\nNews would be\nThat these niggs I am tryin bring up on ya, I just called to let ya know\nYou need to keep the K up on ya\nChop up all these credit cards\nCareer is all that laid up on ya\nSkeet skeet\nMove fast don't let them bitches lay up on ya\nYou know you really wanna be rollin instead\nHey there some niggas out here tryin to put a hole in yo head\nHey and sold ya for bread\nFindin the life that we chose\nFast cars and this money\nAnd these trifling hoes\nKeep it real!\n\nWho wanna test-a the goon or the pride\nI keep it on my hips they call me onsly\nGo and let a few fly\nThat made a few die\nSome fell straight down others handglide\nBut none of them survive the rising of the tide\nDrown in they own blood\nLike pigs in the mud\nInsert a few buds\nMake sure he don't budge\nOr toss or throw away\nI don't hold a grudge\n\n[Chorus:]\nWhen the Glock go blam blam, (boom, boom)\nYou die you don't get jiggy done you're done done\nNo there's nowhere to hide nowhere to run run\nGrindtime

of chips\nWhodini and genie out of a bikini that's a magic trick\nAbra Kadabra, I caught it all on camera\n(While I)Amazing stamina\nFar from the amateurs\nSmokin lavender\nIt's slightly lighter than purple with a murk\nMy family matters but ain't no Urkels in my circle of trust\nAmongst eachother, we trust each brother\n\nThere's another mad situation\nSad situation\nThat every nigga I know is in a bad situation (Situation)\nI'm tired of waiting\nTired of being patient\nTired of waking up wondering if we gonna make it (gonna make it)\nMy hands are full\nI'm a Grindtime disciple\nRight hand the Bible\nLeft hand the rifle (a rifle)\nWe freed us boys\nAnd we both got degrees\nI got mine from the schools\nHe got his from the street\nTold me \"little nigga don't be like me\"(like me) yes I didn't listen no disrespecting he\n(now back to me)It's kind of sad\nThat that's all I want to be\nA member of the game\nRappin and using slang\nAnd even at career day\nI said the same thang\nTeacher shook her head\n\"What a god damn shame\"\nBut really motherfucker\nWho really should you blame\n(I am) a product of my environment\n(I am)Workin towards retirement\nJust another motherfucker\nTrying to come up\nHand above the water\nAnd Get head from your daughter\nBut who gives a fuck\nGo on and sign me up\nBig Slim in the building nigga throw ya G'z up!\n\n[Chorus:]\nWhen the Glock go blam
