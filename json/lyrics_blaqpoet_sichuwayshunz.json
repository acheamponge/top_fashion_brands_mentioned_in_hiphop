Yeah, I know that it is\nSo what, I even take candy from kids\nOn the mission without a pot to piss in\nHearing all kinds of voices, I'm tryin' not to listen\n\n[Hook, 2x:]\nIt don't matter\nThe shit that you're facin\nEverybody got their own situation\nIf you're livin in a mansion or a fuckin basement\nEverybody got their own situation\n\n[Verse 2]\nMaybe I should go to church and find god\nBefore i end up dead or behind bars\nLook for a legit job, quit the mob\nBefore the DA get some new shit to charge\nThe street's more than just watching us attacking\nEvery time i tryna leave, I find my way back in\nThe feds got my phone tapped, tryna peep\nWho's really my peeps, who's running the streets\nWife be mad, she's calling me a creep\nPaparazzi caught me on the beach with some freaks\nI can't worry about that right now\nA new family's in town, they tryna get down\n\n[Hook, 2x:]\nIt don't matter\nThe shit that you're facin\nEverybody got their own situation\nIf you're livin in a mansion or a fuckin basement\nEverybody got their own situation\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm just minding my business not bothering you\nLooking through the garbage can for some food\nLooking for a nice warm place to sleep\nGo down to the subway and bits to streets\nI gave up hope a long time ago\nStraight from the war, right the skid row\nI still hear people screaming in the dark\nI still smell the burned body parts\nI'm mentally unfit, but who gives a shit\nNot the government, not the president\nOnly time people care is on the holidays\nSo leave me alone and just let me go my way\nAnd be happy that you ain't me\nSome people are scared and some people hate me\nPeople fear what they don't understand\nWhat would you do if you was that homeless man?\n\n[Hook, 2x:]\nIt don't matter\nThe shit that you're facin\nEverybody got their own situation\nIf you're livin in a mansion or a fuckin basement\nEverybody got their own situation"}], "artist": "Blaq Poet"}
