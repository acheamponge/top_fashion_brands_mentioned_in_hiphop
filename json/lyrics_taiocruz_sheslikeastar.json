[x6]\n\n[Verse 1]\nShe's my everything, like a morning girl\nShe's my angel, up above my world\nShe's the only one, who understands me\nThat's why I call her, my new family\n\n[Hook]\nShe's the only one that I want by my side\nShe's the only one that I believe can save my life\nShe makes me wanna be a better man ohh why\nShe's higher then the sky, the suns and the moon\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby) [x4]\n\n[Verse 2]\nFirst let me say, she's the best of me\nIs it cliche, to say she's destiny\nThere's no one else but her, well at least for me\nThat's exactly why, I must now repeat\n\n[Hook]\nShe's the only one that I want by my side\nShe's the only one that I believe can save my life\nShe makes me wanna be a better man ohh why\nShe's higher then the sky, the suns and the moon\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby) [x4]\n\n[Bridge]\nShe's my star, my light, starry night\nAviator shades, cause she shine so bright\nBeats on the G5, songs I write\nJust so I can take her on a G5 flights\nYa she my type, just my height\nShe's my fit, she's just right\nShe's like, \u201cI think we might, go far\u201d, I'm like, \u201cyou right\u201d\nShe could be my angel wings, her voice sounds like an angel sings\nYa I'll be back with the trademark strings\nJust try to compliment the sounds she brings\nShe's like, \u201cWe could go far\u201d, I'm like, \u201cyou you you are\u201d. I'm like, \u201cyou you you are\u201d\nYou are, my guiding star\n\n[Hook]\nShe's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby) [x4]"}], "artist": "Taio Cruz"}
