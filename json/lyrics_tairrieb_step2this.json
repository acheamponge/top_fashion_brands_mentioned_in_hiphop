No, I don't need that\nJust a funky top with no feedback\nIt ain't about color when I step on the mic\nI can rock any crowd, weather black or white\nI know who I look like, but don't even say it\nJust go to the store, buy my record and play it\nAnd realize that I'm on the rise, guys\nAnd no fiance and no martial ties\nSurprise, yeah I thought that you would be\nI'm the girl in your dreams that your girl never could be\nSo don't underestimate or be a summoning\nThat my rap is weak or my beat ain't booming\nBecause I'm a woman, it's me your pursuing\nBut your in your towel right now, I'ma shoeing\n\n[Hook: Tairrie B]\nStep to this, the subject is dancing\nStep to this, the subject is dancing\nThe subject is dancing\nThe subject is dancing\n\n[Verse 3: Tairrie B]\nStep to this, the subject is dancing\nStep-sisters on the side enhancing\nGo on with the show and go with the clock\nYo, Tricky, just let the beat drop\nI'll grab the mic and sing another funky dope rhythm\nSome people may say I ain't damn\nBut know I'm down with Comptown\nPlatinum bound, you found the sound of the underground\nSo when the amp starts bumping, my heart starts pumping\nThe walls are thumping and the crowd is jumping\nHey DJ, give them a scratch to get hot\nCatch the beat and keep the spot\nWith a cool rthymn, deliver to the drop\nOf the beat on top, non-stop\nCut to the rthymn while I give them a taste\nOf a voice of [?] and lyrical bass\nTurn up the trouble so the level is louder\nAnd Tricky's on the tables, boys don't crowd her\nGiver her some room to complainant the blue\nOf the kick-drop, don't think their dumb\n\nCome on baby\n\n[Verse 4: Tairrie B]\nFinally, or should I say Finale\nEast coast dialing like to a record [?]\nYou know [?]\nSecond guess and [?]\nI'm dropping lyrics to the twenty-four track\nWhile Bilal creates a beat in the back of this voice\n[?] go is choice for the occasion\nIt's a Cu-Comptown Caucasian\nNot an aryan nation, no, a little devil\nBut I'm the blonde hair, blue eye level\nI'll take my rthymn in light\nSo I'm well prepared when I step to the mic\nNever scared and if I'm there, it's useless\nTry to compare but this bitch is Ruthless\nA dope MC, not on my knees\nThis ain't a pran-out, please\nI express myself with a mic in my hand\nAnd a two turn table band\nI have a million songs so the mics go play it\nDiamonds on the finger from the boys outdated\nThe lips are powder and if I doubt it\nTake a look at the plates I play, it's crowded\nI pay out front but before the show\nBackstage I stay cause I lay low\nBut when the lights go down, I come to dismiss\nTo suckers who can't step to this\n\n[Outro-Dialougue: Tairrie B]\nThe definition to step to this is as follow:\nNow you can either step to this MC in-hand or you can step to this dope jam. But either way you choose, it don't matter\n(Yo, JV is still hitting, hitting, hitting...)"}], "artist": "Tairrie B"}
