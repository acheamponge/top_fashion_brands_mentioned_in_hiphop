Nat C's clocking dough\nBe-Bop's a pimp, my old freak's a ho\nThe batter rams rolling, rocks are the thing\nLife has no meaning and money is king\nThen he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin\nHe said, \"Man, you out early, we thought you got ten\"\nOpened his safe, kicked me down with cold cash\nKnew I would get busy, he didn't waste time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 5]\nI bought a Benz with the money, the rest went on clothes\nWent to the strip, started pimping the hoes\nMy hair had grew long on my seven year stay\nAnd when I got it done, on my shoulders it lay\nHard from the joint, but fly to my heart\nI didn't want trouble, but the shit had to start\nOut with my crew, some punks got loud\nShotgun blasts echoed through the crowd\nSix punks hit, two punks died\nAll causalities was applied to their side\nHuman lives has to pass just for talking much trash\nWe didn't know who they were, no one had the time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 6]\nSwat-team leader yelled, \"Hit the floor\"\nReached in my pocket, pulled my .44\nDove across the room, peeped out the window\nTwenty cops jumped behind a Pinto\nOut the backdoor like some damn track stars\nBroke down an alley, jumped into a car\nSuckers didn't even see us, they musta been blind\nBlack wire touched red, the car was mine\nWe hadn't done nothing but some suckers got shot\nHit the first turn, goddamn road block\nBroke through the block and we did it fast\nCops wouldn't shot us on sight, they wouldn't took time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 7]\nThe rollers gave chase at a serious speed\nOne more conviction was all I need\nThis shit was for real, it was no La-Di-Da-Di\n'Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody\nAnd me and my crew, we were known to get ill\nWe carried heat for protection but not to kill\nWe bust a corner doing 60, one police car spun\nAnd all I was thinking was, murder one\nBust a move into an alley and did it right\nAnd me and my crew, we're gone into the night\nBroke to my old lady's who drew me a bath\nShe didn't even know what happened, didn't care, didn't ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 8]\nWe made love like crazy on top of the sheets\nThis girlie was my worlie, a natural freak\nShe ran her tongue over each and every part of me\nThen she rocked my Amadeus while I watched TV\nA technician with a mission, that's what she was\nIf there had been a crowd she would've got an applause\nThis girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done\nThen she backed off and teased me so I couldn't cum\nThen she cold got stupid, pushed me on the floor\nHad me begging to stop as I was screaming for more\nAfter she waxed my body, she let me crash\nShe knew her loving was def, she didn't waste time to ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 9]\nUp the next morning, feeling good as hell\nSleeping with a girlie sure beats a cell\nHit the boulevard in my A.M.G\nHo's catching whiplash, trying to glimpse the T\nRing on my mobile, yes, cellular\nGot to have a phone when I'm in my car\nWas my homeboy Red, some say he's insane\nBroke his bitch jaw for smoking 'caine\nTold me to meet him at the airport\nSaid he's jumping bail, said he just left court\nCaught the first thing smoking in a serious dash\nDidn't know where we were going, didn't care, didn't ask\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 10]\nFell asleep on the plane and so did he, woke up chilling in N.Y.C\nCalled up my posse when I got there\nHit the Latin Quarter and Union Square\nRooftop devil's nest, the rest we passed\nBack-door'd the Palladium just for class\nAbout 4 a.m. we crashed the deuce\nWe never catch static 'cause my boys got juice\nDeuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads\nWhere a shoot-out jumped off, nine people lay dead\nIt sounded like it happened with a Mac-10 blast\nBut it was 6 in the morning, we didn't wake up to ask\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ab7d21a30777a200502b262aa24e40af.600x590x1.jpg", "album": "Rhyme Pays", "year": "1986-01-01"}]}
