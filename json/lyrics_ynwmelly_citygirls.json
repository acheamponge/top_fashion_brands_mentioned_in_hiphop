Do you trust yourself?\nAnytime you walk out the door\nIt's a bag full of ones and lame nigga under your belt\nBut I won't judge\nI won't judge, don't judge yourself\nPromise I'm not here to burden you\nI'm here to help (Nah, for real)\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you're looking for someone to change your life, change your life\nI can be the one who can change your life\nIf you're looking for someone who can change your life\nBaby, I can be the one that can change your life\nAnd I know that you're young and you're filled with life\nAin't no need to be ashamed, I don't judge nor bite\nIf you're looking for someone who can change your life\nAin't no need to cry, baby, wipe your eyes\n\n[Refrain]\nShe don't want love\nShe don't love no one but herself\nOnly thing she cares about is a lace-front weave\nAnd the boutiques from Chanel\nShe don't want love\nShe don't want love from no one else\nShe don't want love\nShe don't love no one but herself\n\n[Verse 3]\nI wanna amuse you, oh, let me use you\nAll for the good, not for the bad, I won't abuse you\nWon't say I need you, just scared to lose you\nPut down your pride, see through your eyes, somebody bruised you\nKnow what you been through, I won't avenge you\nAct like you mad, act like you sad yet, but yet, pretend to\nSay you love honesty, but yet, it offends you\nJust hit my line, I got some lovin' I could lend you\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you're looking for someone to change your life, change your life\nI can be the one who can change your life\nIf you're looking for someone who can change your life\nBaby, I can be the one that can change your life\nAnd I know that you're young and you're filled with life\nAin't no need to be ashamed, I don't judge nor bite\nIf you're looking for someone who can change your life\nAin't no need to cry, baby, wipe your eyes\n\n[Refrain]\nShe don't want love\nShe don't love no one but herself\nAll she really cares about is a lace-front weave\nAnd a bag that's from Chanel\nShe don't want love\nShe don't want love from no one else\nShe don't want love\nAll she love is herself", "title": "City Girls"}]}
