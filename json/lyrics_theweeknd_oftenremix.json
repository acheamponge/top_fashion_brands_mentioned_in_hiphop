I twist the weed\nYou on your phone texting your friend to come fuck\nI wonder if it's the druggies wit hoes or the millions of bucks\nBut, ask me if I do this everyday you know\nI'm ballin', make 80k straight off the plane you know\nTrade my grill in for the Bentley or the Range you know\nI'm in the studio just tryna get some brains you know\n\n[Hook: The Weeknd]\n\n[Verse 3: Rick Ross]\nFreakier than freaky, when she climax she make pee pee\nStep back like a player, turn my cheek she try to reach me\nWhat you in this for? Another sucker for a whore\nNever I, tailored by my new young Anna Wintour\nCenterfold attraction, sexual compassion\nOften memories are faded, these are everlastin'\nLong eyelashes, palmin' her every asset\nOften imitated because this life I live is lavish\nBud like a flower, Miami's new Eiffel Tower\nLove in the dark to the beat of my heart\nShe came from the ghetto and now her closet is Neiman\nOften the results of the women joinin' my team and dreamin'\n\n[Bridge]\nOooh, the sun's risin' up\nThe night's almost up\nThe night's almost done\nBut I see your eyes\nYou wanna go again\nGirl, I'll go again\nGirl, I'll go again\n\n[Hook: The Weeknd]", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/31923107066faf19fef653e5464c53e1.500x500x1.jpg", "album": null, "title": "Often (Remix)"}]}
