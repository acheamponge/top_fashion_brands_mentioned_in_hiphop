We could roll up (Star Trak)\n(Fam!) Don't try to roll up (Star Trak)\nDon't make me pull these motherfucking fo's up\nCause it's like that!\n\n[Verse - Lil' Flip]\nUh! Well here's a little story I'd like to tell\nAbout a H-Town Pimp and I ain't got his mail\nIt started way back in 1999\nWhen I got my first dime and I started to grind\nNow we can Rock N' Roll, I got a roll of rocks\nAnd when you hear {*sirens*} there go the cops\nWhen the block get hot, homie we gon chill\nAnd bid like 22 mill, we could plan a deal\nMy light too real for me to act like you\nI'm playing wit too much paper to put slacks like you\nYou could call me Betty Crocker cause I'm baking them cakes\nAnd when I cross the interstate, I'm switching up plates\nI'm watching the Feds, they're watching my moves\nI'm paying my dues, I'm spraying my tools\nWe never play by the rules\nYou might hate to lose if you play wit us\nYou ain't heard? Me and my homies keep them K's wit us\nYou'll stop - drop, roll, we'll shoot ya in the head\nAnd when I'm chasing my bread, I'm shaking the Feds\nAnd I'm - packing my lead, y'all ain't ready for me\nThe only time you saw a Bird was on Sesame Street\nI got street birds, and I keep 'em in my pouch\nPlay wit my money and I turn into Oscar the Grouch!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge - Kelis]\nAww shit, this is part when the fight just start\nWhen the fists get to swinging and the .45th spark\nAnd then the bitches get to running and the bitch just scream and\nWe speed off in the Rolls and it's so damn clean\n\n[Verse - Fam-Lay]\nI stand on my block, the gamblest spot\nMy hands in my pocket both hammers is cocked\nWaiting for a nigga to just act up\nMy right hand big six got my big back up\nLookers lookin all jealous lookin mad as hell\nActing like little girls like tattle tales\nMad cause my right hand bad as hell\nI woulda kept shooting but I had to sell\nSee I'm a Crime Boss 365\nLookin for a nina raw, she just to ride\nPicked up my cash and slide off sweet\nNigga tried to snatch ass knocked his heart off beat\nNigga talked trash like the shit all sweet\nWon't ya all take the cash dog, not off me\nHustlers in my veins, you cannot stop it\nWalking on the block wit life in my pocket\nI'm tryin' to sco' and get this shit off quick\nYou ain't from the ghetto y'all don't know bout this\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge]", "title": "Rock N\u2019 Roll (Remix)"}]}
