Yeah\n\n[Hook]\nIt ain't safe where I'm from\nNiggas start beef never knowin the outcome\nRather be caught with it than caught without one\nLeave it alone because the life that you save might be your own\nIt ain't safe where I'm from\nNiggas start beef never knowin' the outcome\nRather be caught with it than caught without one\nLeave it alone because the life that you save might be your own\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, Oh no, let's get drunk and fuck fo' sho'\nPlease stop runnin yo' mouth let's go\nActin' like you've never seen a dick befo'\nAll these bitches in here\nOh no, let's get drunk and fuck fo' sho'\nPlease stop runnin' yo' mouth let's go\nActin' like you've never seen a dick befo'\nAll these bitches in here"}], "artist": "Xzibit"}
