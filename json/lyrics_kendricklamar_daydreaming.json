I'm a motherfuckin' problem, puto\nGive me respect, I hold it down for DJBooth.net\nAnd they tell 'em K-Dot got next\nAnd they tell 'em K-Dot got necked\nFrom your baby momma\nOn my momma, brain like a genius\nI'm travelin' to Venus\nWhere aliens got pistols 'round they V-necks\nSnub-nose, Kleenex\nI suppose I done drove artists to a place\nWhere the daily deceased sleep at\nCompetition comin' up short like a dwarf\nBut, of course, I'm a short fuse ready to blow\nGo 'head and put your gun down, we can go toe-to-toe\nMano e mano, you ain't ready, I'm deadly as plec disease\nGod-given, you trippin', I've walked the Seven Seas\nMoses, cold as they heart, cloned as art\nFoamin' at the mouth, wildebeest slaughter opponents\n'Bout business when I kicks this, ridiculous symphony\nTick-tock, boom when you infants give me some room\nCentral and Rosecrans, Compton don't raise killers\nThey raise Conans with survival tactics\nYou love drama? Well, welcome to the land of theatrics\nEven a preacher be packin' like role managers damage your goods\nCameras roll through the hood, tryin' to get that footage\nEven newscasters come to your block when you wouldn't\nThis the city at it's best, have a seat, hold your breath\nA breath of fresh air, DJBooth.net and Dot\nKendrick Lamar, K-Dot, that is, ha-ha-ha, ha, yeah"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
