I had the BRILLIANT idea of taking 26 shots\nDidn't even make it all the way! By 23, people was just passing me WATER\nIn this damn shot glasses, talkin 'bout 'Here, here, it's vodka, it's vodka!'\nMan, all I remember.. from that night\nWas you ending up having to take me home.. and on the ride\nI went from laughing, damn crying, boo-hooing\nThen... get to my girl's house.. and wanted to fight-ed..\nSome nigga that was outside.. you tellin me to shut the fuck up\nAnd then when I get to the house, I didn't really care about my girl no mo'\nAll I was askin for was the damn dog.. ehehehehe!\nWell... turned out that I peed in the bed\nThinkin I was in the bathroom... yeah, not a good look\""}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
