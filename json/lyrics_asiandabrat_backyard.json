{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Intro]\nWe was in the backyard\nNow we drive foreign cars\nIn the back end!\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I wash my face with tears\nI don't know why they try to interfere with sin\nSeat on cruise, press forward in the Benz\nGreen light! Remember when we was in the backyard!\nBack end! Like a sport I just go hard, Mac-10!\nAny nigga wanna die for it? Backyard!\nTake control like a pornstar\nRemember we was in the backyard\nThey cannot resist, I'm a star\nOther day I had my wrist in a jar\nMaking plays, you was playing in the park\nGreen light! I was just in the backyard\n\n[Verse 1]\nAnd I don't do mess\nI was dead and broke, finessing how I saw a check\nYou ain't achieving if you leave your knowledge to the rest\nI stood out in school cause I was wearing what I felt\nI let fake expose itself cause they gon' see me sweat\nI put that S up on my chest, like I am Heaven sent\nWhy you so mad cause I'm winning and I passed a rookie?\nSlept on couches now your favorite club they called to book me\nI was posted in the trenches with a given dream\nTo get some money for the team and help my family feens\nYou ain't built like me, can't fuck with me, backyard serving lovely\nAll these hand outs, didn't nobody call when I was struggling\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I wash my face with tears\nI don't know why they try to interfere with sin\nSeat on cruise, press forward in the Benz\nGreen light! Remember when we was in the backyard!\nBack end! Like a sport I just go hard, Mac-10!\nAny nigga wanna die for it? Backyard!\nTake control like a pornstar\nRemember we was in the backyard\nThey cannot resist, I'm a star\nOther day I had my wrist in a jar\nMaking plays, you was playing in the park\nGreen light! I was just in the backyard\n\n[Verse 2]\nWashing dishes in the backyard\nServing bails out the store, don't got no Nascar\nPopping bars, on my lonely I been feeling dark\nTake a Xanax, beat the problem like a charge\nSaid that I would never change\nI'm a living witness right from the streets right to the fame\nPut some weight up on my name, they saying it in vain\nI can't help, but got all of my youngins' out the rain\nOh! We was walking 'round with no rain coat\nDo you know the feeling of being a kid and alone?\nDaddy was in jail, had to learn on my own\nMama wasn't home, had to wear my own throne\nPlease stay in your place, backyard selling cake\nYou may judge me now, but god make no mistakes\nPlease stay in your place, AK to your face\nYou may hate me now, but god make no mistakes\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I wash my face with tears\nI don't know why they try to interfere with sin\nSeat on cruise, press forward in the Benz\nGreen light! Remember when we was in the backyard!\nBack end! Like a sport I just go hard, Mac-10!\nAny nigga wanna die for it? Backyard!\nTake control like a pornstar\nRemember we was in the backyard\nThey cannot resist, I'm a star\nOther day I had my wrist in a jar\nMaking plays, you was playing in the park\nGreen light!
