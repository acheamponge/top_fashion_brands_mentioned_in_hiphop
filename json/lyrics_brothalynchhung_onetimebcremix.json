Voorhees\nEven if it's bloody, more cheese\nSmokin' hella pounds of weed\nO.E. fuckin' up my gut but I'm as drunk as can be and eatin' raw meat\nReap what you sow\nI got that heat that'll make you cold\nDie at 21, nigga, fuck gettin' old\nMoney to fold, kill at shows, shootin' lead toes\nHit then split, don't trust no setup hoes, wet up clothes\nGrindin' in this Killafornia sunshine\nOne 9, killer for hire, fuck money sometimes\n\n[Chorus: Bad Azz]\nLike it's one time\nGrindin' in this California sunshine\nFrom L.A. to the Bay to Sac-town and back down\nTake a bird outta town on a Greyhound\nOr serve on the curb in ya hood, nigga, stay down\nLike it's one time\nGrindin' in this California sunshine\nFrom L.A. to the Bay to Sac-town and back down\nTake a bird outta town on a Greyhound\nOr serve on the curb in ya hood, nigga, stay down\n\n[Verse 2: Bad Azz]\nMan, these wicked streets will drive a nigga insane\nThe weak'll cock back and put pistols to they brain\nThe weed, alcohol, nicotine, and cocaine's\nThe plot to break the strong down\nTo eat, you gotta cheat or break a law now\nFuck 'em, buck 'em all down\nY'all down? We can tear this muthafucka up again\nShootin', lootin', snatchin' people out they truck again\nFuck 'em then, muthafuckas wanna lock me up again\nHave me stuck, stressin', writin' letters home from the pen\nAnd man, fuck that, I'd rather be stuck back on my block\nSellin' rocks wit' a Glock, probably runnin' from the cops\nFuck one time, grindin' in the California sunshine\nWhere the motto's get rich, and bitch, fuck money sometimes\nRunnin' numbers, rob the runners, get your bundles\nKeep it comin', get it, get it, hollerin' \"Money money money\"\n(Yeah, I'm down, nigga) Hollerin' \"Money money money\"\n\n[Chorus: Bad Azz]\nLike it's one time\nGrindin' in this California sunshine\nFrom L.A. to the Bay to Sac-town and back down\nTake a bird outta town on a Greyhound\nOr serve on the curb in ya hood, nigga, stay down\nLike it's one time\nGrindin' in this California sunshine\nFrom L.A. to the Bay to Sac-town and back down\nTake a bird outta town on a Greyhound\nOr serve on the curb in ya hood, nigga, stay down\n\n[Verse 3: Bad Azz]\nI live the life of a mobster\nCatch us talkin' money, eatin' lobster\nAnd life swallow niggas whole just like a monster\nYour bones is the proof of death\nInvestigators later said he died a spooky death\nAnd you don't even wanna hear how they said he died\nJust as well, California's home for homicides\nWe dodge death all day tryna stay paid\nAnd if our rivals don't come, then the cops don't raid\nSo if a nigga ain't high, you know we drunk as fuck\nAnd if a nigga ain't rich, he's tryna touch a buck\nWe holla \"Get it\", hollerin' \"Money money money\"\n(Yeah, I'm down, nigga) Hollerin' \"Money money money\"\n\n[Chorus: Bad Azz]\nLike it's one time\nGrindin' in this California sunshine\nFrom L.A. to the Bay to Sac-town and back down\nTake a bird outta town on a Greyhound\nOr serve on the curb in ya hood, nigga, stay down\nLike it's one time\nGrindin' in this California sunshine\nFrom L.A. to the Bay to Sac-town and back down\nTake a bird outta town on a Greyhound\nOr serve on the curb in ya hood, nigga, stay down", "year": "2014-10-07", "album": "The Suicide Tour (10 Years Later)"}], "artist": "Brotha Lynch Hung"}
