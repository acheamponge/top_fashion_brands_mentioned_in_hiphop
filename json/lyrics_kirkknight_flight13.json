But I, uh...\n\n[Verse 1]\nYo, I get a little buzz now my inbox filled up\nHoney bums, hood bums asking for beats, SHEESH\nBut back to the women, God given talent\nGot a young nigga winning, relationship status change on Facebook\nAnd now they all mad, and now they all sad\nThey calling me Kirk, she better be bad\nBut like I said, temptation's a bitch and I like her\nAnd Im'a love her when it comes under the covers\nSo my cutty buddy, I love the pillow talk but I ain't tryna miss cutty\nAnd all these words ain't implying that you're slutty\nAaaaah shit, she wanna chill again\nAnd she can bring a friend, and she can bring a friend, and she can bring a friend\nAnd now I'm fucking with it\nBill Clinton, no relations, don't fall in love with it\nAnd Im'a make sure that your heart don't get bigger\nAnd stop fronting and bust it for a young nigga\nCome bust it for a young nigga\n\n[Bridge]\nThe lusting went to touching and the touching went to [x6, slowing tempo each time]\nForeplay [x10]\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe touching went to something\nI'm cyber and I'm lusting\nShe started fronting\nI was like, \"Don't play, cause I'm busting\"\nShe said, \"Not right now, and let's play around\"\nThis means we not, Im'a just give her the finger and I'm out but\nFirst, I gotta ask, \"What the fuck is this about?\"\nShe said, \"I been watching you and you been watching me\nBut since we both here, Im'a see where this leads\"\nBefore you start, I like to play with my muh'fucking food before I muh'fucking eat it, muh'fucking eat it\nNow your friends left cause you taking too long\nThen you all alone\nBut you gonna take all night, girl\nIt feels so wrong but it's right for a girl like you\nMascara hides your massacre\nVampire inspires your love tonight\nShe love the night, I swear to God she never get tired\n\n[Outro]\nThe lusting went to touching and the touching went to foreplay\nAnd it is quite amazing, but sex is what I'm aiming at\nInspired by a little bit of this, yeah, and a little bit of that\nJust take a hint, and do the math [x2]\nTake a hint\nA little bit of this, a little bit of that"}]}
