Catholics don't know the half of it\nImmaculate magic tricks. experimenting with alliteration and assonance\nBut speaking too many cold words chapped my lips\nThere's an asterisk up on my left arm\nBut my foot notes are out of tune from my music always getting stepped on\nShould've kept calm when I was granted the chance\nBut that's my song getting me amped, so god dammit let's dance\nDammit, bring this stuff to fisticuffs if that's the only thing that'll help\nSomeone like you feel good about yourself and the things your dealt\nI'll win the belt but if you need to keep your pants on...\nHere another battle for you to talk about in your damn song\nHere another battle for you to talk about, wow, look at that...\nAnother...battle...rap\n\nYou won't have to duck, i'll just talk over your head\nKnowing your dead career has one year left\nTil everyone else knows what I said\nThey're laughing at you but you don't know it yet\nI'd say it to your face but I don't want to waste the moment. Let...\nEveryone first understand the open threats that poets get\nWho's wet behind the ears? who broke a sweat?\nJiggy man - sip your moet\nThuggy dun- hold your tek\nNetcee - go on the net and keystyle '\nBout how we gets no respect", "album": "Sick of Waiting Tables"}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
