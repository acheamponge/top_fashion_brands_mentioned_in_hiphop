Fuck, man.  In the hood, man (Fort Knox!).  It\u2019s from the heart, man.  It\u2019s from the motherfucking heart, man (Abandoned Nation!).  Don\u2019t ask me some shit about it on record (Volume One!).  Nah\u2019m saying?  Fuck niggas, man.  We live in the hood, motherfucker.  If I can get on record and talk about all the shit I\u2019ve been through, man.  Niggas, look in my fucking eyes, man.  I\u2019m 25 years old, man.  Look at me, man.  Fuck is going on, man?\n\n[Bridge 1 (Overlapped with Intro): Sample from Fantastic Four - \u201cMy Love Won\u2019t Stop at Nothing\u201d]\nIf you could tell me\nWhy did you take your love\nWhen mine was here to stay?\n\n[Verse 1: Saigon]\nI\u2019ve been through war, been through fear\nMy whole life, in and out of prison for years\nBut who cares?  Do you care?\nWell then hug me and tell me that you swear\nI doubt Jesus even love me anymore (Nah)\nI don\u2019t he has since I was a little boy\nDog, I had to walk before I crawled (Why?) \u2018cause\nWe had mice, roaches, and rats patrolling our floor\nBy fourteen, I\u2019m holding a four.  Most niggas\nMy age was getting whoopings \u2018cause they stole from the store\nBut me?  I\u2019m on the ave, being cop-car-spotted\nPistol on my waist with a pocket of narcotics\nNobody could tell me nothing.  Far as sex\nI was already fucking when my dick was the size of my bellybutton\nLord knows I got some praying to do\nTry and sit and listen to what I am saying to you (Go \u2018head)\n\n[Hook: Jovan Dais and (Saigon)]\nYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve been through\nIn my life (No) in the past few\nYears\n(Nigga, you have no fucking idea) I\u2019ve\nHad my share of ups and downs\nMade some mistakes (Yup, and I\u2019ve...)\nAnd I shed some\nTears (You hear?)\n(You have no fucking idea)\n\n[Bridge 2: Jovan Dais] (x2)\nOh\nLord, please\nWatch over me.  Days\nStrange, can\u2019t change\nMy destiny\n\n[Bridge 3: Sample from Fantastic Four - \u201cMy Love Won\u2019t Stop at Nothing\u201d]\nYou\u2019re my love\nHe took yours away\n\n[Outro: DJ Whoo Kid and Saigon]\nDJ Whoo Kid: Whoo Kid, Just Blaze.  Y\u2019all can\u2019t stop it.  Saigon.   Whoo!\nSaigon: Y\u2019all little dusty-ass niggas in the hood.  Nigga, get your fucking weight up, man.
