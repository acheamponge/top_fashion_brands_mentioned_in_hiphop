I'm underage but far from underpaid\nI'm fresh to death, stay fly until I'm sleep off in a grave\nYou got them hoes you fuck with groupies that I used to know\nSay you gettin' money man, now money's what I choose to blow\nFinna pop some bottles, scream I'm through\nCame to shut the club down\nSo make some room, I'm...\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow we in the club, hear the DJ scream my name\nHe shout out Heavy Hustle cause the DJ know my gang\nI'm standin' on the couch in V.I.P. I swing my chain\nThe DJ play my song, I throw my cheese and go insane\nAnd I got what they need, they come and shake it for a boss\nThese hoes just out here choosin' homie take it as a lost\nSweat comin' out my pores this Patron got me heated\nSecurity know what it is with me, I'm gettin' weeded\nThe hoes say I'm conceited. Niggas say I'm a fool\nMy chain is fuckin' freezey, this shit is kinda cool\nAnd I'm the kind of dude to walk behind your boo, tell her fuck ya man, I'm the man what you tryna' do\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/100d0985ce3b8ee4e2364dd7c94351b4.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "Star Power", "title": "Bankroll"}]}
