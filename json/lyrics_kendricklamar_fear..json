Somebody that's holdin' my checks\nJust to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?\nI read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered\nHow did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?\nThe type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'\nDrill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'\nI practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck\nAt 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged\nHow they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city\nWhat they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me\nWhat they see from me would trickle down generations in time\nWhat they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines\n\n[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride\n'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness\nFear, whatever it is, both is distinctive\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nSearchin' for resolutions until somebody get back\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nWonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap\nDamn\n\n[Bridge 2: B\u0113kon]\nGod damn you, God damn me\nGod damn us, God damn we\nGod damn us all\n\n[Outro: Carl Duckworth]\nVerse 2 says, \"You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.\"\nSo until we come back to these commandments\nUntil you come back to these commandments\nWe gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse\nBecause He said He's gonna punish us\nThe so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians\nAre the true children of Israel\nWe are the Israelites, according to the Bible\nThe children of Israel\nHe's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience\nBecause we chose to follow other gods\nThat man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee\nSo, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chastise you\nBecause He loves you, so that's why we get chastised\nThat's why we're in the position that we're in\nUntil we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments\nAnd do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us\nWe gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live\nHere, in today, in the United States of America\nI love you, family, and I pray for you\nGod bless you\nShalom"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
