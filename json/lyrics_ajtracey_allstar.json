Come and let go\nFor your set gold, you can get your neck blown\nNormal Henney but my chicks looking XO\nI get inner city money, metro\n\n[Verse 2: Mark Ellison]\nOutweighs them, top dog after\nOne high status in this bitch, motherfucker (what you saying, fam?)\nBlaze them, will leave you wet in the pan\nI ain't talking turkeys, you fucker\nStraight remake him, replace your arms with your legs\nSee, I'm fucked in the brain, you suckers\nWith snub nose AKs for you fuckers\nGuarantee you get left around with no cover star\n\n[Verse 3: Jay Amo]\nMy dargs fully on violence, we dodge from the trident\nAnd I ain't talking channel when I say my niggas sky shit\nAnd if there's no strap, then we fully on knifing\nMan are flatlining\nCuh man are talking like they pull strings, no violin\nCome around here, get robbed for your ice, king\nBig Jay keeps the snub on silence\nAnd if it's beef, I holla at Loonz like \"you riding?\"\n\n[Verse 4: Shino B]\nNow, I ain't the type of nigga just to hype for no reason\nBut niggas got it twisted like they're really on this greaze ting\nI ain't a roadman in the slightest and I mean\nThey fuck with man, they getting wrapped up, bodybag season\nThose who know me, I'm a joni, know the meaning\nGot a grieving faggot breaching, need the team and leave 'em screaming\nI'm a pedigree, these canine niggas chiefing\nBut their bars probably dark so I get 'em like treatment\n\n[Verse 5: Muddles]\nYo, I make money, money don't make me\nI keep it pushing like a buggy with a baby\nShe say I'm fly and I'm wavey\nShe put a word out to her friends and now her friends wanna taste me\nWhenever it goes wrong, I'll be thinking of another plan\nFakes, jakes and snakes, it's like they're all in love with man\nTell me what I've gotta do and tell me what's the problem, fam\nCause if I call a couple man, someone's gonna vanish, fam\n\n[Verse 6: Devinkz]\nThis pussy didn't want it, snapped him on his back\nScared his lights out, gave him a heart attack\nHe didn't want it, so I laid him flat\nHe got lippy, blew a chair straight through his back\nI laid him on the bay so you can all watch\nPut him in a casket, ha, no box\nI'm foul, but the referees don't get involved\nTie him up one time, problem solved", "year": "2012-09-13", "album": "Didn\u2019t Make the Cut", "image": "https://images.genius.com/51db766c29f3e2e57ab4cd96d426a048.360x360x1.png"}], "artist": "AJ Tracey"}
