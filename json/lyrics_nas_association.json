who you associate with\nLook around at your five closest friends\nAnd that's who you are\nIf you don't want to be that person\nYou know what you gotta do\n\n[Chorus: Nas]\nAssociation breeds similarity\nThat's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas\n'til six niggas carry me\nPoverty's a mind state\nTime waits for no man, but no man\nWants to die a poor man with no plan\n\nAssociation breeds similarity\nThat's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas\n'til six niggas carry me\nPoverty's a mind state\nTime waits for no man, but no man\nWants to die a poor man with no plan\n\n[Verse 1: Nas]\nYou can try to kill me, but I come back\nHate me, that's a small thing\nDemons let the sword swing and sever off my offspring\nBitches try to see me down, hugging the floor\nBullets pulling me, playing tug of war\nWith my body, gravity got me\nPolice want me arrested, just to see me naked\nSnakes want my necklace, fake niggas make me set-trip\nThugs shooting reckless (every night, niggas)\nWonder, how will I exit (from this life, niggas?)\nThink you a killer, get cement shoes in the river\nYou should watch them people with you\nLet them street rules hit you\nIf you hang around snitches, you get judged for that\n'Cause you condone it, you know there ain't no love for that\nThere's slugs for that\nOh, you didn't know your man was talking?\nThat's why you stand with him, 'til you both land in the coffin\nWhen you first heard he was snitching, then you should have thought\nEvery time this nigga got caught selling, they let him walk\nEarly on a nigga was taught, stay away from them niggas\nSo a nigga like Nas got nothing to say to them niggas\nI fuck with, only the trusted thug clique\nWho really done shit, run up in your bitch, bust the gun quick\n\n[Chorus: Nas & Stic.man]\nAssociation breeds similarity\nThat's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas\n'til six niggas carry me\nPoverty's a mind state\nTime waits for no man, but no man\nWants to die a poor man with no plan\n\nAssociation breeds similarity\nThat's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas\n'til six niggas carry me\nPoverty's a mind state\nTime waits for no man, but no man\nWants to die a poor man with no plan\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nSome bitches lie a lot, they could be fly or not\nActresses cry a lot, their girlfriends spy a lot\nThey can shake your hand, girl\nThen they take your man, girl\nThe whole hood knowing\nWe got something good going\nNone of these hoes is after me\n'Til they saw us happy and that you bagged me\nNow they wishing that they had me\nSo watch who you hang with, and who you cling with\nYou know these bitches ain't shit, they hoping to bank chips\n(With a baller) after she done gave him some head\n(He never called her) he gang it and he left her for dead\nBirds of a feather fly together\nBut chickens don't fly, they eat their own shit and die\nAnd you affiliated, now you look weak\n'Cause your peeps is freaks\nCredit card stealing hoes, well known in the streets\nAnd they brought your down in the dirt\nYou was a pretty, young, smart thing\nGoing to work, I bet it hurt\n'Cause you had a clean rep\nBut the girls you seen with make these niggas say\n\"I bet that bitch suck a mean dick\", word\n\n[Chorus: Nas & Stic.man]\nAssociation breeds similarity\nThat's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas\n'til six niggas carry me\nPoverty's a mind state\nTime waits for no woman, but no woman\nWants to die a poor woman with no man\n\nAssociation breeds similarity\nThat's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas\n'til six niggas carry me\nPoverty's a mind state\nTime waits for no woman, but no woman\nWants to die a poor woman with no man\n\n[Verse 3: Stic.man]\nA warrior walk alone, there's one spot on this throne\nFake friends be off and on, but a man stand up on his own\nI'm raised by a different code, cut from a different cloth\nNever been a follower, my momma told me be a boss\nWatch who you hang around, don't let nobody bring you down\nFriends come and go like seasons, leaves turn to brown\nAnd some only come around when everything is green\nBe careful not to let a snake infiltrate your team\nFor every Jesus there's a Judas, every Caesar there's a Brutus\nIf somebody tell you jump off a bridge -- are you gon' do it?\nThere's two types of influence: either healthy or deadly\nKeep your circle small, away from all the hate and the envy\nDon't come nowhere near me with it, I'm bullshit intolerant\nMy politics boss up, for you black empowerment\nI stay in my element, Braveheart intelligent\nOnly associate with those for my betterment\nI'm out for dead presidents to represent mines\nOnly click with my kind, my best friend is my grind\nEverybody got big dreams, but few follow through\nAnd it's deep: the company you keep become apart of you\nDon't just be sitting around smoking weed, letting time fly\nIf your homies don't inspire you to rise, tell 'em bye\nYou're better off dolo than rolling with a weak ass crew\nI'm like Scarface: Who I trust? -- Me, that's who\n\n[Chorus: Nas & Stic.man]\nAssociation breeds similarity\nThat's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas\n'til six niggas carry me\nPoverty's a mind state\nTime waits for no woman, but no woman\nWants to die a poor woman with no man\n\nAssociation breeds similarity\nThat's why I'ma stay with real rich niggas\n'til six niggas carry me\nPoverty's a mind state\nTime waits for no woman, but no woman\nWants to die a poor woman with no man"}], "artist": "Nas"}
