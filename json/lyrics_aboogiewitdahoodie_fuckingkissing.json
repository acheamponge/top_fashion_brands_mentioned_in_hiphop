(Everyone's different)\nBut look, I'm somethin' different\nMelody gifted, you are my witness\nLouboutin Christians, givin' me blisters\nI'm sinnin', but I miss you, and girl, do you miss me?\nWhat's the difference between fuckin' and kissin'?\nIf you ain't with it, then we can just kick it (Kick it)\nFuck all the kissin'\nWe should just get into switchin' positions (Positions)\nFuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin'\nGirl, do you miss me? You trippin', 'cause I miss you\n\n[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]\nFuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin' (Oh no)\nFuck me and kiss me, like you miss me, I know you miss it (Oh no)\nFuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin' (Oh no)\nFuck me and kiss me, like you miss me 'cause I know you miss it (Oh no)\n\n[Verse 2: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]\nNext time I fuck you, I don't want you to say, \"I love you\"\nAnd next time you suck it, don't touch it\nDo somethin' that's gon' make me cum quick\nI wanna see how you bust it\nBut if you start buggin'\nI'ma fall back and start actin' like I never met you\nMy money bigger, if I take your bitch\nMan, I don't mean to be disrespectful, I'm just that nigga\n\n[Verse 3: Chris Brown]\nWould I be trippin'\nIf I DM your friends and fuck all your bitches?\nWould it be ignant?\nYou say I'm trippin' but they the ones with it\nI thought it was love\n'Til you went out tellin' our business\nLyin' when you know you did it\nCryin' but don't see no tears\nI guess we really all guilty\nFake friends all circle 'round me\nYou wanna show everybody 'round me how I bleed\nPlead, the truth, will set you free\n\n[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]\nFuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin'\nFuck me and kiss me, like you miss me, I know you miss it\nFuckin' and kissin', fuckin' and kissin', girl, fuckin' and kissin'\nFuck me and kiss me, like you miss me 'cause I know you miss it"}], "artist": "A Boogie Wit da Hoodie"}
