This the only young nigga I know selling drugs without a car. This nigga pulling up on y'all niggas in the motherfucking Uber, man. Skinny ass jeans with the rips in 'em, that's my nigga, my young nigga off up in this bitch. Your bitch bored, so he kick-flipped her ass like Lupe. Hoe ass nigga, get your motherfucking money right. I got young niggas stunting on y'all bitch-ass niggas, hoe-ass niggas. Clouds full of codeine 'round this bitch. Get some double-cups, hoe-ass nigga. Young Cam Provider off in this bitch, nigga"}], "artist": "Tay-K"}
