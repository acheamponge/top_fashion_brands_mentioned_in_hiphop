(come on girl)\nCame home off the road, shawty\nEven when i wasn't supposed to\nSure i gave her a lil' dick\nBut i gave all my love to you. (come on)\nNo it ain't about the money\n\nButs it funny when you get mad, shawty\nCause you never keep it true\n\nDont be offended\nOf anything\nI might say\n\nOf course you were there for me\nWhen my mouth was hurt\nAnd a nigga couldn't talk\nI remember when you were prgnant\nI was there when\nYou couldn't even walk\n\nNo i dont give a f**k about them other hoes\nAs long as we can live life like gold\nYeah im looking at your pockets\nTey lookin kinda swoll\nDo that make you a hoe? (NO)\n\nDont be offended\nOf anything\nI might say\n\nOHH, you had drama with my mamma\nBut i stayed with you ate it all up\nLike a runna\nAnd when you find out shit\nYou got mad and got the hell on\nAnd skeeted on like a road runna\nI hope you chill out\nCause you got my baby\nAnd to me shes the number one stunna\nYou gotta cool that shit down, baby\nEven if you dont wanna\nYou gotta keep it true\n\nDont be offended\nOf the things\nI might say"}], "artist": "Lil Scrappy"}
