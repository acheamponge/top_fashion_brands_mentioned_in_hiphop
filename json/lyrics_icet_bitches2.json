He could use mine too\nBut bust this!\nOut on the street\nPeople say he was riffin'\nCallin' me a sucker\nTalkin' bout how foul I'm livin'\nSomeone heard him\nPoppin' that shit last week\nFrontin' for some pussy\nFrom some big-butt freak\nSayin' I'm his worker\nI was on his dick!\nTalkin' that craazy old weak assed shit\nAnd after all of that\nShe still walked away\nHow ya gonna diss your boy\nTo get some play?\nAnd when I stepped to him about it\nHe said, \"Who snitched?\"\n\n[Bridge 1]\nYo, how did he go out?\nHe went out like a bitch!\nSo ladies\nWe ain't just talkin' bout you\nCause some of you niggas\nIs bitches too!\n\n[Chorus]\n\"You ain't nothing but a... \"Bitch!...\" \"Nigga...\"\n\"Some of you niggas are bitches too\"\n\nI knew this brother named Mitch\nStone player\nHe meet a girl, in five minutes he'd lay her\nTrucked crazy jewels\nHands smothered in ice\nBeen to prison not once, but twice\nKept a stupid thick posse\nMade of thugs and\nCrooks and hoods\nAnd vet hustlers\nWho were up to no good\nBut they all stood behind him\nAnd watched his back\nThat's the only way\nTo roll on the track\nBut yo\nMitch got rushed by feds last week\nThey snatchbared the trunk\nOf his white Cornice\nTook a look inside\nAnd what did they see?\nTwo keys, and a gallon of PCP!\nOh shit! The thought crashed\nMitch's subliminal\nThree strikes, that's called\nHabitual criminal\nSo insted of goin' under\nHe snitched on his whole posse\nMaxed at the crib\nAnd sipped Martini and Rossi\nSold out his whole crew\nThat rat named Mitch\n\n[Bridge 1]\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI knew this guy\nThat was never that fly\nCouldn't act cool\nEven when he tried\nWhen we played rough\nHe always cried\nWhen he told stories, he always lied\nA Black brother\nWho was missin' the cool part\nHe had the color\nBut was missin' the true heart\nWhen we would fight\nHe would always go down quick\nSo he took karate\nAnd he still got his ass kicked\nBut now he's married\nAnd he kicks his wife's ass\nSays it comes from problems\nThat he had in the past\nDoesn't like Blacks\nClaims he's upper class\nJoined the police, got himself a badge\nNow he rolls the streets\nAnd he's out to jack\nDoggin' young brothers\nCause they usually don't fight back\nGot a White partner\nAnd he asked for that\nAnd every night\nAnother head they crack\nSo now he's big man\nBut he really ain't shit!\n\n[Bridge 2]\nYo, how did he go out?\nHe went out like a bitch!\nSo ladies\nWe ain't just talkin' bout you\nCause a lot of these pigs\nAre bitches too!\n\n[Chorus]\n\nOut one night with my crew\nAnd some new kid\nI didn't know homeboy, but Evil E did\nSo I thought he was cool\nWe rode in his ride\nRag top tray on Daytons\nLifted side to side\nWe hit the party deep\nNiggas was hawkin' me\nYou could feel the vibe\nOf thick artillery\nParliament was on, some O.G. shit\nI put my back to the wall\nAnd felt my pistol grip\nAl of a sudden\nNiggas started trippin'\nFlippin', the record started skippin'\nWildin', fools started locn up\nGats cracked\nThe room started smokin' up\nMe and \"E\" hit the floor\nAnd then the back door\nMy boys let off an automatic encore\nBut when we made it out to the ride\nIt was gone, we had to shoot it out\nSide by side\nPunk left us there to die in a ditch!\n\n[Bridge 3]\nYo, how did he go out?\nHe went out like a bitch!\nSo ladies\nWe ain't just talkin' bout you\nCause you scary-ass niggas\nIs bitches too!\n\n[Chorus]\n\nSo if you're wonderin' why we lookin' at you funny, it's cause\n(some of you niggas are bitches 2)\nYou always tell a brother you're gonna loan him money but you don't cause\n(some of you niggas are bitches 2)\nYo, Aladdin, you know why they be frontin'?
