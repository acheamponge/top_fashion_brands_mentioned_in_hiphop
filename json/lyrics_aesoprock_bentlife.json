{"songs": [{"lyrics": "{Aesop Rock}\nYo\nI take 10 steps with a bent left vision\nStudy the disorders we've absorbed inside the village\nI understand the plagues and why they shake hands with my grimace\nThen remain up in my face like top to bottom train car fill-ins\nLet's question the ascension of a broken social icon and bury its domino affect\nI'mma blow this hex over the mission\nJust to administer the end-all sucker punch toward its pitiful condition\n\n{C-Rayz Walz}\nWith no alibi love is used as a guide by the civilized\nSome see it as the body heat you feel when you close your eyes\nThat's so much of a lie, you can leave your hair dyed and scorch your roots\nAs the truth hits your ears begin to cry\n\"Why Is It Like This!\" Why the fuck do I care?\nI don't have the answers, or at least the ones you want to hear\nCity lights look like bright groups of fire flies\nMany see the truth (the proof) only when the liar dies\nTires screech to a halt, the ground cries\nSpit sparks speak to the streets\nThe skid marks are replies\nRead discussions of what we rode through entrenched in the vocals\nThe hopeless stay hopeful (the toxic fumes choke you)\nAs I walk out my door, step into the pollution\n(I breathe in the problems) exhale solutions\nPhysically the situation's hard to stop\nI had a wicked jump shot and sold crack rock on back blocks\nCasualties in this apocalypse (street chronicle)\nAbnormal abdominals (push-ups phenomenal)\nRelaxin drinking my 6-pack maxing\nFaxing my thoughts on the satellite, via Donahue (push it)\nTable talk, salt and pepper conversation\nIntegrated sectors, metropolis and mecca\nIt's a conspiracy (you know), I can't lie dukes\nSometimes I feel the rats got a better deal than I do\n\n{Aesop Rock}(Chorus)\nIt goes thieves, bandits, low lives, scum\nPunks that buckle under the rumble of my drum\nSteadily searching for something new under the sun\nBut its stagnant, active element first of madness\n\nThieves, bandits, low lives, scum\nPunks that buckle under the rumble of my drum\nSteadily searching for something new under the sun\nBut its hurtin, act of development first diversion\n\n{C-Rayz Walz}\nA new universe in ancient, so I stay patient\nIn a gravel pit, travelin thoughts unraveling, pacing\nEmbracing light of America, and found a shade of darkness (underground)\nThe traincar used to be my apartment\nSick of people rushin in the doors before I get out\nConductors closing the doors before I get in, I shout\n\"The blizzard's coming, the blizzard's coming!\" ?\nDon't get worried now (We've been in a cold world!)\nWe just getting flurries now?\n\n{Aesop Rock}\nYeah, its like sloooowww dooowwwn\nYou're movin much too fast to bust through the finale fashioned glass\nIts delicate demeanor and I teach you how to hang\nBut we like 1970 something 20 kliks outside Da Nang (Dear Obedience)\nI apologize for the faulty academics\nBut they placed us in a miserable stasis\nI let bygones be bygones\nBut tryin to see eye to eye with the faceless\nJust ain't working the way the manual paints it\nSee I soak in a blue note factory\nWhile most cats hassle bandits lamping (?) solo\nAnd when the last red brick topples over the earth\nTo intercept your crooked little mess\nI can be found in a social coma directly to your left\nEngaged in a conversation, a marvel with my breath\nRegarding how to document the shady baby steps\nI bounce checks like a modern man\nSleep with one eye open while the other two drift\nTogether specimens from the promised land\nThis for the thinkers\nThis for the urchins allergic to they own stingers\nThis for the absurd verdict linkers\nThis for that cat at my shows that's always got prophetic opinions\nBut can't remember where his drink is\nI'm wallowing, shrugging I'm plugging your corporation\nCause we alley cats addicted to the sickly warped sensation\nAnswer this: when all is said and done\nAre you a memorable trooper or just a lab rat on the run\nChoose one\n\n{Chorus}", "title": "Bent Life", "album": "Labor Days", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6a16cbbd76c264fec96a9675981e9556.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2001-09-18"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
