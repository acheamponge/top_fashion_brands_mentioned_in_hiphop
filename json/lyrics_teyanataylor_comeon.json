(Could this be love?)\nWanna give you the recipe of destiny, it starts with me and you\nAnd maybe I'll be the melody so sweet, it's never out of tune\nNow I wanna be the one you need, like yeah a breather attached to you\nSo baby, come on, come on, come on!\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat you do to me? Living in a fantasy\nThere's no one in the whole wide world\nBaby, it's just you and me\nSo baby, don't you break my heart\nAnd don't you wanna play your card?\nSo baby baby, come on, come on, come on!\nOh, baby give it to me (baby, give it to me)\nAnd if you like what you see (and if you like what you see)\nOh, baby give it to me (baby, give it to me)\nAnd if you like what you see (and if you like what you see)\nOh, baby give it to me (baby, give it to me)\nAnd if you like what you see (and if you like what you see)\nThen baby baby, come on, come on, come on!\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nLike sweet morning dew, it took one look at you\nAnd it was plain to see, you are my destiny\n\n[Verse 2]\nShawty, I'm here for you any time you need me\nFor real boys, me in your world, believe me\nHave to make a man feel better than a woman\nA queen with a crown that be down for whatever\nThere's a few things that's forever\nYour lady, we can make war, make babies\nBack when I was nothing, you made a shawty feel like she was something\nThat's why I'm with you to this day, bro no frontin'\nEven when the skies were grey, you would rub me on my back and say \"baby, it'll be okay\"\nNow that's real to a woman like me, baby\nNever ever give you lovin' away, I keep it tight\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat you do to me? Living in a fantasy\nThere's no one in the whole wide world\nBaby, it's just you and me\nSo baby, don't you break my heart\nAnd don't you wanna play your card?\nSo baby baby, come on, come on, come on!\nOh, baby give it to me (baby, give it to me)\nAnd if you like what you see (and if you like what you see)\nOh, baby give it to me (baby, give it to me)\nAnd if you like what you see (and if you like what you see)\nOh, baby give it to me (baby, give it to me)\nAnd if you like what you see (and if you like what you see)\nThen baby baby, come on, come on, come on!\n\n[Outro]\nCome on, come on\nCome on, come on\nCome on, come on\nCome on, come on\nCome on, come on\nCome on, come on\nCome on, come on\nCome on, come on"}], "artist": "Teyana Taylor"}
