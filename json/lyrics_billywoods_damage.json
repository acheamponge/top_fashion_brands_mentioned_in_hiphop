Dutton\nNo more motherfucker jobless shucking\nPushing that Mutually Assured Destruction button\nLights out, world.  Guinness stout hurled\nIntergalactus Mount, prepare for rolling blackouts\nBlack Backwoodz rolling on back routes\nNo doubt.  Put the mic down, get your\nGats out, lick a round for this champion sound\nGutter mouth, speaker face, subwoofer\nUnder the ribcage, enter the valley with\nThe light brigade, clutching rusty razorblades\nGillette phrase giving out close shaves\nLike UNLV games.  I take great\nPains not to sound like you lames, not to\nSound like you lames\n\n[Verse 2: billy woods]\nI see dead people, photo albums of yearbook\nPages, rusting, gilded cages oxymo-\n-ronic like slave wages.  Pressure build \u2018til it\nCracks gauges, swallow pride, mouthfuls\nOf razors and catch the vapors, burning bare\nFoot in Jamaica to dodging lasers in the land of\nSkyscrapers, old-school payphones and pagers\nDrunk, bucking out blazers, hit\nBystanders and keep stepping like drum majors\nThat\u2019s gangster, huh?  woods collapse\nStages.  [?] pulling favors, that\u2019s\nGangster, huh?  Or so you think\nThe world is roller rink\u2014skate \u2018til that\nGate clink.  Some of these lady cops could get a wink\nBut they better not blink.  Somewhere from\nDissing NSYNC to gangster ink, too much\nAliz\u00e9 in that drink.  That\u2019s some TV shit\n\u2018Cause, in the hood, same niggas that empty clips\nIn wheelchairs, saying if they had one wish...\nBut the damage is done\n\n[Verse 3: billy woods]\nCareful like operation, shock therapy patient\nGrow room, be patient, spit\nVacation, inhale medication, a blue\nBlood relation, paradox when he bled\nThoroughbred, thorough dreads, higher heights\nKnown for getting nights rolling like dice, holding\nTop flight, duty-free THC ener-\n-gy.  RPG, who the enemy?\nSober off the Hennessey, sweating bullets\nIn Tennessee, guerilla my pedigree\nAll I need is ten of me\u2014that\u2019s self-\n-therapy like Hamas on my couch\nWhy are guided missiles headed for the house?  I got\nA claymore mount, shrapnel grill shine like\nPlayers down south.  Don\u2019t let me find\nYour whereabout, put your body\u2019s parts there-\n-abouts.  Now you\u2019re quiet as a church mouse\nSunday service baptized with verses\nMore water, water than a go-go.  You nervous\nThis style cursive, coercive like\nPolice chokehold, accidentally on purpose\nAccidentally on purpose"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
