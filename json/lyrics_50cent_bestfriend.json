It's my tape man, listen to my tape\n(I've waited\nI've waited\nTime went by\nBut all I could do is cry\nSilly, silly)\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time\n(I want you 'round me all the time)\nGirl, I'll be your best friend\nIf you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)\nPlease say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)\nEither he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)\nPlease say he's just a friend\nIf I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time\n(I want you 'round me all the time)\nGirl, I'll be your best friend\nIf you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)\nPlease say he's just a friend (Uh huh)\nNow girl let's not pretend (Come on)\nEither he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)\nPlease say he's just a friend\nIf I was your best friend\n\n[Verse 1]\nFirst we get to talkin, then we get to touchin\nIf we get past the phone games we'll be fuckin\nI kiss like the french do, I put my tongue in your ear\nDo it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair\nFor me a different scenery just mean a different position\nIn the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen\nIn the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club\nI'm no fool I know money can't buy me love\nBut I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know\nInstead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those\nSee I see somethin special when I look in your eyes\nWith your legs way back I see this pussy is mine\nIf you ain't sure when I'm talkin I don't tell you no lies\nBut there's things that you say that have me wonderin why\nWhen I don't say what I'm thinkin it don't mean that I'm shy\nGot on that shit you picked out for me that's why I'm so fly\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time\n(I want you 'round me all the time)\nGirl, I'll be your best friend\nIf you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)\nPlease say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)\nEither he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)\nPlease say he's just a friend\nIf I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time\n(I want you 'round me all the time)\nGirl, I'll be your best friend\nIf you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)\nPlease say he's just a friend (Uh huh)\nNow girl let's not pretend (Come on)\nEither he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)\nPlease say he's just a friend\nIf I was your best friend\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhile you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back\nWhen you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that\nI sit and think of things to say that may make you smile\nOr give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style\nOr slang I use when we build may change how you talk\nAnd if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk\nThat's the swagger you come with when you come from New York\nI'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought\nSeparate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best\nIf there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice\nI'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right\nI ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets\n'Fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit\nI get closer to you, I mean closer than close\nI get into you, after I take off my clothes\nGirl I been into you, mentally long before\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time\n(I want you 'round me all the time)\nGirl, I'll be your best friend\nIf you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)\nPlease say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)\nEither he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)\nPlease say he's just a friend\nIf I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time\n(I want you 'round me all the time)\nGirl, I'll be your best friend\nIf you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)\nPlease say he's just a friend (Uh huh)\nNow girl let's not pretend (Come on)\nEither he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!)\nPlease say he's just a friend\nIf I was your best friend", "year": "2005-11-08"}]}
