When the whole world is a hustle\n\nTo escape this mere analogy means that I must face the fear in me\nDo something with this greed in me in order to address this need in me\nOh but I must confess the pride I keep, protect it as if it's my friend\nUntil the bitter end when the whole of the world is a hustle\n\nEverybody\u2019s got it going on (yeah right, yeah right)\nEverybody\u2019s so damn strong (yeah right, yeah right)\nWhen the whole of the world is a hustle, a hustle (x5)\nI must exercise my faith cuz faith is a muscle\nWhen the whole world is a hustle"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
