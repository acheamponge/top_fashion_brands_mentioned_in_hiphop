I'm not\nWhy? Cuz I got me a flu shot\nThat's right, I got me a motherfuckin' flu shot\n\nVerse 2:\nPulled up to the lot in my big Escalade\nPulled out my coupons cuz I get shots prepaid\nSit on the line for about an hour\nThen felt a little hungry and I picked up some chowder\nOh hell no!\nThe chowder was Manhattan, not New England\nSo I pulled out my musket til the bullets started sprinklin'\n\nChorus:\nYeah\nI'mma get a flu shot\nHey, you sneezin' but guess what? I'm not\nWhy? Cuz I got me a flu shot\nThat's right, I got me a motherfuckin' flu shot\n\nVerse 3:\nAfter I start shootin', everyone ran away\nSo I was the only one gettin' a flu shot that day\nI stepped up to the counter and I said\n\"Hi, how are you? I came to get shot up, you know the one for the flu?\"\n\nChorus:\nYeah\nYo I'mma get a flu shot\nHey you all bloated and nasty and I'm not\nWhy? Cuz I got me a flu shot\nThat's right, I got me a motherfuckin' flu shot\n\nVerse 4:\nShe sat me down before she shot me up\nI threw my hair back because I love that stuff\nSaid \"We done now, you can put yo pants back on\"\nAnd I said \"Thank you miss I-\"\n\nI don't really know why I had to take my my pants off\nActually, actually looking back, I was completely naked", "year": null}]}
