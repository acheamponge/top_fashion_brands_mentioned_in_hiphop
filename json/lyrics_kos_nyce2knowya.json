[x3]\n\nVerse 1:\nI live inside your head just like the day before tomorrow\nAnd spending most our lives recalling things we already know\nI tried so hard to steal the sky and call it heaven bound\nAt times I feel like I'm alone like the new kid in town\nShe said I need your love, that's what she said\nShe said she had to break the mirrors that exist in her head\nI often wonder if I could keep you compromising things\nBut then I feel the heat and wind beneath these angel wings\n\nHook:\nNice to know ya\nCan't believe it's almost over now and you just wanna let me go\nNice to know ya\nAnd when I look up at your picture I see somebody I ain't seen before\nNice to know ya\nCause every time you talk about it how come I'm always the last to know\nNice to know ya\nEven though you don't deserve me cause you would rather close the door\nNice to know ya\n\nVerse 2:\nI'd rather run then work this out\nYou're like the sun cause you burned me out\nAin't no time to waste\nI already had my taste I gotta find another way\nYou and I go in forever out of place because I'm leaving you today\n\nFlow Switch:\nOoh never change always be the same\nDriving slow on purpose up in my fast lane\nThen again I think you reason with the Kheaven\nIf perception is reality perceive that I be leaving\nI know the reason\nUyou need something to believe in\nGod she's the type to kick a sleeping dog\nRaw when I eat the beef like a freak I'mma [?] turning the other cheek\n\nBridge:\nI don't wanna be the one to tell you it's over\nI'm wise enough to see the sun I'm finally sober\nI'm moving on you can't prove me wrong girl\nThere's nothing left to say cause I'm gone\n\nOutro:\nNice to know ya\nCan't believe it's almost over now when you just wanna let me go\nNice to know ya\nAnd when I look up at your picture I see someone I ain't seen before\nNice to know ya\nCause every time we talk about it how come I'm always the last to know\nNice to know ya\nYou know you don't even deserve because you would rather close the door\nNice to know ya"}], "artist": "\u200bk-os"}
