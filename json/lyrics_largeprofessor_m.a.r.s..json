I think I'm blessed cause I'm eye-seeing them\nRoc Mars said it's cause I got bars and I'm nicer than them\nThey all right, I ain't as biased as him\nNah, I'm lying; them niggas drier than psoriasis skin\nLyrically, I'm a messiah to them\nSing em a rockabye\nIt's gonna be Mega Action happening when you Roc with Sai\nThat's M.A.R.S., motherfucker, and I'm not gone lie\nHip-Hop is something we came to occupy\nTell em why"}], "artist": "Large Professor"}
