Ain't tryna be out in the cold like that\nBoujee still, when this city grow like that?\nCute in hills, then a trackie for the road like that\nAll details, yeah, I can do both like that\nI push my own set of wheels on the road like that\nShit, I'm actually a G, my friends, you know like that\nTrust me, I'ma free up, I'm been moving and weaving\nNow the gate in my ways, through the system, I seen museum\nEveryone's got a purpose, everybody's a being\nBeing the only alien, y'all around me, I'm seeing\nMore than you can imagine, who'd of thought this would happen?\nTeachers looked at me funny when I said I'd make it from rapping\nStill got love for Miss Rosen, still got love for Miss Wilton\nI don't fuck with Miss Chambers, she didn't do me no favours\nCalling out all the agents, can't see beyond they nose\nI kill shit then I kill shit, when shit's killed, I'm ghost\nDon't wanna talk depressed, get them cameras out my face\nI'm anti-social as fuck, lord, just need a smaller space, space\n\n[Verse 2: Axel Leon]\nYo, I wanted them to say something for having but I'm pissed off\nThat I ain't take it serious then, and it took me this long\nI pissed on everything I ain't doing number two long\nWhat is you on? I'm heroine, I traveled here in a brick form\nThey turned on me, all ego, man\nI had to start again from scratch like Preemo hands\nDid more, Halle Berry in a Coogi, I'm a big storm\nI rip y'all, you wack, off rip but it rip off\nI almost quit sniff, quarter drip then I gripped on\nWe lit mom, I'm at the awards without a hit song\nThink I said \"kill it on BET\"\nLike don't be human, be an alien, be E.T\nEBT? That's a TBT\nTurn BET to Boriqua y TTV, juice\nLeon, rappers don't got enough fire to show me\nYoung Jugo, y'all could call me five fire emojis\nPut rappers in a pot, come and check if it's boiling\nYou put him feet first and push him 'til his neck in and boil it\nThirst 'til everything in your saving and checking is voided\nCouldn't stone but he collect unemployment\nHeard him almost threw up, sewer, doo doo like he grew up next to the toilet\nI don't even put in effort, I spoil it\nFor everybody trying Leon on line they can't effin' avoid it\nI ain't stop, already effin' destroyed it\nWe run rap from the jump, I'm KRS One to Capital Pun\nThat's when I promised Pun I would bring rap back to the Bronx\nWe catch him, let him go, put him back in the trunk\nAfter the pump blast to the lung, they task in the trunk, mhm\nWrist said I'm big with it like a half a key\nMy neck chilly like I've never been to Applebee's\nI'm the best, no offense to anyone that back with me\nBruh, they set you up before they put you after me, Jugo\n\n[Verse 3: Mysonne]\nWelcome to reality\nI'm a fake rapper's rivalry, the leader of the cavalry\nYoung Huey P. with Big Meech mentality\nThe rap Kapernick with 2Pac's anatomy\nI got 'em mad at me\n'Cause I freed kids from the trap and put morals over salary\nBut they would rather me lie the way they lied to me\nHave them in these streets dying, becoming casualties\nBut nah, I'm a whole different breed\nEverybody following, I was sent to lead\nI'm a soldier, when I bleed, I just lick the wound\nNo, you not a G, you got it misconstrued\nYou all on IG, lying to get views\nYou got these little kids dying, trying to listen to you\nOr they sitting in prison instead of sitting in school\nBecause you told them play the game, didn't give them the rules\nWon't you tell them to fix their plan just to lose\nTo all my young kings: don't ever listen to fools\nNah, I'm not hatin', just a little confused\nHow show 'em all the diamonds, never give 'em no jewels?\nAnd if you're tired of the buffoonery\nFollow me, I'll show you how to shine without jewelry\nShow you how to grind and bought back to community\nBring black on black crime, back to black unity\nIf you a G, I know you see you and me\nGangster, but wow, ain't nothin' nigga can do with me\nOne man army, imagine if it was two of me\nI swear next year Oprah gon' try to cougar me, huh\n'Cause I did it on my own\nI'm putting work, now I'm sitting on his throne\nCrown me the same way that you do any king\nI rather nail for something than just stand for anything\n\n[Verse 4: Tee Grizzley]\nAt the cypher, I ain't write this, let it come from head\nOne rule amongst my gang, let's keep one in the head\nThey hatin' but they ain't gonna touch one of my dreads\nAfter I gun at your head, boy I'm 'gon come for your mans\nI'm from Detroit, where we run up through bandz\nCut up them grams and go dumb with them scams\nYou owe me some money, better run my bread\nWhen mark jump out with that pump, you can't run it's sprayin'\nThey throw their beef over the gram, they feds\nCan't even speak about my beef, they dead\nOnly time rappers start to act like my friend\nIs when they in my city looking for protection, they scared\nI can't eat without my dawgs, they fed\nI can't really tell if they opps or they fans\nI think that prison did somethin' to my head\nI was locked up with somethin' this long strapped to my leg\nI heard the trenches got a hero, it's about time\nHundred on my neck, I came a long way from Compton\nFifty on my wrist, I came a long way from child time\nIf I stacked up hundreds, it would stand about 5'9\"\nBallin' on these boys like I'm Bron-Bron\nDunked that green side and that white side, Hassan\nEverywhere I go I'm strapped down like I rock climb\nI would keep goin' but I ain't got time, hah\n\n[Verse 5: 6LACK]\nAround the time when Lil Wayne was on every hook\nI was on my worm-tip, I was in every book\nAnd T-Pain was killin' every remix he could smell\nThem my homie did some shit and had to sit in the cell\nSo I focused on my music, chose my sentences well\nNow my sentences sell, I don't censor them well\nConnected to a higher power like I sit in a cell\nTower, this ain't rappin' while I'm splitting a cell\nOkay, all my favourite rappers are washed up\nAnd write the same song ten times, leave me star-struck\nMy president on crack, my exes is black like my name is\nI ain't even 'posed to be famous\nI heard 'em saying \"Who they sayin', who be they?\"\nBut they ain't never put the work in\nInternet surfing, Instagram lurking, been waitin' on this moment since Tigger was in the basement\n106 was poppin', Free looked amazing\nDamn, that boy got a flow of a hunnid guns\nShe say \"Baby, you a savage,\" I say \"21, 21\"\nWhen I finish this verse, download my album\nTake a chance on a rapper, you don't want no problems\nWatched enough cyphers to know I need a gun bar\nSomethin' 'bout an AR and how that thing is dumb tall\nI'ma take it, I'ma swing it like a pendulum, dog\nAnd your toup\u00e9e ain't safe, so you better run, dog\nIt's a DMX flow, it's a we up next flow\nThey can't really handle bars, it's a BMX flow\nI'm skippin' through this thing like I'm Snoop, what it do?\nAtlanta got a star, boy, I'm the proof\nHip-hopped over the beat, hopscotched over the street\nTop-notch, mispronounce my name and get pop-rocked\nI come from the east, we hustle for a ten piece and split it with the game\nIt's FREE 6LACK and I'll be here until you know the name",
