say you ain't gettin' gangked no more\nBut I know who owns Death Row.. really doe\nYo I got a little piece of paper from someone\nAnd not one line on it reads Andre Young\nYou try to diss my record deal, but I'm still quick\nI'm on a mission, and I'm going for the fuckin' gift\nSo next time your in the place\nI'm hollering 1-8-7 with my Glock in your fuckin' face\nCause real niggas don't go out that quick\nSo it's cool that you bit my shit- bitch\nCause I'm a baller by far and plus a G\nAnd I like my chronic twist with some VSOP\nSee broke niggas can't buy it cause it costs ends\nShut the
