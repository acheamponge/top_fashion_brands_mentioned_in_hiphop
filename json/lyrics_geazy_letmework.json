I understand the task at hand\n\n[Chorus]\nLet me work\nWhat do you know about work?\nLet me work\nI'm talkin' about getting up five days a week, brushing ya teeth, washing your ass, going into your office and working some old guy rich paid hours\nLet me roll up my sleeves and go to work\nThat's a motherfucking job\n\n[Verse 2: G-Eazy]\nIt's still that muthafuckin' time again\nBlacking out, don\u2019t give a fuck about a thing\nFuck the world that\u2019s just the state of mind I\u2019m in\nThat\u2019s the place you find me in\nLook, ain\u2019t nobody live as him\nMillion dollar smile that I just went and put some diamonds in (yeah)\nThese rappers sneak diss when I came up, they prolly mad I\u2019m on\nBut then they transformed and changed up like a Decepticon\nBunch of bootleg Geralds copying what I went platinum on\nBut the real, it's me myself and I, you all be dead and gone\nDisrespect me, don\u2019t come to the bay, your pass is gone\nMy Obi-Wan is E-4-0, he givin' game, I pass it on\nStudy him 'cause he the one that lasted long\nThis beat I go assassin on\nI just took some acid, hit the booth, and started rapping strong\nTreat the studio like a decathlon\nNever slowing down, I'm tryna put my whole damn family on\nWork every night, I go 'til after dawn\nTo be the biggest thing in the world, I\u2019m not the one to pass up on\n\n[Chorus]\nLet me work\nLook, you could be a fuckin' bank teller, you could be a waitress\nLet me work\nOr wash cars, sell clothes at a fucking boutique. Alright listen, you're makin' somebody else rich. You're punching that clock. You clock in, you clock out, you making that money\nLet me roll up my sleeves and go to work\nHow does that work?\n\n[Verse 3: G-Eazy]\nA fucking hater's always looking, tryna search for targets\nIf you don\u2019t know me, don\u2019t speak on me, stick to your departments\nWhile they debate if I\u2019m an urban artist\nOr if I\u2019m merging markets\nAll I really know, I\u2019m just working hardest\nAnd 'til the day I die, I\u2019m hustlin\u2019, doing work regardless\nI\u2019m in my twenties, if I go I leave a perfect carcass\nA polarizing artist\nBut you could love or hate me\nBut try and say I don\u2019t pay my dues, fuck off, how dumb could they be\nNobody help to make me\nI did it by my lonely\nWho else did songs with everybody Britney Spears to Mozzy?\nYou New York Times aristocrats you should just relax\nYou miss the facts\nBitch, I\u2019m from the Bay, was born to bridge the gaps\nAnd I\u2019m a legend in my city, they say \"His shit slaps\"\nSaid I'ma go and sell a million, I'ma get these plaques\nAnd bring 'em back to inspire every kid who raps\nI\u2019m Michael Phelps, get out my lane, I\u2019m swimming different laps\n\n[Outro]\nYeah\nLet me work\nLet me roll up my sleeves and go to work"}]}
