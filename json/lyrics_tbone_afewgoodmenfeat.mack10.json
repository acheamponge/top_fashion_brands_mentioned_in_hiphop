Mack 10)", "lyrics": "Strap up the boots, I'm ready to shoot\nLoad the ammo, Bone Soprano wit Glocks and green camo\nI play rappers like they grand pianos, a general\nCall shots like I'm Joe Bonanno, what, The West is back\nSep this dude ain't black, he Latino dogg and rock Gringos\nBlack, Indians, Palestinians, and Phillipinos, and cash money like Vegas casinos\nI'm armed and ready, palms is sweaty, kinda like em\nSep I got a sharp machete, and I'm quick to toss wack rappers of a levy\nWords is heavy, kinda like a 6-4 Chevy, uh\nHip-Hop will never be the same, it's time for change\nI'm bout to rearrange the game, ready to fight back\nSo when they say who's that, tell em it's just the king of the conscious rap\n\nChorus\nSee all we need is just a few good men\nCuz ain't to many left like Bone and Mack 10\nWe know nobody's perfect, so repent for ya sins\nSo ya better get it straight, cuz he's coming again\n(Whisper) He's watching\n\nMack 10 -\nI got the hood on smash homey\nAnd though I'm ballin' full throttle\nI'll never run outta gas homey\nI'm so fly as the days go by I'm better\nSo I dump re-up and keep getting more cheddar\nYou know what it do\nMack 10 a savage\nGot hustle in my veins so I fiend for the cabbage\nFresh baller to the end\nTell a friend and a neighbor\nAin't that I got so much flavor\nIt's that I got so much favor\nI'm like Pac I get's down, against all odds\nAnd you don't wanna go to war with a child of God\nSo if you see me in a six four\nTuck ya pistol\nPlus it's on if ya miss\nSo be careful what ya wish for\nA rhyme sayer wit respect like the mayor\nPlus your arms is to short to box wit God playa\nSee I'm all for Jesus but I'm nothing like Mase\nI'm to ghetto and gutter\nBut I'm covered in his grace, yea!"}], "artist": "T-Bone"}
