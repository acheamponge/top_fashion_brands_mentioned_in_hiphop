I don't\nLast year, I felt suicidal\nThis year, I might do somethin' different like talkin' to God more\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm lookin' for change\nI'm lookin' for (Yeah)\nI'm searchin' for change\nI'm lookin' for\nI just want, I just want change\nI'm lookin' for (Yeah)\nI'm searchin' for change\nI'm lookin' for, yeah (Ayy, ayy)\nI just want, I just want change\nYeah, I'm lookin' for (Lookin' for)\nI'm searchin' for change\nI'm lookin' for (Yeah)\nI just want, I just want change\nI'm lookin' for (Ayy)\nI'm searchin' for change (Ayy)\nI'm lookin' for, yeah\nI just want, I just want change"}], "artist": "NF"}
