I need a hun\nYou better get up, get out, and get some\nYou lookin' 'round like it ain't nunin', shit\nTryna stunt, yo we tryna run shit\nMinim wadge my nigga, you talkin' dumb shit\nI need the crib, need the truck, I'm feedin' fo' kids\n\n[Verse:]\nYou've seen hell before? my niggas already live it\nIf there's a hell below, then we already in it\nTell ya white friends though come and pay us a visit\nOur neighborhoods don't look like they're don't be scared\nWhen you see teddy bears and like 4s everywhere\nYou see streets watching everywhere you be\nYou see cops hop out on high school dropout\nHear 'em shout out \"freeze! Get on the ground!\"\nBut, but we made it out\nNow we stay where the money's at, you  jinx'd that\n[?] slayin' that lay on they backs\nAnd do whatever we sayin', we stayin' below\n\n[Hook:](2x)"}], "artist": "Black Milk"}
