It's a level playing field\nMy game's against yours, hustling wars\nRoll the dice, risk your motherfucking life\nBank rolls and low hoes, anything goes\nRidin' rolls in a week, clap a nigga who speaks\nI'm suceedin', in tryin' to keep from bleedin' in the lane\nCrystal Meth, F.C.C., and crack, cocaine\nGot a nigga tryin' to figure out the best route\nI got cops in my rear view, too, but I'll shoot\nEvery bitch I meet is fucking up to something\nTake a nigga to the crib lay him down and start dumping\nGat pumping, they'll kill your ass for a G\nHate the game, motherfucker, don't hate me\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Ice-T]\nYo, my name will sell better than rap like the Acropolis\nSuckers might as well step back, there ain't no stoppin' this\nWhack magazines who tried and tried to toppen this\nI still got more Lexus and gators on my shopping list\nMake a fist, take your best shot, bet you drop it kid\nHit more licks than you, and never caught a bid\nMake the whole world go crazy, they said about the pig\nBald-headed hoes step back; bitch, go and cop a wig\nWhen I do a show, best believe it drop\nEvery night I got my straps, best believe they cocked\nSome bitch talks crazy, then that bitch gets socked\nIf a man steps up, then he too gets dropped\nFuck the cops, I'm still folding fat knots\nCatch me on the weekend, floating my yacht\nSay, \"Ice, kick some game,\" and I'll teach you a lot\nKnock your bitch no matter how hard your block\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Outro: Ice-T]\nI don't know why a player wanna hate T\nI didn't choose the game, the game chose me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/64f26659fd999b48a36adf8773cb8eb0.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "The Seventh Deadly Sin", "year": null}]}
