Diddy\nDammit we P-driddy?? Now I got G with me\nAlong with the third leg that I be rammin in these bitties\nI keep the revolver you hope my gun'll jam\nBut with the scope its gonna blam\nThe infra put freckles on your face like Opie Cunningham\nThats why I'm watched by the Feds and scoped by Uncle Sam\nDope and hunn-ed (hundred) grams rope and hunn-ed grams\nAt the same time an artist get to open Summer Jam\nHope you understand or use better sense\nThese niggas dont want no beef they want lawsuit settlements Nigga!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm in a waggy when I'm passin by ya\nWith a baby girl who suck harder than Maggie on a pacifier\nWhat I'm smokin'll have you aggie as your last supplier\nWhen you can smell it through the baggie you know that's some fire\nGettin stressed by these hotties is regular\nI got a magazine to press to your body like editors\nTest me somebody I'm beggin ya\nI got the gatling gun like Jesse The Body in Predator\nI'm a hustler I dont sling no rocks to the fiends now\nGot dudes who sit on corners like a boxer between rounds\nAny other dude who dish rocks want beef\nCause I chop dimes bigger than Chris Rock front teeth\nI'm the nigga tearin the walls up in your miss in exchange for a small cup\nOf the Cris\nAnd while you at probation fillin a small cup full of piss\nI'm in a coupe with a roof that ball up like a fist (Catch up!)", "title": "Forgive Me Father"}]}
