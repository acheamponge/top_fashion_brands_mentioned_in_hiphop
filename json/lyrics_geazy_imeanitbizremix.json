I doubt it\nCause I'm fucking your girlfriend, and there's nothing you can do about it\n\n[Hook: Remo]\nIf I ever said I'm never scared\nJust know I mean it\nIf I ever said I fucked your bitch\nJust know I mean it\nAnd if I ever said I'm gettin' money\nJust know I mean it\nAnd oh Lord oh Lord knows\nHe knows I mean it\nYeah, you know I mean it\nYou know I mean it\nJust know I mean it\nJust know I mean it\nOh yeah oh yeah oh yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Biz]\nOverdose on my confidence\nHead is swole from these compliments\nNever needed a hand out, y'all can keep your conidments\nYour girl thinks that i'm dominant\nThe price of your incompetence\nShe got stockholm syndrome, but at least she's still an optimist\n\nBeen tryna get money cause nothing is free\nYou been spreading rumours, but talk is cheap\nI'm a big dude, need a big bank, and a bitch who is a freak\nWho goes down for me\n\nBut fuck it, they say you are what you eat\nThat makes me pussy then pussy is sweet\nRunning this game yet they try to compete\nAnd they get anxious when they hear me on beat\n\nIf the beat is dirty Better know i clean it\nIf the clothes are fresh better know i pree it\nIf you're talking Bizness Better know i be it\nIf you're talking about this song, better know i mean it"}]}
