Now let that feeling ring through your guts\n\nI thought of offing myself, I thought of killing these niggas\nWanted to take a fucking brick and push they teeth through they liver\nWanted to smash the fucking world and burn its leftover parts\nWanted to rip it out and just fucking step on my heart\n\nThen I grew up and I wasn't within the reach of these men\nBut that didn't keep me out the motherfucking reach of my sin\nAnd psychologically I was just as fucked as they come\nI was confused, I had to prove I wasn't fucked from the jump\nI was afraid of myself, I had no love for myself\nI tried to kill, I tried to hide, I tried to run from myself\nThere was a point in my life where I didn't like who I was\nSo I'd create the other people I would try to become\nSexuality came into play and with as scarred as I was\nI was extremely scared of men so I started liking girls\nI started starving myself, fucked up my bodily health\nI didn't wanna be attractive to nobody else\nI didn't want the appeal, wanted to stunt my own growth\nBut there's a fucking reason behind every scar that I show\nI never got to be a kid so that's as far as I grow\nMy mental state is out of date, and that's as far as I know\n\nMy biggest problem was fear, and what being fearful could do\nIt made me run, it made me hide it made me scared of the truth\nI'm not deranged anymore, I'm not the same anymore\nI mean I'm sane but I'm insane but not the same as before\nI had to deal with my shit, I had to look at my truth\nTo understand that to grow you've got to look at your root\nI had to cut off the dead, I had to make myself proud\nAnd now I'm just standing living breathing proof look at me now\nI made it through everything, I made you look like a clown\nI'm fucking great, can't fucking hate, you nigga look at me now\n\nNow I'm just saying this to tell you there's a way from the ground\nThe makings of a legend are often hidden in trials\nJust be strong and just move on and just accept what you can\nBecause it makes your story better when you read at the end\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, there's a story behind every single scar that I show\nI made it out, this a me nobody's gotten before\nI had to open my wounds, I had to bleed til I stopped it\nThanks for joining me here as I cleaned out my closet\nI said I opened my wounds, I had to bleed til I stopped it\nThanks for joining me here as I cleaned out my closet", "year": "2012-10-25"}]}
