into ten of me\nIf there\u2019s ten of me, tell me how many heavenly similes can we blend?\nLike women and men would fall with no friends\nLike a rose would fall with no stem\nLike most folks follow trends\nLike Os follow LMNs\nThat\u2019s how well I know life flows with the elements\nAs sunrise kills an evening\nAs stars die and a night sky is grieving\nAs man sees what he has when it\u2019s leaving\nYou gone is as asthma to breathing\nThat\u2019s how much I need you in my life\nI\u2019m never gonna ever leave you in my lifetime\nCause every time I hear line that shows me I\u2019m not alone it\u2019s saving me\nCause I know that that\u2019s a lifeline\nLike minds\u2014this is our home and they won\u2019t ruin it easily\nCause the wolf is gonna blow until he\u2019s blue in the cheek\nAnd me and you and the crew can go take a snooze in the street\nAnd the bulldozer can come chew on our feet\nWe never let em through\nWe\u2019ll build a levy\nLimit the river\u2019s level\nSteady the flood and begin with a pebble\nLend me one syllable\nCome if you\u2019re ready to shovel\nRun if you\u2019re shaking\nBut I know that today is not my Waterloo\n\n[Chorus]\nYou\u2019ve made a place where I\u2019m welcome\nAnd although I give voice to it seldom\nKnow I love you\nNobody\u2019s above you\nAnd if you love someone then you tell them\n\n[Verse 2]\nEvery day the planet\u2019s losing IQ points\nBut people still bumping Ice Cube joints\nSo I\u2019ve got hope\nAnd every day I\u2019m seeking my true voice and looking up at a bright new choice\nCause everybody\u2019s got a hustle and everyone\u2019s trying to push it\nIt\u2019s tricky to find the kush hiking up a mountain of bullshit\nAnd there\u2019s another mountain of bullshit next to it littered with glitter, money\nAnd strippers they\u2019re selling as good shit\nIt\u2019s nothing new up at the core though\nEverything same as it\u2019s always been only more so\nOf course so same token, while there\u2019s life there is truth\nWhile there\u2019s truth it demands to be spoken\nAnd someone\u2019s gonna speak it\nIt\u2019s really not a secret\nYou just need to search it\nYou just need to seek it\nAnd though we like to worship a genius in a coffin\nWe often forget that there\u2019s prophets among us walking\nAnd I know because I hear em when I am in the clouds\nAnd I got my music up and jamming it loud\nAnd dammit whatever I am or could ever become I\u2019m positive that I will\nAlways be a fan in the crowd\nSo gimme gimme gimme\nDylan and Biggy\nHit me with Jimi, Emily Dickinson, Eminem, Niki Giovanni, Lennon, Kendrick, Gambino, Rafa, Chinaka, Dahlak and Missy,Saul and Beau and Paul and Kweli, Chali 2na and Chance and Seneca\n\n[Hook]\n(Go in poet!)\n86 I was thrown in the mix, saying\n(Go in poet!)\n86 anyone who would stand in the path of a kid saying\n(Go in poet!)\n86 bitches, 86 cups full of lean\n(Go in poet!)\n86 bars, infinity ways to say what I mean\n\n[Chorus]\nYou\u2019ve made a place where I\u2019m welcome\nAnd although I give voice to it seldom\nKnow I love you\nNobody\u2019s above you\nAnd if you love someone then you tell them\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo if you\u2019re blocking the future I wanna to walk toward\nSuit yourself we\u2019re gonna lock swords\nBut it\u2019s a wash if you\u2019re saying \u201cWatsky I could rock withcha if you didn\u2019t talk\nLike some nails on a chalkboard\nI can tell\u2014that you\u2019re really on your dope writer tip\nBut you\u2019ll trip if you don\u2019t try to fit\nMaybe you can make it if you ghostwrite a hit\nAnd sell it to somebody who can ghostride a whip\u201d\nShieeet\u2014I say no sirree\nI can smell the weak shit through the potpourri\nSo I\u2019m just gonna do what I do\nYou take a minute or two and Google \u201cTim and Magoo\u201d\nI love the life that I picked even if it ain't plush\nI\u2019m too glad to complain much\nI\u2019m in the lab in a drab world\nWhile these fuckers dab and do dabs and I dab on my pad with my paintbrush\nThis is for the kids whipping up some home-cooked\nSpitting 86 bars, fuckin no hook\nLying in the grass\nPassion in their chest\nAnd a ballpoint pressed in their notebook\nListen to me, this is for the word\nLooking so fine I\u2019m rubbing coconut oil up in the crack of that spine\nThis is for the times I\u2019m reminded my mind isn\u2019t mine alone\nThis is for the poems and the lines\n(And the letters in em)\n\n[Hook]\n(Go in poet!)\n86 I was thrown in the mix, saying\n(Go in poet!)\n86 anyone who would stand in the path of a kid saying\n(Go in poet!)\n86 bitches, 86 cups full of lean\n(Go in poet!)\n86 bars, infinity ways to say what I mean\n\n[Chorus]\nYou\u2019ve made a place where I\u2019m welcome\nAnd although I give voice to it seldom\nKnow I love you\nNobody\u2019s above you\nAnd if you love someone then you tell them", "image":
