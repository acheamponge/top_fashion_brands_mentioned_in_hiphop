Huh... (hip hop, hip hop, hip hop)\nTurn my mic up a little bit (hip hop)\nHit some of this Cali guido (hip hop)\nListen to some motherfucking... (hip hop)\nEverybody got a little story they gotta tell\nNiggas ain't heard my shit...hahaha\nThe life of Bizarre...what!\n\n[Verse 1: Bizarre]\nHip hop, that's the way of life (Word?)\nIf you think you're nice, then go grab the mic (Grab it!)\nLet me tell you my story, cause everybody got one\nGrab a pen and pad and start to jot some\nAlways told myself that I would never be losing\nMan, I ain't had no hood, my mother was always moving (Damn!)\nFrom Detroit to Texas, Texas to Detroit (C'mon!)\nGoddamn, Mama, what's the point? (the fuck?)\nSo I would go in my room and pack my little bags (Aughh!)\nJump in the truck with my step-dad\nWhen I was ten years old, I started to feel the hunger\nGot a little older, man, the force got stronger (Yeah!)\nAnd me and my rap partner wasn't seeing eye to eye\nSo he picked up and started a group with some other guys (Haha)\nThis is hip hop, man, I won't stop\nYo Big Boi (What up?) Gimme a beatbox\n*beatbox*\n\n[Hook]\nHip hop, hip hop\nHip hop\nHip hop\nHip hop\n\n[Verse 2: Bizarre]\nFrom the Hip Hop Shop to Maurice Malone (Uh-huh)\nTen years later, I'm still in the zone (Word?)\n7 Mile and Foyer where a star was born (Yeah!)\nUnited we stand, divided we swore (D12!)\nAnd hell yeah, I lived in my car (Yeah!)\nBitch, I was homeless, I would have slept in a jar (Hahahaha)\nAnd Dirty Management, I wish all the best\nBut me and my niggas, we had to do what's best (That's right)\nIt was a mess, all them taxes and accounts (What?)\nChecks started to bounce, niggas couldn't buy an ounce (Hell yeah)\nAnd now that we platinum, they diss our name (What?)\nLike we won't go to the car and get them thangs\nAnd beef, sometimes you don't have a choice\nFrom the fight with Whitey Ford to the beef with Royce (What!)\nTo the Ja Rules, Benzinos, and niggas in the club\nTo the e-dubs and niggas you ain't heard of\nAnd man, I don't know how to use a gun (Naw)\nBut I'll learn quick if the fucking beef come!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nMan, I thought this was supposed to be hip hop, hip hop\nI'd rather be fishing in flip flops, flip flops\nOr cross over to country like Kid Rock, did, I\nCan't see no country singers beefing over some guitar\nRiff that Willie Nelson lifted from Bob Seger\nWhen I was younger I was so eager\nTo have a gun I would do the same\nCouldn't wait to get to the shooting range\nMe and my man Goofy Gary just trying to let loose some steam\nMotherfuckers laughing cause I couldn't aim\nSo I'd pull the fucking target closer and just shoot the thang\nI used to have this theory: keep three bullets in the gun\nIt was a mandatory year up here in Michigan\nFor each bullet if you got no CCW license\nI tried to apply for one, they said it'd take 5-6 months\nWhat the fuck am I supposed to do mean time when rivals come?\nHide that sumbitch in the glovebox or inside the trunk\nNow, back to what my three-bullet theory was\nI'm triple platinum, I ain't trying to catch no murder one\nFigured I'd shoot to wound, probably miss with at least one\nBut them other two gon' fuck his shoulder and his kneecap up\nThen I'mma say it's self defense,\" how come I had the gun?\"\n\"Was because I was at the range, on my way back from\"\nThis dude approached me on some bullshit\nI'd get a year for each bullet at the most\nAs opposed to having a full clip in that\nThat was my idiotic logic, it was basically for safety\nBut it gave me power, and it made me crazy\nAnd psychotic, I just got retarded once I got it\nThank God it was empty the night that I got caught with it\nWhat the fuck, man I thought that it was supposed to be\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Bizarre"}
