Glorify me, over-think?\nSay they know me, say I\u2019m great? Say I\u2019m phoney, I was fake?\nSay the things about me that they never told me to my face?\nI was loved I was hated, just a nigga with a dream\nI\u2019m a liar, I was honest, I was all of these things\nWhen I\u2019m gone let em talk, they discussing who I am\nWhen they bury me just know I wasn't nothing but a man\nWasn\u2019t nothin\u2019 but a man\n\n[Hook]\nThis for them niggas climbin\u2019 heaven's stairwell\nYeah, hey farewell\nYeh, hey farewell\nThis for niggas climbin\u2019 heaven's stairwell\nI pray you farewell\nI bid you farewell\nYeah, hey, farewell\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf I should die Lord this here is my will\nReincarnate a nigga send me right back to the Ville\nLet me relive my younger days just once again\nReenact my memories from every friend to every sin\nKeeping demons buried in my closet\nBut yet I put in work like a deposit on my bank account\nMy eyes lit while I think about my childhood now I'm blanking out\nThose were truly my best days\nThe only thing I had to stress was how the hell to get laid\nGradually turn into me stressin\u2019 how the hell to get paid\nBeen making songs so long, now how the hell they get played\nOk, I\u2019m blowing up quickly, I guess the flow is sickly\nBut yet I can\u2019t forget my past and hope it won\u2019t forget me\nGot good grades but A's can\u2019t stop strays so pray for me\nPour liquor for my niggas but hey, don\u2019t wait for me\nCause I\u2019m trying to cheat death, she out to bury my ass\nYou know the cliche \u201clife's a bitch\u201d well I\u2019m gon marry that ass\nAnd sign a pre-nup, think back to when we tore the skating rink up\nRapping and we scrapping, we got older hit the teen club\nGave mean mugs to niggas but we winked to all the girls\nThen we went back to the crib thinking we had saw the world\nNo sir, came a long way from having momma chauffer\nIt's hard to think these hoes at some point were so pure\nBut now we play the game, when it's over send me back\nI swear I\u2019m not gon change a thing\nI swear I\u2019m not gon change a thing\n\n[Hook]\nThis for niggas climbin\u2019 heaven's stairwell\nYeah, hey farewell\nYeh, hey farewell\nThis for niggas climbin\u2019 heaven's stairwell\nI pray you farewell\nI bid you farewell\nYeah, hey, farewell\nYeah, yeah"}], "artist": "J.
