They wanna be famous, aight?~\nBecause I said \"let's become a star, I'm on the verge of insanity\nI become a prey on my own, stirring the spoon\nBattle royal, a profession where I must survive\nIf you waver you're disqualified, move, it just begun\n\nMurderous looks keeping each other in check\nWhen I turned around after running for a long time\nI had lost my innocence and became a villain\nNo one will ever forgive me\nI will survive as I live\nI must survive until the end\nYeah~\n\nThe sound of shouting fills the hall\nThe hand gesture that forces more stimulation\nA layer is taken off, fully gesturing erotically\nEven though it looks beautiful, the inside is mangled from rotting\nI successfully endured with a sober mind\nOne person pours tears, saying it's now too much\nThis reality tangled with lies and impossible insistence\nI'm scared to face it\nBrightly colored balloons, plank card slogans\nTake those out then everything else is criticism or resentment\nNo one knows, the saint becomes the right path\nA chance to talk without being cursed at is given\nParents who boast about their precious daughter\nThe dust that enters their mind, their eyes\nEngulfed in the feeling of betrayal, they shake their heads\nDid they achieve their dream or lost it?\n\nMurderous looks keeping each other in check\nWhen I turned around after running for a long time\nI had lost my innocence and became a villain\nNo one will ever forgive me\nI will survive as I live\nI must survive until the end\nYeah~\n\nROMANIZED HANGUL\nDongiteugijeone nuneultteo\nIbane darkgaseumsal,yangsangchureulleoheo\nHangangeuro ttwicheonaga maratoneul ttwieo\nBinhyeolsuchineun oreugo saksineun ssusyeo\n\nWanjumotae yeoroesi palguphyeopyeogi myeochoe\nBabeun meokdoe nunchitbap,meokgo tohaenaemyeondoe\nHeorittireul joyeomae fxxk jogeum jjyeonne\nDaepyonimeun wonhae kollabyeong gateun mommae\n\nAguneun eopda dongnyoga got jeogirae\nPiwa gateun ttam chamhokhan heunjeogidoen\nYeonseupsil mot gyeondilsi hwajangsilga\nMollae jiljiljja ganeunghan hyeopsohage cheorihae\n\nUseonsunwineun oemo\nGeupgiya seonghan eolgure kareuldaego\nChegyejeogin inganbyeonggijejo\nMusic bullshit?
