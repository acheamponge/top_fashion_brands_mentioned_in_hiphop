No, no, no\nMy heart is beating, I'm alive like a baby\nToday is the day that I succeed\n\nIt's been a long, long time\nIt took a while to find my way\nIt's been a long, long time\nBut I got it now\n\nHello sunshine, it's time to get on the road again\n'Cause you been sleeping far too long\nA cup of coffee will sure wake you up, I know\nOpportunities knocking at your door\n\nIt's been a long, long time\nIt took a while to find my way\nIt's been a long, long time\nBut I got it now\n\nBeen a long time, been a long time\nGot it now\nBeen a long time, been a long time\nGot it now\n\nIt's been a long, long time\nIt took a while to find my way\nIt's been a long, long time\nBut I got it now\n\nBut I got it now\nBut I got it now\nBut I got it now\nYes, I got it now\nYes, I got it now\nYes, I got it now"}], "artist": "Nicole Wray"}
