A watch with no face\nThey hit the ceilin', but my roof likes space\nI took my chances so won't you\n\n[Chorus]\nBlame it on me (Ayy)\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault\nBlame it on me (Ayy)\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault\nI couldn't breathe\nAlmost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all\nYou can't blame it on me (Ayy)\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault, not my fault\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's all my fault that I'm addicted to the clothes\nIt's all my fault, I paid the cost, yeah\nIt's all my fault that I ain't givin' up my soul\nIt's all my fault\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWatchin' me bleed (Watchin' me bleed)\nYou cut me down on my knees (You cut me down on my knees)\nNo matter what you believe\nI think we both can agree\n\n[Chorus]\nThat you can't blame it on me (Ayy)\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault\nBlame it on me (Ayy)\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault\nI couldn't breathe\nAlmost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all\nYou can't blame it on me (Ayy)\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault\n\n[Outro]\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault\nBlame it on me, yeah\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault", "year": "2018-04-27"}]}
