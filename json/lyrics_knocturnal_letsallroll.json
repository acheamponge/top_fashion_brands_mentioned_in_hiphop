Confidential, up in the place to be\nRide, ride with me - )\n\n[Hook: Butch Cassidy]\nLet's all roll, throw it up if you're with me\nI'm so cold, who am I but stayin' G\nTha Dogg Pound spreads the word, I know y'all heard\nPlease take heed when I speak or you'll get served\n\n[Verse 2: Slip Capone]\nYou know the gangstaz hang, gangstaz bang\nAnd gangstaz slang, it's just a gangsta thang\nCause gangstaz dip and some gangstaz trip\nI'm the gangsta Slip and this Gangsta Crip\nI used to bump Brotha Lynch and Ganksta Nip\nCause wasn't nobody else up on that gangsta tip\nGangstaz smoke sherm and gangstaz rock perms\nGangstaz don't listen and gangstaz don't learn\nGangstaz rock braids and gangsta jheri curls\nGangstaz gon' take over the world\nGangstaz go to jail but gangstaz skip bail\nGangstaz make mail, a gangsta won't ever fail\nGangstaz - gon' stay on top\nBecause a gangsta gon' make the gangsta shit pop\nJust lounge homeboy, you in the gangsta zone\nHawthorne, California where the gangstaz roll\n\n[Hook: Butch Cassidy]\nLet's all roll, throw it up if you're with me\nI'm so cold, who am I but stayin' G\nTha Dogg Pound spreads the word, I know y'all heard\nPlease take heed when I speak or you'll get served\n\n[Verse 3: Jayo Felony]\nMy nigga Slip is a gangsta\nBut cuhz, I'm a hoodsta or hood star\nAnd I'm takin' the hood far\nLittle C-riders posted up with the bullet loco blue rags\nSmokin' the bomb and fluid and keep dumpin' on you fags\nI heard and seen it all, I'm hopin' I ball\nKeep on lickin' them loco nuts until I get Crip balls\nI'm still strivin', yea, you worried about what I'm drivin'?\nYour bitch needs to give me more pedal to the floor\nFuck a Navigator, nigga I can flip ten gators in my living room\nIf you can't do that, nigga give me room\nHad a ???? '89, but see your bitch made me mines\nSee them motherfuckin' rims on that brand new Benz? bitch they be mine\nFor mine I did the crime, had to run from one-time\nAnd you bet I can't fit my dick all in your mouth at one time\nI fuck your mammi in the butt and Crip Walk on your liver\nWhile I'm rich rollin' on a river, bitch\n\n[Verse 4: Knoc-Turn'al]\nCaught up in a land of hard times, back off mine\nMash while pushin' a hard line\nA hard cat, with hard raps and hard rhymes\nI hardly pay attention to rats\nBut my mind says hard dick served to a bitch ain't no crime\nCook soft dope to hard dimes\nChicken - by the way I flip mine\nI hard hit and grip like canines\nI target hard heads with no spine\nMarch in and start to take mine\nBig D let me fuck that bitch and you fuck mine\nOff hard liqour it's hard to unwind\nKnoc-turn'al comes through in overtime\nWhen I die build me a shrine\nI'm as - hard as hard can get\nIn my mind I ain't begun to spit yet, and until that time -\n\n[Outro: Butch Cassidy]\nLet's throw it up, throw it up , let 'em know\nOut in the West, represent, let it go\nLet's throw it up, throw it up , let 'em know\nOut in the West, represent, let it go\n\n(L-L-A.C.)"}]}
