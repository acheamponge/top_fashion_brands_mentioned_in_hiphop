{"songs": [{"lyrics": "Open eyes, light the joint, take a piss\nMake two farm fresh scrambled eggs with the grits\nClassic club soda, splash with the twist, lime\nPlaced on my wrist: custom Swiss time\nHit the slopes, custom case for the smoke\nLifted up, flour for the cake getting sifted up\nMake it fluffy... poof\nBring your fucking buttcheeks here... boof\nMan, I fucking stand on my own, pockets getting thick like Luthor\nHundred dollars all it takes to get a kid to shoot ya\nDip to the Red Roof Inn, have a sandwich\nAt 7:30, on the Greyhound back to Kansas\nMy life is written, you sittin' while you pissin'\nI'm only sittin' if I'm shittin'\nAnd I'm shittin' often, I'm a boss\nSmokin' while I'm coughin'\n50 piece, a mummy that was laid inside the coffin\nExtract the blood from the mosquito\nIn the amber, Deion Sanders on my feet inside the Regal\nMy shorty tan, last name Esposito\nAnd gettin' money every day my destiny though\nYou could mistake me for a truck driver\nOn the strip, paying 30 for a muff diver\nShe had the red pussy hairs like a brush fire\nPeace to Jamaican big girl, 'nuff iyah\n\n[Outro]\nGirl, why you running from me? Bitch I adore you\nCome back sit in the chair baby you're royal\nNo one above you, need you in my life\nWhat I would do without you? I need you\nStandby\nPlease don't go", "title": "I Adore You", "album": "Blue Chips 2", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3tkvpk6nyazea6ub0nsnj8s01.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2013-11-01"}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
