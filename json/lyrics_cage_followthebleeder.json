We\u2019re going to fire\nAnd I made my peace with that, I\u2019m exempt here\nBut I hope you see all you friends and family when you get there\n\n[Hook]\nCause you\u2019re just hanging around, I dig that\nIt\u2019s all for fun until I\u2019m carried away\nWhy drag you down? I don\u2019t wanna fake this\nAs much as I can stomach the hate\nAnd where I\u2019m going is so hot\nI can\u2019t take anymore of me so I give it away\nDon\u2019t follow me to Hell, I will climb out\nI can\u2019t afford what you want me to pay\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn pieces, you need to keep this\nSo you and your leeches can feed your weakness\nSo hard to reach, it\u2019s gotta be easy to manipulate you\nWith sweetness and do it to feed this\nSee who the creep is, you were in my head from the street cause\nI was in your head from the speakers\nAnd I know it\u2019s playing romance and death again over dinner on a plane\nBut kill me if I don\u2019t remember your pain\nPretend you can just befriend me, would it seep in\nCould I drown with a girl kicking her legs in the deep end?\nNot if it\u2019s the end, now if there's some shit in the sky\nAbout to kill us we can see then\n\n[Hook]"}]}
