So sick I make you mentally vomit\nThese rappers askin' for beats and they ain't even fit to be on it\nI see 'em writin' about rappers, I should be sick to my stomach\nBecause they talk 'bout the future but didn't mention me on it\nSo now I'm back in the kitchen, cookin' I'm meant to be one of the greatest\nNo niggas seein' me, this century us and you hate it\nLook how I played it, other niggas was jaded\nUnder-appreciated, now Carolina is rated\nI let Elite breathe, yeah\nHey, uh uh uh\nI let Elite breathe, yeah\n\n[Hook]\nAye you ain't gotta cry, don't worry 'bout me\nI know it won't be long 'fore you hear about me\nMy head's to the sky and I'm on my grind\nI'm reachin' for the clouds, tryna take what's mine\nTake what's mine\nHey, hey"}], "artist": "J.
