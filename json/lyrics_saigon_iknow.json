There\u2019s only one particular race\nThat got fucked ever since we got shipped to the States\nLike being trapped in a pit full of snakes.  They\u2019re calling the coke\nDandruff\u2014the ghetto been infected with flakes\nI listen to rap but wouldn\u2019t let my kid listen to that\n\u2018Cause if my kid listen to that, then it\u2019s a wrap\nNiggas replace wisdom with materialism\nI use the rhythm to preach about imperialism\nI get on it like Martin Luther King and do the damn thing\nFar as snitching go, I\u2019m like J-Lo\u2014I can\u2019t sing\nBut I\u2019ll eat you like a planet wing.

How many\nLives must heroin cut short?  How many black folk\nGotta grow up to smoke, shoot, sniff, or snort? (Damn...)\nWe\u2019re no longer serving them dimes to maneuver through turbulent\nTimes, me and my niggas murdering rhymes, my life\nRead like a verse in the psalms, so it\u2019s in the Quran\nWord, bond, y\u2019all gon\u2019 worship the \u2018Gon.  Con-\n-vict since a young age, face plastered on the front page\nPicture me working for minimum wage.  I went in\nA rage, packed the MAC-10 and the gauge.  In\nThe streets, I seen more action than Nicholas Cage\nBuck one for my niggas locked for using a gun\nBuck two, hit them niggas that bucked Rule\u2014fuck you!\nBuck three for Lucky, buck four for all my dawgs\nUp north.
