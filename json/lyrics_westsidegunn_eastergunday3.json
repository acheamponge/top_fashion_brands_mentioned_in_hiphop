they comfort me\nThough prepareth the table before me, in the presence of my enemies\nHe has super S on his feet, so he thought he had an S on his chest with that bulletproof vest\nBut we coming for your dome piece\nShot to the forehead, give you a third eye\nMake your kids cry, baby mama asking why\nAll bow down to the god of Fly\n\n[Break: Westside Gunn]\nGrr, ayo\nBoom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom\nAyo\nGriselda\nBrr brr brr\nBy Fashion Rebels\n\n[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]\nAyo, I don't leave without my pistol on\nDrive-bys, I'm playing XXXTENTACION\nSoon as the box hit the skrt, I'ma get him gone\nShoot up your mama house, your uncle brains on the lawn\nBlew your nephew off the tricycle, shots ripple\nLike the PSI, Lord, you not official\nOn the yard, me and Blue DaVinci, shooters with me\nWent to the halfway house, I took the Uzi with me\nSkating over weight on the Palace deck, I'm not impressed\nPeace to little Sean, peace to Bernadette (P!)\nGxFR, that's the murder set\nEverybody got dope, but I serve the best\nEverybody taking my shit\nShoot the 8 three times, I might break my wrist\nTook 6, came back, now I'm better than ever\nAmiri jeans, alligator on the sweater, who better?\nI mean, I guess it's Fahim\nHe still chopping heads off of guillotines, nigga, please\nNinja stars in the trees, come on, fam\nWe ain't the same, you ain't never seen a thousand grand\nYou ain't never shot a nigga, no Con Air trips\nNever been fly, never fucked a bad bitch\nLil nigga, I'm rich\nI heard the Dump Legend shit sound like shit\nMask on like Vader, training like al-Qaeda\nMach retired, nigga turned to a painter\nMeanwhile, I'm getting paper\nYo, these rap niggas weirdos\nVVSs on my earlobes\nShit, the creator of the sun\nNiggas tryna fit in, that's a Camouflage Bum\n\n[Break: Westside Gunn]\nYo, you already fucking know\nI wasn't even gon' do this shit\nI had to, though\nBut fuck it, man, shoutout Easter, man\nI'm just having fun, I wrote this shit in like 5 minutes\nI don't waste time on these niggas\nSmoking skittles\nI'm not gon' even do this shit no more\nI don't give a fuck if niggas make some shit\nTalk some shit, tweet some shit\nI ain't even gon' see it anyway, niggas blocked me\nBut yo, I was just-\nI just wanted to have some fun, man\nLet niggas know why I'm who the fuck I am, man\nFlygod\nSee, like, I still do what I want to\nI only drink champagne\nI wear six figures in jewels\nI got all type of houses\nI'm 'bout to buy my bitch some titties\nAnd like, like, life is fucking beautiful\nPootie getting that Gucci\nThat Louis, shoutout to Pootie\nBut, yo, before, Mach was on these shits\nShit happens\nCan I get my painting, Mach?\nBut it's all about Griselda\nSee, this a different kind of life\nNiggas really put the work in\nNiggas been in the raids\nNiggas lost our best niggas\nRest in peace Machine Gun Black\nNiggas been shot, niggas been stabbed\nNiggas been in that hole\nNiggas been locked up, 23 and 1\nFree Ike, free Sly\nNiggas been told on\nNiggas done took them trips\nI remember one time, niggas had me shackled\nFrom- from Buffalo to fucking Youngstown, Ohio\nSat there for a week in shackles\nAll the way to PA\nShackled, got on Con Air, flew all the way to Oklahoma\nLeft Oklahoma, shackled, had to fly all the way to Atlanta\nSee, y'all niggas don't know that life\nWhere you don't eat the meat, so you share for the motherfucking fruit, nigga\nY'know?\nGet ready for Chris Benoit\nAKA Supreme Blientele\nGet ready\nClassic, the album really called Chris Benoit\nAlso known as Supreme Blientele, nigga\nEither one\nIt's gonna be the illest shit all year\nBut you know who else got some of the illest shit all year?\n\n[Verse 2: Benny]\nAh, let's go\nSki mask, crooked faces, this rap shit took us places\nMy strap get put in faces, that's word to my butcher apron\nAround the world, I'm good with gangsters, I got good relations\nAll it took was patience, now I'm on, so they book us places\nLet me catch you fronting, you just wanna be pop\nYou want the buzz, you want the love, but you don't want to get shot\nHow you don't want what come with it, you just want to be hot\nTo be Griselda, nigga, you gotta stand on one of these blocks\nI was feeding them, stove on medium, under each pot\nRolling reefer up, while I'm speeding off the company lot\nAye, look, West told me chill, but I know where the nigga live\nLike Sopranos, nigga, tie you up, right in that little crib\nGet the tape, then throw the pillowcase right on your little head\nWe would search the crib for cake, but know you don't get no bread\nFuneral status, G shit, I could give 'em passes\nMy team like, \"what's good with the action\", we could give them caskets\nLook, 6 shooters, 8 heaters, 6 bodies, 8 creatures\nPlay with me, I make you famous quicker than a Drake feature\nI be rocking Off-White, and I be rocking BAPE sneakers\nI mix that with Fendi shit like I don't got no taste neither\nHopping at the Rattison got me shopping on Madison\nYou talking all that fashion shit but cop it from the Africans\nThat don't start none, it won't be none\nY'all know who run the streets, huh? Griselda\nWe gon' see when Tana Talk 3 come\nGot my hammer in the trap, I watch the camera like a rerun\nUndercover, caught with scanners, throw your hand up when you see one\nIt's Easter Gunday, I need a runway\nI let the clip talk, niggas think I'm Rick Ross, I be with gunplay\nYou grind hard, you could reach this one day\nI learned the game young, and knew that I would teach it some day\nI'm bool, you know the rules when you play in these streets\nYou smooth, cock the tool, now you playing for keeps\nDon't pray for us, nigga, make sure you pray for the weak\nI bump into a bird, nigga, I'ma scrape up his feet\nI just booked a flight to Cali, I'ma stay for the week\nMy bitch coming, while I work, I let her play on the beach\nThe ways of the streets, I rob just to stay on my feet\nI'm at niggas, rap niggas see this face and they sleep\n\n[Outro: Benny]\nThe Butcher\nGriselda, nigga\nYou know what it is\nHahaha, let's go", "image": "https://images.genius.com/51270d593f6e1a6ebe2683d4933b8373.500x500x1.jpg", "album": null, "title": "Easter Gunday 3"}]}
