{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSince the last time I seen you boo I been around the world\nDrugs is gettin' twirled, while driving something absurd\nSomething you never seen, gold and forest green\nLeanin', growl like a demon, the tires smoking when I'm leaving\nPlaying poker on the river boat\nHid the ace long rifle in my bitch's coat\nFlip off the balcony, knife to the throat, ice in the coke\nCoke on the table, wild n' out in Roanoke\nHall & Oates we at the benefit for wild owls\nThey had the freshwater bass served five styles\nFlix with Ellen DeGeneres rockin' Perry Ellis\nBeen a degenerate cutting ribbons with senators\nKnock on my door with balloons and that big check\nI'm not surprised though still dippin the 5-0\nIt's all about survival, me and Supplies man alive on arrival\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got the drugs rolled perfect\nThe gold turkish, flow furnace\nI been a earner, just call me earnest\nLeave the logistics to attorneys, but if its money it concerns me\nYo wake the fuck up tell my bitch to pull the truck up\nHad the marijuana rolled up bitch this shouldn't be a hold up\nSo much paper it don't fold up, grab the plastic it won't mold up\nI'm on the boat smoking gold dust\nI marry ya niece, cash me out in Paris for fleece\nShoot the back of ya knees, Gary Sinise\nSpeaking Arabic in Greece\nGrown men turn the keys to cheese, as I water ski Belize\n\n[Verse 3]\nI seen a lot but I ain't seen it all\nDreams to ball but I ain't talking bout Seton Hall\nHot red Lamborghini, special seat and all\nPlus the doors open up like a season whore\nNow you motherfuckers are sour, wishin' you had the vision\nCould've been doing division, stay in the coupe like a pigeon\nApartment is getting close to the roof ya boy is risen\nGreek men, jump off the back of the boat for dinner\nBarehanded snatch up a octopus I'm a winner\nGrill it, hit it with olive oil and lemon\nThen kiss my fingers, efharisto that was delicious\n\n[Outro]\n[Applebee's Commercial]", "title": "It Concerns Me", "album": "Blue Chips 2", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3tkvpk6nyazea6ub0nsnj8s01.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2013-11-01"}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
