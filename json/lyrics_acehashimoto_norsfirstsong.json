I\u2019m trying to live my life out to the fullest\nBut now it\u2019s like, I\u2019m trying to live my life out like a Buddhist\n\u2018Cause I ain\u2019t saying a word, but be one with the ruler\nAnd all that I really know is that you\u2019re living, no rove\nAnd you\u2019re not into the guys that rock the bullets\nI\u2019m at the end of the road, you\u2019re two seats to the right\nI should be sitting next to you, but it\u2019s all on me\nI don\u2019t want to walk to the lows, I had to walk on my toes\n\u2018Cause I think you might be a little taller than me\nBut yet and still, I feel like there could really be a chance\nIf I could turn from my friends and give you a chance\nLooks like I\u2019m gonna end this hype with my face in my hands\nHow to sneak a cue from Cupid, but nah that nigga is stupid\nI\u2019m sorry, I left before the credits could fly\nWalked out of the movie theater and didn\u2019t say bye\nI couldn\u2019t believe that I choked like I was some number one fan\nCouldn\u2019t even say \u201cgood night\u201d, I just grabbed my friends and ran\nSo much for future plans, us building castles in the sand\n\u2018Cause now it\u2019s all over and I won\u2019t get another chance\nDamn, now I\u2019m on my way home\nThat\u2019s when I got a call on my phone\n\n[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]\nShe says, \u201cYou might not be the coolest, but I swear you are the cutest\nAnd I really like your music, I heard you on MySpace\nD.O.A. really almost brought tears to my face\nAnd I bet you were probably just giving me my space\nWhen you sat so far, I could tell that you were nervous\nSo better than you try to touch on me like a pervert\nBut that was kind of rude, how you just walked out\nIt\u2019s bad enough that you didn\u2019t have nuts to talk about\nWell, don\u2019t beat yourself up \u2018cause I\u2019m not that mad\nBut this really was the most awkward date that I had\nYou lost a few cool points, but I got a few for ya\n\u2018Cause you remembered that my name was Nor and not Nora\nYou remembered the fish and the dog that I have\nDr. Pepper is my fave and I love slow craft\nSo with that said, it\u2019s getting late\nCall me tomorrow around eight\u201d\n\n[Outro: brandUn DeShay (sample)]\n(How you feeling right now?)\nI feel like\u2026 a million bucks\n(Is y\u2019all there?)\nOh, I\u2019m here\nI\u2019m ready to go\nLovely\n(How you feeling right now?)\n(Yeah me too)", "year": "2008-08-26", "album": "Volume: One!
