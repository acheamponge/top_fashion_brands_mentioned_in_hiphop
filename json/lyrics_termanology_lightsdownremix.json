'\nBig up to my fans and all of my squad\nYou can call me what you want, just call me an icon\n\n[Hook:]\nI'm a turn the bass up, you can turn the lights down\nIf you ain't had enough, you gon get it right now\nGet it right now, get it right now\nIf you ain't had enough, you gon get it right now\nGet it (get it) like now, get it like now\nTurn the (turn the) the bass up, you can turn the lights down\nIf you ain't had enough, you gon get it right now\nIf you ain't had enough, you gon get it right now\n\n[Verse 2:]\nSometimes it's just me and my subwoofer, the lows\nA life can leave you rattled and shattered and yes it shows\nThe high don't come as often as my TV screen\nWith fallin I called the search off of my meaning\nI guess I just proceed to crawl on the curb\nCaddy-cornered Cadillacs, the aftermath erotic\nClean, this ho don't know just how to act\nEvery day's a new country, I don't know just how to pack\nIndestructible flow, bitch I don't know how to crack\nUnder pressure, since Wechsler, on the ball court\nDestined to be a major leaguer even as a small sport\nNever was for the alrights, or the almost\nIf you ain't gon make it count, what you askin for the ball for?\nShuckin jives, stickin move out my way, I got shit to do\nOne more time for country bumpkins, we ain't got shit to prove\nLyrical, mobster in my own right\nI had to be a king in my past life\nKrizzle\n\n[Hook:]\nI'm a turn the bass up, you can turn the lights down\nIf you ain't had enough, you gonna get it right now\nGet it right now, get it right now\nIf you ain't had enough, you gonna get it right now\nGet it (get it) like now, get it like now\nTurn the (turn the) the bass up, you can turn the lights down\nIf you ain't had enough, you gonna get it right now\nIf you ain't had enough, you gonna get it right now\n\nTurn the bass up\nTurn the lights down\nRight now\nRight now\nGet it like now"}], "artist": "Termanology"}
