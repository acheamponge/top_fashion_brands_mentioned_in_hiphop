Lewis]\nGet you, get you on the floor\nKitchen table, say no more\nGot you up against the door\nRun it up 'til the morning\nNever trippin', on the low\nHit it fast, hit it slow\nRun it up 'til the morning\n\n[Chorus: B. Lewis]\nI just gotta know\nCan we do this on the low\nTake it fast or take it slow\nReally doesn't matter anymore, baby\n\n[Post-Chorus: Bas and B. Lewis]\nEvery time, my favorite times are wastin' time with you\nLove you sober, love you older, love you always, through\nForever might not need no wedding ring\nNowhere I'd rather be but here with you\nThis world, the seven seas, the Heavens too\nNo part of it I see compare with you\n\n[Chorus: B. Lewis]\nI just gotta know\nCan we do this on the low (Oh)\nTake it fast or take it slow\nReally doesn't matter anymore, baby\n\n[Verse 2: Bas]\nYeah\nThat's a fact, scientific\nWhat's a Jordan with no Scottie Pippen?\nI'll be Scottie, baby, you the greatest\nGot no problems givin' you the praises\nCop a drop for you, the new Mercedes\nYou deserve the latest\nBein' honest, I could loop you daily\nBaby, you is something like my favorite playlist\nBut I could never play you like the stereo from Shea Stadium\nIt ain't Shea Stadium, but these days\nIt ain't rented and it auto-park\nAnd she got back like a photobomb\nThrow that ass back, no photoshop\nIndependent, had to shoot my shot (Ayy)\nUber Eats, big movie screens\nShit, fuck, and sleep\nI could do this all day\n\n[Chorus: B. Lewis]\nI just gotta know\nCan we do this on the low (Oh)\nTake it fast or take it slow\nReally doesn't matter anymore, baby\n\n[Post-Chorus: Bas and B. Lewis]\nEvery time, my favorite times are wastin' time with you\nLove you sober, love you older, love you always, through\nForever might not need no wedding ring\nNowhere I'd rather be but here with you\nThis world, the seven seas, the heavens too\nNo part of it I see compare with you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5cbb892ecd4fe9e96be43f0d10b8dc3a.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2019-08-09", "title": "Nirvana", "album": "Spilled Milk 1"}]}
