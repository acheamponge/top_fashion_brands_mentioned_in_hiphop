named smart dog\nNow what these 2 nickel slicked niggas had in common\nWas that they could run game on motherfuckers\nLike it want nothing but a thang'\nYa' see\nWhat fast black was\nHe was a thieving motherfucker\nI mean the nigga was so good\nHe could still stink outta shit if he wanted too\nBut ya see on the other hand\nSmart dog had more of the players hustlers touch\nIf ya know what i mean\nNow how these 2 motherfucker operated\nI mean the shit that fast black use to take\nHe gone give to the nigga named smart dog\nThe pimps the ho's the whole 9 yards\nOn the street\nYa know what

underground\nAnd these motherfuckers gonna go like this\n\n\n[Verse 1] Koke\nNow this is not a ticket to the colour of skin\nOnly giving you a view of how i make my ends\nI'd like to introduce myself, my name is fast-black\nWelcome to the world of booze, bitches and paybacks\nFrom the land down under\nFast-black is the man to strike ya ass like thunder\nSo i procede to be a nigga that'll take your shit\nA number 1 player thats out for the big hit\nAnd if ya flaunt that grip\nI think you'll last pop up like jack in a box\nAnd smoke that ass\nSuprise, suprise\nI bet you think im trippin\nIm taking all your goods\nCause i finally caught you slipping\nTip toed in the hood to my homie to get paid\nCause my alluring posture was kinda of big\nWell what do you do\nI persist to use my street bid\nCause i'm what is known as a\nInner city hoodlum\n\n[Sample]\nPlaying' motherfucker and i'm in demand\n\nSshow you right\nNow fast black was known for handling things\nI mean that nigga was a blast from the past\nGive you a mega dose of insulin\nTo give you a funky reaction\nBut on the other hand\nOn the other side of the b side that is\nWas a sly ass nigga\nThat had to make mo' money\nNow
