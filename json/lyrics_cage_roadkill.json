I'm sorry I lied\n\nYour aim is off so is your point of view\nWhen the hand of god pointed at you\nHe said you were designed to grow up and go slut\nGave you a pretty face, nice tits, and no butt\nIf getting away with murder ain't the way to be\nThen getting bitches all rapey/rabies[?] okay with me\nWhy would I care who\u2019s fake and living major lies\nI don\u2019t relate, placate or plagiarize\nSave that talk for your friends or go home\nI know you're fly, I'm the shit and won't leave me alone\n\nThe word storm kept her underwear warm\nTill she dripped on the floor then she slipped out the door\nAnd you like my circle I can tell\nCause you're starry like Orion's belt\nI looked in death's eyes through my shades\nHe winked and then ignored me\nOne look in yours I know your lily white story\n\nI was underground like this very garage\nA car came around better wizardry than Oz\nSlipped a 20 said thanks for taking care of this\nShe jetted in a 9-11 like a couple terrorists\nAnd I know it's mundane\nI'm pharmaceutically lobotomizing my brain\nCo-sign don't need a notary\nTrying to steer with this bitch's head and hands all over me\n\nCome dummy\nI already took your lunch money\nFed her on the 101 doing 120\nAnd I'm driving trashed of course\nLike I'm the first white dude to crash a Porsche\nEven though my name's seen\nThat shit's invisible compared to James Dean\nMy report wouldn't be history\nMake sure I'm cremated so nobody can piss on me\nI should drop you off, call it a day\nI've got zero condoms anyway\n\nSo where you going?"}]}
