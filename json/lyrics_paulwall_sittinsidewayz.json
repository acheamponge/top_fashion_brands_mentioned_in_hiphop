Farris\nOpen mouth and showcase ice, and you gon' see about 20 karats\nI'm with that Gu U on 5-9-double-O\nIn the Tahoe on 24's I'm the truth, I got that glow\nI'm out that Swisha House with Archie Lee and Coota Bang\nSittin' sideways on swang, the candy paint dripping off the frame\nYou see me acting bad, I'm showing out and pulling stunts\nSay \"cheese\" and show my fronts, it's more karats than Bugs Bunny's lunch\nIt's Paul Wall baby, I got it made\nI got a cup full of that oil and I'm paid plus I'm...\n\n[Chorus]\nSittin' sideways, paused in a daze\nSittin' sideways, paused in a daze\nSittin' sideways, paused in a daze\nOn a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze\n\n[Verse 2: Paul Wall]\nWhat it do, I'm on the block posted up like a mailbox\nSlanging licks on the grind, putting money in my socks\nA legend in the hood for gold grills and poppin' seals\nA icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills\nI'm in the club posted up with some gangbangers\nStill flipping the old school candy Cadillac on swangers\nI got a styrofoam white cup full of that drank\nLooking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank\nBig bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint\nTryna find some Honey Love, my macking game is top rank\nThese hoes peeping me, ear hustling on the side\nEavesdropping my conversation, tryna figure which car I drive\nI'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping\nHit the corner you hear me bumping, look at that cold grill and woman\nThe trunks popped up, my music screwed and chopped\nI'm the undisputed king of the parking lot, I'm\n\n[Refrain]\nSittin' sideways, paused in a daze\nSittin' sideways, paused in a daze\nSittin' sideways, paused in a daze\nOn a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze\n\nSittin' sideways, paused in a daze\nSittin' sideways, paused in a daze\nSittin' sideways, paused in a daze\nOn a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze\n\n[Verse 3: Big Pokey]\nMaybe O'Jays, hoes be going crazy when they see me\nSittin' sideways on them 24's, watch ya ho\nBunch of money, bunch of clothes, Cigarillos, Optimos\nGlidin' like a ice skater, motor like a snot nose\nSuicide drop doors, mono blocks, chop mold\nCustomized deck, cause the mono block stock lows\nSensei, Don 'Ke, Paul Wall in the place\nHeads up when you see us, we gon' put it in ya face\nRaised on Scott in the Yella\nWhen I blaze, boys smell lemon haze, I ain't the nigga to settle\nI'm that dude with the metal, that get hot as a kettle\nFrom messing 'round with some cat that ain't got it together\nFlossing, breaking off intersection, crossing\nThree-wheelin' acting a iz-ass on them Bosses\nS.U.C. in the door, M.O.B. on the plate\nPull up in the driveway leanin' and I'm...\n\n[Refrain]\nSittin' sideways, paused in a daze\nSittin' sideways, paused in a daze\nSittin' sideways, paused in a daze\nOn a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze\n\nSittin' sideways, paused in a daze\nSittin' sideways, paused in a daze\nSittin' sideways, paused in a daze\nOn a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze", "year": "2005-08-20"}]}
