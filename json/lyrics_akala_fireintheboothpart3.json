{"songs": [{"title": "Fire In The Booth Part 3", "lyrics": "Whoever's more human must have the right to do the abusing\nI imagine that means you then\nOr are you men just as clueless\nFoolish fools, thoughts of a tortured soul\nBought for a quarter of gold\nOne little sand nigga slaughter it whole\nWhy not? They don't have souls\nThey love their children less than we do so they are less than equal\nThey abuse women so we kill them cos they are bloody villains\nThat's right, we are the feminists\nFor the women of the world, kill terrorists\nLiberate them from their burqas\nThey feel more free with their children murdered\nI know that it sounds absurd but lemme explain it a little bit further\nWe're so superior our missiles whistle until they tickle\nLittle itty bitty grandchildren and make them giggle\nBut their laughter sounds like screaming I told you that they were demons\n\nThey pretend to be dead to make us feel sad\nPut bullets in their head to make us feel bad\nBut we're never anything other than glad\nWhen those that look funny end up in a body bag\nBut if a hair is harmed on Sally or Brad or\nEven a dog we cry like mad\nA dog is a man's best friend, not a girl\nWomen are abused all over the world and children are raped\nEvery place, every religion or creed or race\nEven fathers with daughters, uncles with nieces sweep it under the carpet\nRape is a weapon used by power, and we don't wanna look like bastards\nSo manufacture hero complex, a reaction to nuttin' more complex\nTo organise mass rape in a state, don't wanna hear about mass graves\nCos I hate to relate to a shade that's darker than you\nOne that prays under a different roof\nHas less dollars or pounds, crowns or gowns or crowns\nFill 'em up with rounds\nIf they mess with the way that things are constructed\nObstructing lines of production\nYou can buy anything, liposuction, seduction, just buy it from us, men\n\nBuy lies, can't buy truth\nNo-one's selling it there is no use\nThere is no customer base for the product\nWe'd rather buy some celebrity trollop\nCos our life is about getting one-up\nOn everybody else that we pass on a come up\nWe don't care what force bring the sun up\nBut lie in the sun every day gettin' bun up\nLie to the point that it's part of the culture\nTell the truth it's only the result of\nA double lie\nCancelling itself, their pride cancer in itself\nCos virus is normality living in a world that is built on vanity\nMore salaries, more calories, more thieving, more charities\nPicture a Moor on a horse with a chariot speaking some kind of African Arabic\nTeaching mathematics with Spaniard when maths had not got to Britannia\nCan you picture mind scripture\nThats designed for the mind to enrich you\nAre you blind can't you find the riddim pratt?\nCause your timing alignment is on crack\nIt's hard to be as far off the rhythm as you are, it's like art\nHard to have so little charisma, I swear that you try to be shit\nTo make me look even better than\nEverybody knows that I am already\nI'm a pedigree that can't be touched like leprosy\nHave a rapper like The Beatles begging me to let it be\nAnd I don't need no referee\nI play the game on my own, it's my own sport\nAnd you can't take a king to his own court\nYou can't take a king to his own court\nYou ain't the throne sort\nYou're the type to rap for five minutes\nAnd complain your throat's sore\nWhile I'm so sure that my stone jaw\nIs the coldest on road since '04\nBut these silly little boys think their so raw\nMake a bigger bit a noise but we know you're\n\nYou ain't up the game, you ain't match fit\nYou ain't even got the brain for the tactics\nYou ain't even on the bench you're a ballboy\nOne lickle send out yout so just sit down\nI am the Big Mic man with the crown\nSuper cat de pon sting with the sound\nWho are these silly little\nWollies?\nThink they erupt with enough of the guts to be on it\nTheir the version of me that I didn't wanna be\nI'm the coldest I wrote since Admiral Zheng He\nI'm the fire in the booth, you a wet rag\nYou ain't the real ting like a step-dad\nI'm the best so rest where the rest have\nDon't big up your chest, let your breasts sag\nI'm the best dad look, I don't even beat my sons\nI let them shine\nEven when they got no talent to rhyme\nInsist on doing it all of the time\nAll of my spine is re-enforced with a kind\nOf carbon that hardens the thoughts in my mind\nOf course you will find that I torture a line\nI'm born with bars, no-one ever taught me to rhyme\nThe portion that's mine, don't touch it\nFurthermore, don't even discuss it\nI know that you heard\n\nBritain's biggest export is weapons of death\nThat ain't a theory or a guess\nTake another breath and your country is next\nUnless you remind 'em whenever you're rhyming\nYou're a beast on the mic with impeccable timing\nThey will think you're in the league that I'm in\nBut that is most absurd\n\nI Turn a Stanza to a cancer with banter\nFor those between the gangster and a panther\nI know you seen me these man dem with their tantrums\nLike kids when I'm off on a tandem\nCos they don't know what a tandem means\nSo rather than use a dictionary they talk shit and badmouth me\nWhen I'm only tryina elevate your mind, G\nBut I don't watch that the love is more than a grands worth\nYou should see when I roll through Handsworth\nElders see me, cross the road, talk to me and it usually goes\nWe love how you bus up da ting, spread knowledge\nBunfire pon them Babylon college\nWe salute you, you're the future\nAll the bigger man have time for them yout deh\nWhat I'm saying it that the respect's worth\nMore than the chain on your neck\nWhen it's not that it's somebody's mum\nSaying that she feed me to her son\nCos she wanna come get his mind out of the slums\nAkala is smarter than Arthur your dumb\nRegardless the bars are retiredly dumb\nWhat the raises and the raated a part of my lung\n\nTake out a whole clique that chat's do do\nPic up a mic, we can see who's who\nI'm fire in the booth, you dry wood\nYour flesh best taste quite good\nSo smart but he still move quite hood\nSee him on the road but don't think that I try should\nThat's a wise assessment, kind of like land is a wise investment\nEspecially land that's recently blessed with\nIn excess of one million deaths in\nAnd the castle you rest in, that's a next ting\nBuilt on the bones and the flesh of the wretched\nThrone that you pose in, only protected\nCos we regret that only deceptive\nThings that we like, and only reject it\nWhen it feels like it's truth were digesting\nSo\nGet in with a blessed king\nWhose crown is the rounds that he fought\nTherefore you ain't gotta deal with the fraud\nOf all these picanees of whom I'm bored\n\nMy worst, stronger than their best\nAura alone stronger than their flesh\nAll that they known can't compare to his guess\nUsually don't ever dare to spit next\nIt's clear the reason is fear\nEven the worst MC has ears\nBut we can't hear where the beat is\nThe time is his flow with the kick and the snare\nWhen they hear me they know life ain't fair\nGod bless some and some get air\nLike these conscious heads that cry\nThat I get big headed and I don't know why\nCos I, I have always been this guy\nEver since mum sent for the sky\nI decided that that was too low\nSo I'm astral travelling to another zone\nYou won't ever get on the dog and the bone\nCos I don't ever really wanna answer my phone\nZone that I'm in is high vibration\nSee the future with mind meditation\nYour peeps, poor libation\nFor all the peeps that get above their station\nI place them in the right placement\nThat is to say I erase them\n\nAin't no-one above nor adjacent\nStill these mugs they want to get feisty\nBut face it they don't really wanna face me\nI don't run so you can't ever chase me\nAnd I been through tings on the pavement\nBut don't beg road fame cos I never made it\nMy uncles, cousins and friends have done everything that yours have mate\nBut I don't tell their story I tell mine\nThat means I'm real and you're fake\nThat said, I don't mind a bit of fiction\nIf you did tell your story well\nBut your raps are dryer than a dead man's top lip\nAfter six years of living in hell\nYou meet a nice girl, you just might gel\nMight be wifey, you can't quite tell\nYou know why? Cos the only bitch in the world\nIs a man and his ego he hides in a shell\nMine is harder than my uncles foot back\nWho don't even need to wear shoes\n\nWho only eats pounded yam and stew\nWith hands like a can on a man, I refuse\nWho said mum never raised no fools, your mum raised you\nYou're a plonker, a plank, a donut, a tool\nYou make me think that mother nature's cruel\nThen I get back and remember\nLife is a gift even when it don't look like it is\nAnd everybody thinks that they're cold in a booth\nGot no friends to show them the truth\nPut the pen down, become a spectator\nGo get a day job, there is no shame in it\nWe need doctors and architects\nNot more crap rappers that are passed their best\nAnd if the cap fits you wear it\nIf it fits your friend too share it\nI know it ain't the role of a parent\nTo take my child's confidence and tear it\nBut it is my role as a father\nTo show my son about life and it's harder\n\nWhen you got a dad named Akala\nThose are big shoes to fill, be your own man\nHave you own plan, your own destiny\nJust don't ever mess with me\nPreferably bun these fools for their treachery\nDefinitely those that put us in jeopardy\nEspecially foes that wanna pose next to me\nNobody ain't testing me\nIt's the versatility that is killing them\nSo road but I teach kids William\nListen to my albums I actually write songs\nAnd of course the bars are brilliant\nWe can do politics, spirituality\nOr real life road reality\nOr do this ting here with straight up vanity\nEither way, nobody can't battle me\nMuch less shackle me, the maroon\nOne man army, an entire platoon\nThey're like \"won't he run out of breath soon?\"\n\"How does he do that? Is he human?\"\n\nLook man, it's the spirit of boukman\nBack in the flesh in a terrible crook man\nThe law won't like me, ain't it obvious\nI ain't a paedophile, now a colonist\nI'm the MC that you don't wanna bother with\nTo gauntlet is thrown down, who's crossing it\nHmm, that's what I thought\nYou can have your whole life to retort\nStill won't think up the things that I thought\nWhen I was age four\nStrach that before I was born\nIn the womb when I was yet to be formed\nBefore that in a past incarnation\nWhen I set fire to a thieves plantation\nMe and Sam Sharpe hid in the cane fields\nTwo weeks straight totally stayed still\n\nWith nothing but a blade of great steel\nJumped on our enemies what a great kill\nSelf defence is not violence it's common sense\nThe first rule of nature, self preservation\nTo let people kill and abuse you is just self hatred\nTurn the other cheek, why?\nNo-one ever got their freedom that way, lies\nWhen the oppressed say an eye for an eye\nThey talk this crap about the world goes blind\nJust don't attack us in the first place\nAnd everything will be just fine\nIn the mean time train hard\nRead nuff, stay sharp\nAnd don't diss the sisters, are you barmy?\nYou are putting down half your army\n\nAny evolution without the women in the middle is no revolution at all\nTrust me you could be back through them all\nWomen were there ready to pop tools\nBut we have become so cowardly that\nRather than fight back we attack\nThe only ones that ever had our back\nAnd that is a actual fact\nAnd I ain't saying that I ain't ever done that\nI'm just saying that it's time that we bun that\nSo don't put my name in the same sentence\nAs real revolutionaries, I'm offended\nReal revolutionaries spend their life engaged in revolutionary acts\nAnd as cold as I am on the mic\nThus far, I just rap\n\nThat said there is no comparison\nTo cold for the way that I carry on\nThese vultures feed off carrion\nCome along now, carry on, carry on\nRoll up roll up, two for a pound\nBun down MC's bun whole sound\nBun your whole clique I bun the whole town\nTake a stroll at the speed of sound\nWho said the speed of light was the fastest thing\nNever knew the speed of darkness\nA black hole absorbs all light that there is\nSo how could light ever get past it?\nI studied the masters and sages\nSecret teachings of all of the ages\nI don't know, I can't explain it\nThe knowledge ain't mine yet I radiate it\nIt's why they write sixteen lines\nAnd I write an essay that rhymes\nAnd I never went uni neither\nBut my mind works just fine\n\nIn fact no need to be modest\nMy mind's a fine instrument If I'm honest\nAnd I promise that I'll show you where the bodies at\nBurying MC's my lickle hobby that\nAnd MC's don't bite me\nThey ain't got the technique to even copy that\nI think I made my point\nIn a manner that is more than adequate\nLet's put all the boasting aside\nI do know that I'm just channeling\nThis thing, what is it?\nInspiration, the source of the spirit?\nNot a man in the sky\nBut a force that animates all things that are living\nDali's brush, Akala's lyrics all things\nAin't explained by the laws of physics\nCos you've been down on your life\nDon't mean you'll ever be on top of it\nCos for this force right here\nThere ain't one that is equal and opposite", "year": null, "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/3222ca5815132f2ac56b73bacb186bf1.1000x672x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
