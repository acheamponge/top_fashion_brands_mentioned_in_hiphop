It's little DI in this bitch ho\nHappy that I'm white, but relieved I ain't a chick yo\nI never wake up and have to cake on ma make up\nOr straighten hair, I ain't given a damn\nI'm wearing whatever I wanna in this muthafucka\nThey up in heels\nAnd tummy tuckin, they don't grub except for takin' them pills, foreal...\nAnd ion't bleach shit\nIon't gotta eat dick\nI ain't bleeding up out ma penis\nSmoking the weed, ion't fall asleep because I'm cheefing\nIn disagreements, I participate without weeping\nAnd when I'm freaking, I'm getting daps, high fives, and all that\nMa rep goin up, and at best, ho a slut\nSo what up\nYa boy cut up\nBut eat butter\nAnd I ain't gotta speak to ma mother...to still love her\nAnd I been getting better looking with age\nBut a guy can get who he deserves wit a horrible face\n[Seal interlude]\nI go on dates, and never have to worry bout getting raped\nAnd I watch a game and never have to worry bout how it's played\nAnd I meet a babe and never have to act deliriously fake\nAnd if impregnate I can pack a bag and be on my way, but good luck girl!\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd y'ain't even want it wit da boy\nCuz the way I'm livin life, is a muthafuckin joy\nOn some grown man B.I\nI could have been a girl\nOr any ethnicity up in the world\nBut I'm rollin with the top back\nI ain't gotta worry where the cops at\nI ain't gotta wear a fucking bra strap\nMe and the crew\nAre really doing everything that we like to\nMan it's a damn good day to be a white dude\n\n[Outro]\nYeah... I'm happy as fuck man\nFirst off I'm a dude so\nThere was a one in two chance of that sucking\nBut now I can run a seven minute mile\nI can defend my self adequately\nI can be logical\nI can get along with my room-mates\nWatch serious movies without being scared by them\nAnd the on top of that I'm white\nWhich is like, amazing because\nEverybody naturally assumes I'm a great person\nI get a fair shot at the life I deserve\nI mean I could underachieve my way into any college in the country\nI get my hair cut at a salon\nPeople hold the door open for me which is nice\nEr, I never have to get into a fight, like, for social purposes\nAnd please don't take this as me just disparaging black people\nIt ain't about that\nIt's about me being happy that I'm white, know what I'm saying?\nBut on that note, could someone explain to me why Fat Joe, and any other person of Hispanic descent, is allowed to say the N-word\nI mean I guess it's unrelated but like that shit don't make any sense\nI've been thinking about that shit a lot\nBecause like if I could say the N-word, it would really help my rhyme scheme out\nIt's like the perfect filler word"}], "artist": "Lil Dicky"}
