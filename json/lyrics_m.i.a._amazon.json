Please, can I go home?\nI was sipping on a Rubicon, thinking 'bout where I come\nIt's all this for revolution\nCuttin' up the coupon, saving for a telephone\nCan I call home?

This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?\nHello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?\nHello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?\nHello! This is M.I.A., could you please come get me?\n\n[Verse 2]\nSmoking on a Benson, tryin' to get me undone\nLet me go, I don't want your attention\nUnder submission, out of frustration\nI'll do it, I'll scream for the nation\nSmoking on a Benson, tryin' to get me undone\nLet me go, I don't want your attention\nUnder submission, out of frustration\nI'll do it, I'll scream for the nation\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nPainted nails, sunsets on horizons\nPalm trees, silhouette smells amazing\nBlindfolds under homemade lanterns\nSomewhere in the Amazon, they're holding me ransom\nPainted nails, sunsets on horizons\nPalm trees, silhouette smells amazing\nBlindfolds under homemade lanterns\nSomewhere in the Amazon, they're holding me ransom\n\n[Chorus]\nHello!
