RIP Bo\nI wish all y'all niggas could enjoy the luxury that we've got right now\nIt's not too many real niggas left out here\nEverybody is claiming they true but they show they true colors at the end of the day\nNiggas is chameleons to me, just blending in with they surroundings\nULT for life"}], "artist": "Denzel Curry"}
