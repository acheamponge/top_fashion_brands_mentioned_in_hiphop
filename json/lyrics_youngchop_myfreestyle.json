We need to get are collar greens.One day I won't be able to escape. My faith. When they put that 45 enstended clip to my face.But that's ok.As long that mac can still spray.If the reeper don't stop it I be safe.These streets ain't no play thang. Where we slang 8 balls/ dog food/ and that goonja because me and my niggas is on that paper chase.I heard broscy found a new crack head the other he replaced.I told that thot not to get weed from bro her weed got lasted.Now she always coming to the trap house to get a new taste", "album": null, "year": "2013-12-19", "image": "https://images.genius.com/97ae02ce3d96becb8a467776bc1c6ee5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young Chop"}
