Huh, I doubt it punk\nPop the trunk, my goons, high noon, out to lunch\nThe D&G bag? That's where the weed stash\nKeep cash, breeze past, fuck y'all, eat glass\nMy tank on full, ease gas\nStay on point with the white, (like who?) Steve Nash\nGun go in the waist, dun' dough, I get cake\nMe and funeral Fab, front row at your wake\n\n[Hook: Vado]\nHit 'em up, shotty blast, zipped up, body bag\nFifth tucked, then what? Bullets hit your body fast\nWe beatin' murderers with the same lawyer Gotti had\nTie him to a pick-up truck and watch his body drag\n\n[Verse 2: Fabolous]\nFuneral, Killa, this just got very scary\nAll the competitions in the cemetery buried\nJesus piece, rosary, black white canary jerry\nPardon me, it's the God in me, marry Mary\nBut all them long stairs/stares ain't necessary, hear me?\nCannon with me, not the one Mariah Carey carry\nI'm talking sawed offs and 4 fizzys?\nFuck knocking on the door, to blow the doors off, it's more easy\nI'm at the top floor of the Wardarf, for four seazzys\nNickname, never caught off the floor seazzys\nTonight they lost?, ask Walt Frazier\nWe had a little bet, wouldn't say a vault breaker\nBut watch your mouth, I'm not the best insult taker\nI make them call the yellow tapers and the chalk tracers\nThey got names for niggas like y'all, it's called \"fakers\"\nThey should put anthrax in your salt shakers\n\n[Hook: Vado]\n\n[Verse 3: Vado]\nIn due time let your semi spray, they kidnap my slime\nOn a rainy day I got them back with two 9's and 20k\nTimberland boxes of plenty yay, more squares than?\nOur records carry? like a Fendi case. Huuhh!\nFour five meetings make a long day\nRap LeBron James 23 a whole ball game\nThat's what we call cane, black rocks, all dames\nNo slaves, suit and jewels, pin stripe, ball chain. Haa!\nSkinny nigga on his? shit\nBenz doors go up like the arms on the Karate Kid\nA cocky kid, no rappers but my pockets big\n\"Can I Live\" bumpin' pumpin' out my mamas crib\nBurners, mayhem murders\nGangland, double black suit, white tie off Space Jams\nI'm causing funeral arrangements, make plans\nI'm Paid In Full, y'all ain't rich like H-Man\n\n[Hook: Vado]", "title": "Body Bag"}]}
