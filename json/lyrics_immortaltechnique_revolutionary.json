(We're ready)\nWe gotta be prepared in this day and age, we gotta\nBe prepared for whatever comes the fuck at us. (Word up)\nCause we are living revolutionarily. (Definitely)\nYou cannot second guess yourself in these days and times\nThey're gonna throw whatever they can at you and you gotta\nBe prepared for it, you gotta be prepared for anything\n\n[Malcolm X]\n\"It's liberty or it's death\nIt's freedom for everybody or it's freedom for nobody!\"\n\n(Hook)\nNo matter what the fuck life throws at me\nI continue to make it through indefinitely\nImmortal Technique defeats the odds repetitively\nUntil there ain't shit ahead of me competitively\nSurviving the tough times is imperative to me\nLooking at the whole world revolutionarily\n\n[Malcolm X]\nThey don\u2019t want to hear you old Uncle Tom\nHandkerchief heads talking about the odds\n\nTechnique will force you into strategical retreat\nBecause I dominate guerrilla warfare in the streets\nThere ain't no way to picture me without a victory speech\nWhen I reach higher positions\nWithout the recognition of pissed on competition\nCause I conquered their renditions\nIn a systematic form like a religious tradition\nMy mission is to take you, lyrically break you\nLyrically assassinate you\nLyrically incinerate your body and recreate you\nTo destroy the power that mentally incarcerates you\nCause even though I rip it better I could not forsake you\nYou're my people with the same oppressors so how could I hate you\nThe revolution of the mind that bring me generates you\nBut when you come original people impersonate you, start to hate you\nCause the conflict is building within the ultimate sin\nIs to be ashamed of your skin\nMy rhymes are like Jamaican over proof I make the room spin\nIntoxicated flow I bleed vodka and brandy\nDon't make me choke you down like Jon Ben\u00e9t Ramsey\nSomething demands of me to rip this fucking shit uncannily\nGod commanded me to be a technological disease\nAnd psychologically do battle with the best emcee's\nUpper-case the 'T' in Technique\nCause I'm the capital of revolutionary nation that's infallible\nAztec; Lecter, Hannibal\nRip your heart out of your chest and feed it to the cannibals\nYour just a fucking animal but I'm the Neosapien\nCause my original civilization was based upon creation\nYou know theirs no escaping even though your heart is racing\nI'll put your best disciple on academic probation\nFuck the litigation, fuck the best rapper nominations\nAnd fuck the president I voted for assassination\nI'm saying fuck the federal bullshit investigations\nFuck the cover up of ghetto radiation extermination\nUsing my people for experimentation\nAnd if doesn't play hip hop then fuck your radio station\n\n(Hook)\n\n[Malcolm X]\nRevolutions overturn systems, revolutions destroy systems! (crowd cheers)\n\nYo what the fuck happen to reality spitting rhyme slayers\nThese days everybody trying to be a thug or a player\nWhere did all the real motherfuckers go in the game\nBring back the break dancers and graffiti writers with fame\nI remember hip hop before the mic gun clapping\nCause I used to drink forties with more flavor then these rappers\nLyrical ego trips doesn't make fortification\nYour not dope enough, spit self glorification\nSo don't jerk me around cause my name ain't masturbation\nLife is hard it'll leave you scarred cause I been through shit\nIf you consider rap a job I suggest that you quit\nDon't you understand the audience will listen and dance\nIn the club, crib or car or whatever they get the chance\nTo be emancipated start debating justice in the cipher\nWhy do you think project rooms look like the cells in Rikers\nI'm explaining the significance on the reason behind it\nThey're preparing your children for the prison environment\nWhen you don't amount to shit prison becomes retirement\nBut I refuse to be took in to central booking in chains\nCause sleeping on the floor in cages starts to fuck with your brain\nThe system ain't reformatory, it's only purgatory\nClose to hell but I rebel as begin to spark an L\nAnd tell my people how we fell into the trap that we live in\nBecause they locked us up in ghetto's and began to rape our women\nSo I leave the system Unforgiven like Eastwood\nCause I was bless with lyrical strength to do whatever I could\nYou should of seen it coming long ago when you were very young\nMy word is through the father, holy spirit and his fucking son\nCause when I grab the mic device in front of Christ and start to rip it\nI'll make Jesus turn around and say \"yo pop this nigga flipped it\"\nSo talk about whatever and be what you wanna be\nBut don't mistake the way I break the faith for simple blasphemy\nCause through the highest frequencies in the NYC\nI'm crushing 97.1 percent of MC's\n\n(Hook)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9c9631e16897ed9bc090afd0a05da5ae.1000x974x1.jpg", "album": "Revolutionary Vol. 1", "year": "2001-09-18"}]}
