{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nShe had the sweetest scent I ever smelt a woman have\nSkin would glisten like reflections off the blueish Jag\nShe had a Jewish dad, and a Jamaican maid\nStarted hanging with strippers and dropping the zippers\nAnd selling the pussy for paper to play\nCrusty feet like she hiking for days and live in the mountains\nAt the park she piss in the fountain, shit on the Michigan towel\nShe quick to split up an owl\nShe loves some dick in her bowels\nDabble in crystal, polish the pistol, powder her sniffles with flour\nStraight flieshman\nIn the private part of her pussy pocket\nRandomly pussy farting\nSold at the hookers auction\nLeft as a crooked orphan\nWrapped in the sports section\nBox score, fake black rubber cock in the top drawer, what\n\n[Bridge]\nMake this fucking bitch sit in vinegar\nApple cider baths\nSit in the vinegar\nBronsolino\nPS\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, so many unfamiliar faces that have come and gone\nYou're a constant, fucked you in the school closet\nWe were young then, experimental periods\nLaid a towel cause I fucked you on your period\nStole my mothers car crashed it by the Burger King\nYoung love, but we thought it was eternity\nRaw sex \u2013 never thought about paternity\nBut now this cunt is trying to murder me\nAbusing me physically and verbally\nSaid my dick was too small\nI went and got the surgery, just to show it off\nThis ain't real shit, baby, I'm just going off\nClear the mind, fuck it, so I wrote a song\nNight life, I'm destined for the bright lights\nKnife fights at the bar with some white dykes\nShe hold me down, break a bottle on the bitch head\n.25 out the pussy and it spits lead\nWe always end up in a situation\nShe throwing diapers out the window at me\nCalled the cops said I beat her face\nBeat the case, now I shiver at a sweet embrace\n\n[Riff 1]\nI rap now, bitches sucking like a vacuum\nOn the bed, stay bent like a smack spoon\nBubble butt thicker than the double dutch\nIn the van, leave her tied up in bumblefuck\n\n[Verse 3]\nCold, tired and I mean it\nI thought we'd grow to old farts in Phoenix\nWell now you see me 'lo scarves and a ski knit\nBut I've been here since the beginning, like a prefix\nBut I'mma to do what I gotta do\nTrying to make this french dough like a P\u00e2te \u00e0 Choux\nOver your head, after sex shorty hold me in bed\nSmoking Ethiopian red\nThe son rose, a single teardrop fallopians bled\nNowadays you catch the hooker sniffing coke in the shed\nIt's a damn shame I'm just chilling eating lamb brain\nI keep the weiner on display for the campaign\n\n[Riff 2]\nI'm just doing what I had to do\nTryna Drop me in the ground but I'm not going\nTo the top till I fall just like Owen\nHeartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak\n\n[Outro]", "title": "Thug Love Story 2012", "album": "Blue Chips", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7a3649262f7c86b3e60cd3e672699bb1.400x400x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
