Frizz]\nAy, ay\nI'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid\nAy\n'Bout that life, I ain't ever ran from it\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\n\n[Verse 1: Rittz]\nI've been feeling like Pablo in the Wells Fargo\nI ain't here to talk about a car loan\nPockets on my cargo shorts full of money\nAnd a duffel bag stuffed full, hard to keep the zipper on the top closed\nYou can barely pay a car note\nWhy you mad at me because your credit score low?\nI done gone broke but I bounced back\nLeaning on the counter while she look at my account\nCan I have a lollipop though?\nRunnin' game flirtin', with the bank teller\nI can tell she thinking I'm a cocaine dealer\nI got cash 'cause I rap, I don't trap\nI was hurting when I didn't have money, now the paper like a painkiller\nThe Internet say I'm worth four mil'\nIt used to be a way worse ordeal\nNo more Dollar Menu orders, eating four course meals\nThought I was a winner, look at what the scoreboard said\nForrest Gump in the end zone and kept running\nOn the way to make a milli you can bet on me\nYou sitting still like a crash test dummy\nLike you got a check coming\nTryna flash, you ain't got Tech money\nYou ain't ever live lavish, tryna be Travis\nYou ain't ever built like that\nYou been living in a fantasy knowing that you can't achieve\nI'ma tell you real life fast\nKeep it real like that\nYeah\n\n[Hook: Frizz]\nI'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid\nAy\n'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy, ay\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy\nI'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid\nAy\n'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nGet some big ones, shit comes, quick son ditch 'em\n'Cause they gonna get to begging from the rich one\nFor the money for tummy, booty, and they tits done\nCross yo neck with a razor\nFor the fetty when they see you livin' major\nHow they comin' for money ya job paid ya\nWhen not even one of them did a little bit of labor\nWith them brand new hunnids\nDamn you done it\nNot a way somebody can ever ban you from it\nHow can you stomach\nThe poverty I hit the lottery\nSo when you go in the pile can you plummet\nDamn you stuntin'\nOn the land when you expand the grands\nThey gonna stand who run it and the jam you brung it\nComin' from all the fans the Kansas City man do gun it\nTake all the paper don't let the paper take ya\nBig money maker you're gonna wait to vapor\nFrom all the haters they wanna waste ya\nLike a trip when they hit a gallon of J\u00e4ger\nOff with the money is why they shoot ya\n'Cause they jealous they makin' the shotty juice ya\nI ain't slippin' or givin' nobody boosters\nI keep the brim a hunnid 'cause Tech is a crowded poosta\nNigga, ay\n\n[Hook: Frizz]\nI'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid\nAy\n'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy, ay\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy\nI'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid\nAy\n'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\n\n[Verse 3: JL]\nLike a brand new hunnid dollar bill\nWhen they put the light to me they will know that I'm real\nI'ma get to the money\nBut I give 'em what they can build in it\nRock at the rigorous on the go without a chill\nWe two up, it's too much money to be made\nToo much money for me to ever be a slave\nToo much money for me to not wanna get out of the bed and go get it\nSomebody already gettin' paid\nIt don't matter if you rappin' or thuggin', be stackin' or pluggin'\nIt\u2019s either you are slackin' or pumpin', how bad do you want it?\nLook even if you hover at the oven and you wrapping a couple of 'em\nMoving two by fours like Jim Duggan, you buggin'\nIf you don't got the lucrative hustle\nLooking for loot producing part of productive 'cause you\nGotta be tough and plus you gotta do what you must do\nThrow it when you win, they will son the rustle\nBut I see hawks when I see these thots, and I read thoughts\nLet them wonder \u2018bout the bread\nHe financially flaunts 'cause he know what she wants\nLet alone fucks I give 'em the photo cred\nEven though I do collect the dough, I haven't changed yet\nNever quit, never sit waiting for a paycheck\nTo the paid jet, then get lifted like a weight set\nWith a loud pack, hit a chronic like a Dre set\nJay high that's a safe bet\n\n[Hook: Frizz]\nI'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid\nAy\n'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy, ay\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy\nI'ma keep it real like a brand new hunnid\nAy\n'Bout that life, I ain't never ran from it\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money\nAy\nEverywhere I go I try to get to the money"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
