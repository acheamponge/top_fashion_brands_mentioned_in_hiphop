At Micky D's?\nIt wouldn't work, no way\n\nI'm a big money haver\nBut not the last laugher\nFor me infamy\nMakes me no autographer\n\nCustody haunts my dreams\nNightmares of capture\nParanoid of surveillance\nPhobia of cameras\n\nMy bank's bigger\nBut so are my fears\nPast records prove players\nLive limited years\n\nBut I'm unlike the rest\nKnown to be the best\nFast money, true wealth\nMy eternal quest\n\nI hustle all night long\nThere ain't no gain in rest\n12 gauge close range\nBlood's on my chest\n\nI looked into his face\nI thought he was my friend!\nMy boy had me set up!\nThis wound would never mend\n\nNo matter who you trust\nYou simply cannot win\nIt's always fun in the beginning\nBut it's pain in the end\n\nPain (x4)\n\nGold rope wearer\nNeighborhood terror\nCan't hang around my mother\nCause she says I scare her\n\nGot a light sunburn\nFrom too much pool-side sittin'\nCordless phone keeps me on\nCause there ain't no quittin'\n\nMind's in a money mode\nSeems like it should explode\nGirlies on my jammie--\nGot a female overload\n\nYoung street messiah\nProfessional liar\n19, got a Benz\n21, I'll retire\n\nCrazy money it ain't funny\nSuckers lovin' my jock\nBut there's some people at my door\nThat didn't even knock!\n\nTask force boomin'\nDoggin' my crib out\nCan't shout!\nF.B.I.'s got a gun in my mouth\n\nThrew me on the floor\nCalled my girl a whore\nPulled ten G's out my mattress\nAnd was lookin' for more\n\nCracked my safe with an axe\nThen they laughed to the max!\nWhen they seem my money kickin' it\nIn twenty-G stacks\n\nBooked me on ten counts\nWith bails of different amounts\nThe charges stuck like glue--\nSome that I couldn't pronounce!\n\nThey threw my ass the book\nMy life was surely took\nThen they gave my girl ten years\nFor hangin' out with a crook\n\nShe played the game herself\nFast lane quick wealth\nNo respect for the law\nOr the city's health\n\nThe sweat of hustler's greed\nIs not reserved for men\nIt's always fun in the beginning\nBut it's pain in the end\n\nPain (x5)\n\nYeah, that ain't nothin'!\nCause when I get outta here, I'mma get right back in the money\nCause they don't know that I know what time it is, ya see\nI done learned something. I did half my time, but I can learn more when I was in here\nAnd I'mma go right back out and get paid, you understand what I'm sayin'? Cause I did half my time.
