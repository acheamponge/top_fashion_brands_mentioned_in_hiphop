How you feel?\nAre you fine? I am sorry\n\nI thought you were not like all of them\nEveryone just forgets about me ... No reason\n\nI thought that you were different\nI thought you were not the same\n\nHow are you? How you feel?\nAre you fine? I will stop bothering\n\nI should stop fond of people in that way\nI will stop fond of people so fast\n\nWith you I felt that I was not alone\nWith you I felt with someone\n\nWhere are you? Where are you now?\n\nI hope then you want to talk to me\nI'll wait for you, Okay I'm not so nice\nBut I'll wait for you to want to talk to me", "album": "Living in the dark "}], "artist": "SadBoyTaki"}
