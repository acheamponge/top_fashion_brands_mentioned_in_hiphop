My specs up\nMorph hostile and docile insubordinance your phylum\nChordata asylum swarmes' your coordinates. Rush\nMust not sleep, must warn others\nI\u2019ll tourniquet your turbulence\nThen trample on your stutters\nIf I could displace every vagrant in America\nWith traces of my character\nThe Earth would be a more pitiful habitat\nWith infinite acres of auto-cry intricate nature\nSwung open the nomenclature to obscure warlock trickery.Pure\nHazmat got tossed back by liquors supporting patience\nWorking knuckles for audio duplication\nThat\u2019s like fiending for a purpose\n\n[Looped sample]\n\nAesop Rock, prototype Robocop\nJabberwocky rocking on the highest hilltop\nI possess two siamese styles that\u2019s like connected at the mic hollering monstrous\nPoly-tech impede indidgy progress, deaf\nSwept off your meridian. It\u2019s operation Start With a Slummy Raped Your Milk and Honey\nCan I like, conjure up like all potent components of like\nMiddle siblings scribbling on his lonesome like\nHit him with my ninety-nine metal plated mics upon the wall, take em' down, pass em'round, rock em' all. Bust it\nI\u2019m forever building my City of Lost Children ripping rungs off your ladder at a\nSardonic smirk. Ebonics lurking where the crop circles got stamped out from the rain dance\nTsunami rain blast lift off like origami cranes and sloppy braincasted class-a-piece mastered to capture your flag then flutter\nWhile slaves defy water sucked through from paper bags\nThe magic-maker dragging devils to add triple sixes melt the triple glitches on your console\nI calibrate my mics prior to claimin' shit is rockable\nUnlock and pull a backdoor for the bounce\nWhile cannily panicking was the average. I broadcast modern boredom mesozoic poetry pupils\nCaught up in scruples from the inimical nature of my program\nElegantly overcast password curse an a tactless bastard\nCatatonic until personal practice mastered\n\n[Looped sample]", "title": "Antisocial", "album": "Music for Earthworms", "image": "https://images.genius.com/355a2e1156bc79b1e8d0997024f4cc06.300x302x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
