Coast to coast\nI'm slabbin' candy drops, punchin' clocks and smashin' broads\nI got money like Reggie Bush, my billboard got a lotta yards\nI'm with that Poppa Joe, plus I got dro on the low\nI keep the lean for a month or so\nBut I'm back on it, I can't let go\nI'm down with [?], we switchin' [?]\nSome of these boys ain't lastin', we still right here countin' cash\n\n[Chorus]", "year": "2007-04-03"}]}
