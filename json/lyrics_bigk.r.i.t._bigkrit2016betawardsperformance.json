Fuck yo' feelin's\nWhy you smilin' when I'm so serious?\nI hate patrolling your space, like why you livin'?\nStop asking questions, why you filmin'?\nYou look suspicious, I think you dealin'\nStep out the car, fit the description\nSomeone I fear, I need to kill it\nBlood on the curb, I need it spillin\u2019\n'Nother civilian, 'nother not guilty\n'Nother T-shirt, 'nother rap lyric\n'Nother life gone, I can't forgive it"}], "artist": "Big K.R.I.T."}
