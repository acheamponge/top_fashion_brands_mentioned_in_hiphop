Target]\nToday I've woken up and pray that I would sober up\nFought my way to find this edge, but yet I'm never close enough\nClose the door that I opened up, reachin' out, I know I'm stuck\nThis the only way I'm driven, it's sad enough, this road is tough\nI've lost friends in the past for reasons unknown\nBurnt bridges, and broke down walls with only one stone\nMy mother says I act like my father, maybe I'm bothered\nAt the fact that I know she's right and I am only a coward\nI've been fightin' off this persecution, tryna find a new solution\nVengeance is upon us and I'm here to get my retribution\nI had a dollar in a dream, but I spent it\nAnd now I'm just livin' out my sentence\nLord, please guide be on this road 'cause it's lonely and long\nPlease forgive me, cause I know that I'm wrong\nFor every time that I gave up in the past and you pulled me along\nI'm in debt to you for holdin' this long\nMy mama told me\n\n[Chorus: Hard Target]\nWhen the door gets closed all the lights go out\nJust another shallow grave that we can't climb out\nReminiscin' 'bout a past that we can\u2019t take back\nI know it\u2019s almost over, know it\u2019s almost over\nJust know that I'ma write another chapter for me\n'Cause I can barely fall asleep, it\u2019s like a quarter to three\n'Cause I can\u2019t wait to see the sunrise, comin' for me\n'Cause I know it\u2019s almost over, know it\u2019s almost over (Tonight, tonight, tonight)\n'Cause I know it\u2019s almost over, know it\u2019s almost over (Tonight, tonight, tonight\u2028)\n'Cause I know it\u2019s almost over, know it\u2019s almost over tonight\n\n[Verse 2: Gemstar]\nEven when the door closes there's a reason for the madness\nBridges burnt to ashes, no escapin' your past, kid\nThey say that karma hits you when your down on your luck\nNever had no fear of lightnin', 'til the day you get struck\nI seen the real that kept it real, the fake ones kept it fake\nSo I feel the way I feel and I'ma pray for all these snakes\nAnd connivers that despise us, but we riders, 'til we dyin'\nSo I\u2019m sorry for the problems that I caused you\nMy past haunts me, I feel like my trash wants me to break\nKeep my faith in the higher power they never can shake\nCan\u2019t divide us from this universal law\nYou can see the gifts of all 'em, what it\u2019s used for, what it\u2019s for\nBut I use it for the world, but now I use it for the Lord\nIf we started underground, but now I see that music soar\nNow we taking it to levels that they never seen before\nThank the Lord, every time I reach your door, \u2018fore it close up\n\n[Chorus: Hard Target]\nWhen the door gets closed all the lights go out\nJust another shallow grave that we can't climb out\nReminiscin' 'bout a past that we can\u2019t take back\nI know it\u2019s almost over, know it\u2019s almost over\nJust know that I'ma write another chapter for me\n'Cause I can barely fall asleep, it\u2019s like a quarter to three\n'Cause I can\u2019t wait to see the sunrise, comin' for me\n'Cause I know it\u2019s almost over, know it\u2019s almost over (Tonight, tonight, tonight)\n'Cause I know it\u2019s almost over, know it\u2019s almost over (Tonight, tonight, tonight\u2028)\n'Cause I know it\u2019s almost over, know it\u2019s almost over tonight\n\n[Verse 3: Moccasin Creek]\nThey say when one door closes, another opens fast\nI\u2019m holdin' black roses, standin' at another mass\nI\u2019m askin' Father, \"Tell me why\u2019d you give me all these chances?\"\nThe music kills my pain, my heart forever dances\nI see the open door, with light shinin' 'round the edges\nProfusely sweating, eyes closed, knowing life is precious\nSo why the hell am I still digging out this black hole?\nAnd why the hell am I still feeling like a lost soul?\nMy granny told me long ago, around '89\nLife is like a camera, capture the good times\nDevelop from the negatives, and everything will be fine\nBut time is passin', light traffic, with no slow me downs\nAnd I ain\u2019t laughing, 'cause it\u2019s tragic when they lay us down\nIt\u2019s almost over, sit and watch while the walls crashin'\nLookin' for that open door, full of hope and passion\nIf I lose it in the fire, you can find it in the ashes\n\n[Chorus: Hard Target]\nWhen the door gets closed all the lights go out\nJust another shallow grave that we can't climb out\nReminiscin' 'bout a past that we can\u2019t take back\nI know it\u2019s almost over, know it\u2019s almost over\nJust know that I'ma write another chapter for me\n'Cause I can barely fall asleep, it\u2019s like a quarter to three\n'Cause I can\u2019t wait to see the sunrise, comin' for me\n'Cause I know it\u2019s almost over, know it\u2019s almost over (Tonight, tonight, tonight)\n'Cause I know it\u2019s almost over, know it\u2019s almost over (Tonight, tonight, tonight\u2028)\n'Cause I know it\u2019s almost over, know it\u2019s almost over tonight"}], "artist": "Hard Target"}
