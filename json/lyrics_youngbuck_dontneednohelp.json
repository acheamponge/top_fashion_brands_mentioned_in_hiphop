Y'all was the one that pulled it\nThat's why we represent them niggas like Larry Davis\nBefore he let you cowards kill him he just aimed and sprayed it\nNow what'chu wan' do? Bitch I got a gun too\nWe gon' keep on sendin shots, every time y'all come through\nGot the nerve, tell a nigga put his hands up\nThen beat him to the ground, when you put the boy in handcuffs\n\n[Hook: Young Buck]\nFuck fuck the police, we handle it ourself\nEven if I bleed to death - nigga we don't need no motherfuckin help\nAnd to the right (what) to the left (what)\nLet 'em know (what) we don't need no motherfuckin help\nFuck the police (woop woop) fuck the law (woop woop)\nFuck the police (woop woop) fuck 'em all - we don't need no motherfuckin help\nFuck the police (woop woop) fuck the law (woop woop)\nFuck the police (woop woop) fuck 'em all - we don't need no motherfuckin help\n\n[Young Buck]\nWe used to play, cops and robbers as a little kid\nWhoever was the pigs, we would go and split his wig (ha ha!)\nThen as the years passed, niggas only got worse\nJumped into the gang shit, gotta protect our turf\nWe had enough of gettin handcuffed and pulled over\nWe started tryin, knocked they heads off they fuckin shoulders\nNow where my soldiers at, get ready for combat\nI'm livin like them niggas that done went to Vietnam {?}\nSo if you try to lock me up for smokin my weed\nThe whole force of police, is what they gon' need\nOne of a kind, I'm the last of a dyin breed\nEven the one that was befo' me, he was sayin\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Young Buck]\nWhen I'm New York I'm hollerin nigga we don't need no motherfuckin help\nYeah; when I'm in Tennessee I'm hollerin we don't need no motherfuckin help\nYeahhh, when I'm out in L.A. nigga we don't need no motherfuckin help\nYeahh, A-T-L all day, nigga we don't need no motherfuckin help", "album": "Greatest Hits, Vol. 1", "year": "2005-11-08", "image": "https://images.genius.com/312964ccc0d0d604db10044f85c36fb0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young Buck"}
