Guess who's the lifer\nTo Laudi prom, robbin' the ciphers\nDon't mess with Sun God, he's a fighter\nIt was, '80's, Michael Jackson and leather jackets\nBicycle fashion, my last words of a king when he's rapping\nSwing flurries like a champ when he scrapping\nGrew up fad, notepad, that's all I had\nIt's the only thing that bring me back to past\n\n[Chorus 2X]\n\n[Killah Priest]\nIt's the Priest, bless like sheeps in white sheets\nClothes fit me like robes, right to the T\nPearls huggin', back up, me and wifey\nIt's so elegant, my words add flesh to skeletons\nOnce it's heard, it covers the flesh from element\nIt's the medicine, take it for the soul\nIt's better than gold, Proverbs, makes your pops burst\nStarbust, above God's Earth\nAnd the moonlight, I move like a Greek move degrees at night\nI write movies that masterpiece, the cornerstones my poem\nI lay bricks like a mason, my words can move a nation\nThrow pens out the page, the same way you pull a pen out a grenade\nAnd watch it explode, yo, my mind explode, divine and glow\nBack to the days, where the rhymes was made\n\n[Chorus 4X]\n\n[Outro: Killah Priest]\n*singing along to the beat*\nYo, come on, let me hear ya'll sing it, it go\n*singing along to the beat*\nHeat it up, uh, Black August, take control, understand\nWords of the Proverbs, heard... yeah.. uh\nPriesthood, where you at, boy? Yeah..\nJoe.."}]}
