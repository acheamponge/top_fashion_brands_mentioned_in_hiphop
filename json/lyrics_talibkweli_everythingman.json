Yeah, ay, they ain't know what that sound like\n\nFeel the heartbeat, feel the heartbeat\nOn your eardrum, we got a new heartbeat\nFeel the heartbeat, feel the heartbeat\nOn your eardrum, we got a new heartbeat\n\nYo, what becomes of a dream deferred\nThat never makes it to the world to be seen or heard\nDo it breathe, do it got a heartbeat, is it alive\nDo it leave, only to become a star in the sky\nI believe, no scratch that I know, this ain't my full potential\nOnly usin' 10 percent of my mental on instrumentals\nBut incidentally my, energy heavenly\nCan he be so ill there ain't no, pill or no remedy\nThe, maker of memories posess the recipe to your fate\nMake no mistake there ain't no escapin your destiny\nEspecially when, 'til death do us part, like wedding rings\nI'll be here forever, put that on e'rything\n\n[Singers - repeat 2X]\nYour everything man\n\n[Talib Kweli]\nYour Alpha and your Omega, your beginning and your end\nYour father, your brother, your lover your friend\nThe blood in your vein that gets spilled and, runs in the drain\nThat's right my flow one and the same, the joy and the pain\nMy name, the burner that destroy the toy and the train\nAll city all night I'm enjoyin the fame\nI'm a hustler, I'm a gangster and a rebel with the rank of a general\nIn the battle between God or the Devil\nI lay claim to your spirit, your religion, your belief system\nI\u2019ll do your hittin, your catching and you\u2019re relief pitchin\nThis kid proficient in, every position\nThe man of your dreams and your nightmares commandin your vision\n'Til it's quite clear like light beer, yeah I'm standin right here\nI get you hot but stay cooler than the night air\nI try to fit it in the same rhyme\nBut realize, I can't be everything to everyone at the same time\n\n[Singers - repeat 2X]\nYour everything man\n\n[Outro]\nFirst time I heard him, I was in Japan\nSeems like the first time I heard him was like, the Reflection, Reflection Eternal\nLike when Kanye came out I guess was when I started to listen, I hate to say that but\nNew York native, and serious Talib fan\nI came all the way from Puerto Rico just to see Talib Kweli\nHim, Mos Def all of them man, I need them out here in my life\nIt's a rainy morning in New York City"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
