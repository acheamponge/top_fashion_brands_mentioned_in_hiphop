Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy\nI'm in London, got my beat from London\n\n[Chorus]\nEvery time I like a bih, I find out she a gnat\nSomebody call the vet, my dog turned out to be a rat\nI'm a slick pimp, got a sixth sense\nHo, you ain't a dime, you just six cents\nI be on them beans, she be on codeine\nAll I want is money, all she want is me\nShe just wanna be loved, she just wanna be pleased\nAll I want is money, all she want is me\n(All I want is money, all she want is me)\n(All I want is money, all she want is me)\n\n[Verse 1]\nSay I'm so selfish, all I think about is fetty\nI can't settle down, somethin' just won't let me\nI want to settle down, well maybe I ain't ready\nBae, I'm livin' reckless, and I'm thuggin' heavy\nIn love with the skreets, and I'm in too deep\nI be tryna leave, it keep control of me\nIt got my heart, got my mind, it got my physique\nShe wanna wake up with my wand and put that ass to sleep\nI don't bleed Kool-Aid, baby, I bleed concrete\nI ask God to give me wisdom, help me spot a leech\nI be talkin' money, tell that ho; \"kapeesh\"\nTell that ho to sheesh, love is for the weak\n\n[Chorus]\nEvery time I like a bih, I find out she a gnat\nSomebody call the vet, my dog turned out to be a rat\nI'm a slick pimp, got a sixth sense\nHo, you ain't a dime, you just six cents\nI be on them beans, she be on codeine\nAll I want is money, all she want is me\nShe just wanna be loved, she just wanna be please\nAll I want is money, all she want is me\n(All I want is money, all she want is me)\n(All I want is money, all she want is me)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm ziggied up, 26, 13, 6\nI'm a seven figure nigga, remember when I had six\nI'm a seven figure nigga, remember I ain't have shit\nEven though I'm rich, can't forget that I was hittin' licks\nAll I want is that, all she want is this\nI just wanna hit, but I just wanna hit\nWhat be on your mind when it come to this?\nWhy you close your eyes every time we kiss?\nI'ma keep it pimpin', I'ma keep on livin'\nAnd keep on catchin' flights\nAnd never catchin' feelin's\nI'ma keep it simple, I'ma keep poppin' flo-rhythm\nI like when I'm with ya\nBut I love gettin' scrilla\n\n[Chorus]\nEvery time I like a bih, I find out she a gnat\nSomebody call the vet, my dog turned out to be a rat\nI'm a slick pimp, got a sixth sense\nHo, you ain't a dime, you just six cents\nI be on them beans, she be on codeine\nAll I want is money, all she want is me\nShe just wanna be loved, she just wanna be please\nAll I want is money, all she want is me\n(All I want is money, all she want is me)\n(All I want is money, all she want is me)"}]}
