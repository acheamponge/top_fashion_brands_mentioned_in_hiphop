Why did you do that?\nLove? Don\u2019t make me laugh\n\n[Verse 1]\nYeah Yeah\nWith bitter beer and I\nCigarettes that I quit because of you\nBecause of you I smoke them again\nGoes out to you\nTo you who left without one word\nCan you hear this song right now\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis lonely morning I meet without you\nAfter you left, the compass of the map in my heart\nHas lost its way\nMy life is all ruined\nI was unprepared\nYou ran far away from me\nMy Venus\nI\u2019ve prayed to God to try to hate you\nBecause it was so unfair\nBecause my life felt so miserable\nMy tone, actions, even my steps have gone away\nMy habits that have copied yours\nAre bothering me\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou can\u2019t be forgotten, how can I forget you\nYou\u2019re on the first page\nOf all of my memories\nBirthdays, the beach, over the cliff of deep love\nYou\u2019re the first girl who\u2019s given me the pain\nOf a first broken heart\n\n[Verse 4]\nEven if in my craziness I feel sad I\u2019ll try to smile\nI don\u2019t want your empty feelings, we just too late\nUh if it\u2019s your\u2019s, if you\u2019re going to do whatever you want\nThis is the way you love?\nIf I hadn\u2019t started the beginning yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe time I had with you was so hard\nEveryday I waited for you\nBy my phone\nAnd every time you have no blame\nYou told me you were sorry\nAnd avoided me then left\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I love you girl\nI wish you would stay here\nBut I love you girl\nI wish you would hold onto me\nBut I love you girl\nEven if I don\u2019t say it\nPlease don\u2019t lose my eager heart\nMa girl\n\n[Verse 5]\nIn my eyes you are just beautiful\nMy friend told me not to fall too deeply\nFirst I get mad that girl is different\nShe is nicer and more pure than anybody\n\n[Verse 6]\nI lo-\u2026 no, I really like you\nLet\u2019s not change I\u2019ll make you happy, you\nStay by my side time flows by\nWhen 1, 2 years goes by\nMore better than this year\n\n[Verse 7]\nYour voice seems so tired\nYou need a place to lean, please lean on me\nDon\u2019t you see me? Why do you fall alone?\nLower my head, my heart tears and breaks\n\n[Verse 8]\nIt was great when we first met\nWe were happy just seeing each other\nActually I\u2019m still like that\nBut why aren\u2019t you?\nLately when I see you\nI don\u2019t get the same feelings yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe memories with you were so hard\nOf course it may be my fault\nI\u2019ll probably comfort myself like this\nWhen time goes by this memory will be like smoke too\nFly far away, a new love may find me too\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I love you girl\nI want to make you smile\nBut I love you girl\nI want to wipe away your tears\nBut I love you girl\nNothing anymore\nI can\u2019t turn back your changed heart\nI know girl\n\n[Verse 9]\nI call wanting to see your face\nOne last time\nBut till the end there\u2019s no answer from you\nOh why are you avoiding me?\nPlease tell me girl\nI\u2019m still standing still\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I love you girl\nI wish you would stay here\nBut I love you girl\nI wish you would hold onto me\nBut I love you girl\nEven if I don\u2019t say it\nPlease don\u2019t lose my eager heart\n\n[Outro]\nBut I love you girl\nI want to make you smile\nBut I love you girl\nI wan to wipe away your tears\nBut I love you girl\nNothing anymore\nI can\u2019t turn back your changed heart\nI know girl"}]}
