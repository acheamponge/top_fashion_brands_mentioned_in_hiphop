You one hit wonder\nHalloween mascot, wore your costume early\nI seen you in your video with all your costume jewelry\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't come back to New York with that B.S. dawg\nNiggas is lookin' for you like the PS4\nHow you gon' even try to come up out of your talk?\nWith your hairdo lookin' like Bill de Blasio's son\nIf you a real rude boy, why you don't talk like it?\nIf you from Atlanta, why you don't tote the hawk like it?\nSweetest in Atlanta, peach, you ain't Atlanta brave\nYou closer to a falcon, a bird out of its cage\nLove hip hop, like Peter Gunz, Joe Budden, Saigon\nPapoose, my flow is deep enough to drown a lifeguard\nWould give you some more bars, but you ain't even worthy\nHappy Thanksgiving, you jive ass turkey\n\n[Hook]", "year": null}]}
