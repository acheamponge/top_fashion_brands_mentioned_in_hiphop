Yes, there is\nAll my strengths are to be by your side, to be happy, to be well\n\nEverything I write to you, everything I do for you, do you appreciate it?\nI'm not saying do not do it, I'm just asking\n\nI hope you're fine, I do not know how I'm doing\nYou know that I love you, you know that I protect you\n\nMy heart is easy to break, only you know how to take care of it\nI would like to remind you every day that I love you, but I can not do it\n\nMy lips are loose, my spirits are only for you, My eyes cry for you\nIs there any way to make the beautiful family we want? Yes, there is\nAll my strengths are to be by your side, to be happy, to be well\n\nEverything I write to you, everything I do for you, do you appreciate it?\nI'm not saying do not do it, I'm just asking\n\nLet's run alone, run together, I love you, I appreciate you, I respect you, I take care of you, I miss you, I give you my happiness\n\nBye take care", "album": "Lover"}], "artist": "SadBoyTaki"}
