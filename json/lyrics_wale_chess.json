Except in this chess, the board is made of water that's just flowing, and all the chess pieces are spoken. You can make all the moves you want, they will not affect the outcome\n\n[Verse 1]\nIn the grand scheme of life we like pieces on the board\nLook inside yours, you a king, or a pawn?\nI came from a scene where the kids on water\nGod forbid they see five, get your things, hit the border\nLike a sicilian defense\nGo ahead and play silly, you'll get billy clubbed to death\nWelcome to the city, ain't no sympathy for rats\nWhere the whites move first and you go second, cause you're black\nWas it Rayful, was it Reagan, did the 80's hold 'em back?\nThis is no connect four but blood spilling for connects\nYears later niggas still up in that trap\nThank God that a nigga had that rap\nCause after school, played that corner like a rook\nThat's when niggas getting book, out there tryna get their last move\nHe gon' need that check mate\nAnd every night they take L's straight to the face\nLet's play\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn the grand scheme of life we like pieces on the board\nLook inside yours, you a king, or a pawn?\nNow for that juice, would you bishop, double cross?\nSee they move so many squares,  Damier falling off\nThey was getting bread, getting on\nStupid nigga cutting grass while my payers moving lawns\nNow move along, pawns never get the Queens\nI'm the only nigga here like Ron Simmons in the ring\nNow I'm winning in the streets\nRaf Simons shit, that's free\nBob Marley, Bob Dylan, Bob Fisher on that beat\nGenius, me, fresh no Esteban\nBest be on your toes, you trying to avoid the blitz\nWe up", "album": "Festivus", "image": "https://images.genius.com/988a0210cfb98b5e09ff91b6b9760a0a.514x514x1.jpg"}]}
