I wish I, I wish I didn't.\nBut you'd like to get rid of them all together, wouldn't you?\nUh, it would be a good idea, yeah.\n\n[Chorus:]\nWhen I\u2019m alone, I check the time\nI hit you up, you\u2019re on my mind\nYou love the light, the fast life\nFuck that though\nI\u2019d rather go slo\n\n[Verse 1:]\nUsed to be happy, but now shit's unpredictable\nI smiled at the show but there were tears in the limo though\nYou fucked her on my birthday and that\u2019s what really hurt the most\nYou tell the truth\u2026 half way, guess thats why this unfixable\nBut still \u2026\n\n[Chorus:]\nWhen I\u2019m alone, I check the time\nI hit you up, you\u2019re on my mind\nYou love the light, the fast life\nFuck that though\nI\u2019d rather go slo, yeah\nI\u2019d rather go slo\nI\u2019d rather go slo\nI\u2019d rather go slo\n\n[Verse 2:]\nWhen I call sometimes I wish you pick up\nBut most days the call is declined\nIt\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t give a fuck\nYou outta sight, so you outta mind\nI'm doing alright know I\u2019ma be fine\nI gotta few candidates standing in line\nBroke up before but I wasn\u2019t like this\nNot many regrets I wish I could rewind\nDamn! We both got our lives so it's no surprise\nThe schedules conflict and we can\u2019t coincide\nMy heart's cold, feels like I got no insides\nWe rushed it to the finish line, we should have took our time\nYou make me crazy with rash decisions and sudden movements\nCan\u2019t even enjoy a moment or pay attention to it\nIf I could try this shit again? Real shit I'd probably do it\u2026\nThat's why it's hard to act like you someone I'm really through with\n\n[Chorus:]\nWhen I\u2019m alone, I check the time\nI hit you up, you\u2019re on my mind\nYou love the light, the fast life\nFuck that though\nI\u2019d rather go slo, yeah\nI\u2019d rather go slo\nI\u2019d rather go slo\nI\u2019d rather go slo\nWhen I\u2019m alone, I check the time\nI hit you up, you\u2019re on my mind\nYou love the light, the fast life\nFuck that though\nI\u2019d rather go slo, yeah\nI\u2019d rather go slo\nI\u2019d rather go slo\nI\u2019d rather go slo", "image": "https://images.genius.com/122cb5a8d88b89ac2c08aedadb152d20.1000x1000x1.png", "album": "TrapGold", "year": "2012-10-11"}]}
