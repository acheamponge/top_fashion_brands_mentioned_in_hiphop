Is the life of the mind no longer valid?\nIf we don't live what we think through daily habits\nI'm embarrassed to say, everyday I betray\nHow I think I'd like to live in this world, am I insane?\nOr the same as the hypocrites that I do disdain\nWhat would I do in their shoes? I know what I'd like to claim\nBut there's no way we could say, how we would behave\nIf we had a whole different life up to this day\nIs it innate? Encoded in our DNA?\nOr in the spirit that is born in this body that we enslave\nWhat is happiness for you might be hell for me\nDo you still get to pursue it to the fullest degree?\nWe'll see", "year": "2014-12-15", "album": "Sixteen 16's", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d63d64df777a3ef536fe94251e324962.1000x563x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
