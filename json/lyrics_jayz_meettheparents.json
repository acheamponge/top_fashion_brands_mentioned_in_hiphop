He who hesitates is lost\nHe can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank\nThe old man didn't think he just followed his instinct\nSix shots into his kin, out of the gun\nNiggas be a father, you're killin' your son\nSix shots into his kin out of the gun\nNiggas, be a father, you killin' your sons\n\n[Outro]\nMeet the parents...", "title": "Meet the Parents", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bbaaa25ac55d3bc2008448e1647d3b54.720x631x1.jpg", "year": "2002-11-12", "album": "The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
