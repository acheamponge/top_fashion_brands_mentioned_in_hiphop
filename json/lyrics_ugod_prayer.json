Does anyone care?\nThis is my testament, my bedtime prayer\nI resent my sins, oh Lord, listen clear\nI can feel it in the heat of the night, and in the air\nLord, give me your ear, I want you, to understand\nPlease forgive me, I'm a righteous man\nTryin' to do the best I can, just to feed my fam\nI might die, in these streets, by some jealous hands\nNow I can it's some scam, from the root to the fruit\nCuz when they see me in the streets, grimey's guns salute\nMe, it's the moment of truth, I got mud on my boots\nPlus the sounds of the sirens, cops in hot pursuit\nPray for me..\n\n[Chorus 2X: Autumn Rue]\nAs I lay thee down to sleep\nI pray the Lord, the soul to keep\nIf I die, before I wake\nI pray the Lord, the soul to take\n\n[U-God]\nAll this pressure, building up in the pot\nWhen the schemes released, I'm bout to blow my top\nI'm the cream of the crop, when machine guns pop\nI seen the death angel come when I see son drop\nI cried, tattoo tear drops, cuz inside it hurt\nI saw his life flash before him, as he lied in the dirt\nAnd searched for heaven on earth, in his debts, sold in land\nI poisoned my own community, with kilos and grams\nAnd people don't take a stand, politics tempers flare\nThey build, prisons 'stead of parks, children end up in there\nIt's the welfare, the precinct, the daycare's, indecent\nThe churches, the priest, inside the belly of the beast\nIt's, diseases, crack babies, people actin' crazy\nOh Lord, can you save me? If not, snatch up my baby\nOhhh..\n\n[Chorus 2X]", "title": "Prayer", "year": null, "album": null}], "artist": "U-God"}
