T-Pain\nYeah\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain & (Travie McCoy)]\nHello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (How you\u2005doing?)\nYou\u2005are forever stuck\u2005to me\nHello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (How\u2005you doing?)\nYou are forever stuck to me\n\n[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]\nRemember when rocking with tattoo's wasn't so cool?\nI used to spend my time planning out my sleeves in school\nMind you, this was back in the early 90's\nAt the local tattoo shop was where you can find me\nNow I was like everybody in they mama's covert\nLike here's a bag of tattoos, just add water\nThen she walked in painted from head to feet\nI said, \"That's the type of girl that I have to meet\"\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain & (Travie McCoy)]\nHello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)\nYou are forever stuck to me\nHello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)\nYou are forever stuck to me\n\n[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]\nShe played tough, but I could tell she was feeling the kid\nBut deep down, she didn't even know she was killing the kid\nI was only fifteen she was that times two\nShe had full color black and gray, fine line too\nWhere the portrait of Bettie Page on her right shoulder\nI said, \"Damn, I can't wait until I get older\"\nBut for now, I guess I'll just sit and observe\nAnd hope I pray that one day, I might build up the nerve\nAnd say...\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain & (Travie McCoy)]\nHello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)\nYou are forever stuck to me\nHello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)\nYou are forever stuck to me\n\n[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]\nAlright now, let's fast forward a couple of years\nWe going hard, working on my tattoo career\nOne day I looked up half way though a piece (Forever)\nAnd it was Ms. Tattoo girl staring at me\nShe said, \"Hey, I remember you from back in the day\"\nI said, \"Yeah, the chubby kid without a word to say\"\nShe said, \"Damn, you grew up, man, time sure flying\nYou can hurry up on her 'cause I'm your next client\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain & (Travie McCoy)]\nHello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)\nYou are forever stuck to me\nHello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)\nYou are forever stuck to me\nHello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)\nYou are forever stuck to me\nHello! Ms. Tattoo Girl (Hello, hello)\nYou are forever stuck to me\nYou are forever stuck to me\nYou are forever stuck to me"}], "artist": "Travie McCoy"}
