{"songs": [{"lyrics": "Yeah! And you don't stop\nNow, once again Ace One is on the wax\nAnd this one goes out to everybody\nWho experienced in their lifetime\nOr going to experience in their lifetime some type of hardship\nBecause everybody goes through hardships\n\nSee hardship belongs to me\nI will never give it away or sell it for a fee\nI regret to inform you I will never set it free\nEveryday I'm reminded of how hard it could be\nI take my pain just like a G\nGot my struggle of life down to a T\nIt's nobody's fault but mine if I can't see\nSo I open my eyes and start looking for the key\nHardship is mine to hold onto\nAll through to the Yellow Brick Road it goes\nMy shoulders got the heaviest load but I pack light\nAnd I compensate I got act right when I conversate\nSee some people relate but they don't understand the words\nSome people can climb mountains but can't jump curbs\nAnd vice verse. I know it's such a nice verse\nBut hardship makes everything worse\nAnd worse is a reminder to stay on the path\nBut hardship is mine to have\nBecause hardship keeps me in check\nMainly so I can check myself I give up full respect\nBecause he's real like a hundred-dollar bill\nWithout hardship you wouldn't appreciate your meals\nWithout hardship I wouldn't appreciate my skills\nAnd so I do and so I grew and so I knew\nThat hardship not only makes most of my days blue\nBut it teaches me how to struggle in the jungle\nAnd never crumble and how to remain humble\nSome people they live life inside a glass case\nSome people they live life in the vastness of space\nAnd others will live long at a snail's pace\nI live with hardship slapping me in the face\n\nBecause hardship belongs to me\nI will never give it away or sell it for a fee\nI regret to inform you I will never set it free\nEveryday I'm reminded of how hard it could be\n\nHow hard it could be...\nHow hard it could be...\nEveryday I'm reminded of how hard it could be", "title": "Hardship", "album": "Accepted Eclectic", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f38e699f6f80a3255420adf5e98a0a8.600x600x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
