Nope\nShe seen it in my eyes\nA brand new vision of a brand new ride\n\n[Hook 2x]\nNew ride (new ride), New ride (new ride)\nThat won't fake, steal, or lie\nNew ride (new ride), New ride (new ride)\nAnd out relationship is classified\n\nCheck it...\nTo my tiga grand wizard\nIts me\nWhat (what)\nCheck it"}]}
