Arm & Hammer time\n\n[Hook]\nYou're jelly of my British teeth\nI'm a vicious beast\nIf you do not like my music\nThen it's obvious that you are just too jelly of my British teeth\nI'm a vicious beast, I'm a vicious beast\nI'm a vicious beast, I'm a vicious beast with British teeth\n\n[Verse 2]\nFresh got them whitened, I might get them straightened\nBut I kind of like to frighten the states with them\nAnd would Amy Winehouse\nHave sounded the same without the wide mouth?\nAnd the same applies to Shane MacGowan\nJohn Lydon, Clint Howard\nThink \"Lemmy meets Steve Buscemi\"\nI can already see your semi\nSee you're jelly of my British teeth aplenty\nSee your envy\nI'm the MVP of dentistry on the NHS\nMy teeth are sexy\nI bring the Aquafreshest raps\nGrinning like a Cheshire Cat\nFuck your feckless standards of beauty\nYou can shut your precious mash\nMy dentist was the gentlest\nShe never did a thing that was senseless\nShe sensibly selected medical consensus over aesthetic pretenses\nRegarding hygiene my teeth are quite clean\nBut far from the whitest I've seen\nThey used to be white, now they're yellowing\nMaturing like Cheddar and mellowing\nDeveloping into better things\nThey're getting ever more menacing\nSnapping like a terrapin\nWhen I'm dead, I'll be outlived by my skeleton\n\n[Hook]\nYou're just jelly of my British teeth\nI'm a vicious beast\nIf you do not like my music\nThen it's obvious that you are just too jelly of my British teeth\nI'm a vicious beast, I'm a vicious beast\nI'm a vicious beast, I'm a vicious beast with British teeth", "year": "2017-01-13"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
