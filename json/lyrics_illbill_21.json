(What?!) huh!?\nKitty turn around (What?) turn around\nMister please put the gun down\n(gunshot)\nNow the next time that a plane goes down\nYou better be on it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/99ff63951f21bd5532d81bd64d3cbd69.800x800x1.jpg", "album": "ILL Bill Is The Future Vol. II", "year": "2006-10-13"}]}
