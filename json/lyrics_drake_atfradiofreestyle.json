You confused homie, that's a pensive look there\nWhere those are dark oak floors and that expensive cookwear\nThats a 07 but I got a even newer ride\nDoors all suicide\nI should be your tour guide\nIm expedia flown\nWikepidia known\nObtain a key to your home\nAnd take a seat on your throne\nI been through it all\nSpend it all to do it all\nYou are not me man I could never be you at all\nCause you just stupid dog\nThe A8 super large\nAnd yea you got a range but that shit ain't even supercharged\n\nAight check, flow switch, Flow switch\n\nI don't ever pay a percentage of the retail\nOnly thing Im paying is attention to the detail\nSchedule can change at the mention of a email\nBooking up a show with some tension with a female\nMy Dad said to get rich you have to dig deep\nCause Drake these some big streets\nAnd you are not Big Meech\nAnd you are not Rayful\nAnd this is not DC\nFour years later quarter million off of TV\nYou was having hoop dreams\nI was drafting group schemes\nTake us off of bus kids and turn us into coupe teams\nWell woop there it is\nOops now my troops clean\nFirst car Audi drop, Color like a poutine\nIm feelin grown up, Don't ask me for id, like you know who I be, bouncer I know the owner\nI never go, I felt out of place at a school dance\nCause they know the layout of the mall like I knew france\nInside and out, Therefore I been Hiding out\nAnd you drive cars that I been riding out\nCorrection I been rode em out\nBeen showin' out, sold off shit the stories you've been told about\nAnd dog, I been old amount\nYoung money old accounts\nDegrassi my royalties\nHomie you just owed an once\nNo weight move\nMy shoulder counts\nMan, I don't even know my name anymore man (laughs)"}]}
