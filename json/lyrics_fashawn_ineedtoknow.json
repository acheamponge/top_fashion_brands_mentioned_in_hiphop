I need to know\nWould I be forgotten or would you hold me down?\nSorry but I gotta ask, I need to know\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn life, gotta stay on your toes\nStay tight with the fam, keep an eye on your foes\nWe live in a cold world, it's hard to trust a soul\nSo I stay on the low, sucka free how I roll\nAllergic to these hoes, keep my dick in my jeans\nAway from them gold diggers, gotta stick with my queens\nMight think it's gold just because how I gleam\nBut it's just an illusion, yeah, a bunch of confusion\nIt's hard to be humble when your stomach is growling\nWhile you juggling mountains and you just wanna drop\nThen you reach deep inside and you grab that intuition\nAll them late nights wishing and hoping the pain stop but\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nDeath is only a part of life, I don't know why you scared\nShit you better get prepared for the reaper\nI'd rather know he coming to get me before he creep up\nGo out with a bang take my last hit of reefer\nKiss my momma on the cheek, tell my niggas\n\"I'll see ya up in Heaven, hold it down 'til we meet up\"\nAgain, I'll be somewhere in the clouds with my feet up\nGoing bar for bar with Pac, laughing with Jesus\nAway from the struggling, the drama and the grieving\nAt last I can finally be at peace\nFar away from them heaters who try to bring me down\nAll the trial and tribulations of the streets, I'm finally free\n\n[Hook]", "title": "I Need To Know"}]}
