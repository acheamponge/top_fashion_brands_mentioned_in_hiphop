And my heart is clear\nIntentions, they can be seen\nBut sometimes fiction, it can seem deep\nAnd sometimes reality can be dream\nAnd I see Tetris, everything falls in place\nAnd now they call me the electric eclectic\nAnd I done seen them fall from grace\nLike Quidditch and Hexus\nAnd y'all might have next, but I got present\nAnd I'm the future, now that's presence\nAnd I'm gifted, I'm like presents\nAnd I'm blessed with it, so God presents\nTo you, the one and the only\nI can't lose, so I win, but I'm lonely\nKim Jong couldn't feel this [?]\nI wasn't born with the world, this owe me\nNobody owe me shit\nYou say I ain't great? Dog, are you sick?\nOn every single track, I put a hundred percent\nWait...\n(I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace)\n\n[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]\nI feel like these arms, none of these arms\nNone of these arms can hold me\nI feel like I'm Ace, numero one, one\nOne and only\nI feel like these arms, none of these arms\nNone of these arms can hold me\nI feel like I'm Ace, numero one, one\nOne and only\n\n[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]\nOnly one can win, only one can win\nInstead of out, I\u2019m flunking in\nTo music, [?] sunken in\nUsing crack music, abusing it\nNo more Dr. Seuss in it, balancing act\nJuggling life, love, math, and rap\nWack, I\u2019ll be damned if my life\u2019s in vain\nDog, I\u2019d rather put a knife to veins\nHypothetically, I used to say I want to be the best\nNow I want to be the best\nAnd being better than the rest\nFilled with the Cleveland steamers, I had to get some shit up off my chest\nI\u2019m a Treble clef, tell these boys rest with all that, you sound like ish\nWho sound like this\nComposing to sample a song\nBut give him a Yamaha and he could do it on his own\nThis ain\u2019t a game, but I do it in a zone\nGod sunkissed, so I can\u2019t be crushed\nThis must be genius, I can\u2019t be rushed\nToo legit to quit, I can\u2019t be touched\nI can\u2019t be touched, but I hope y\u2019all feel me\nEven in death, y\u2019all niggas couldn\u2019t kill me\nDon\u2019t ask me how, I\u2019ll just say\nI'm just grace, one, uno, Ace\n\n[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]\nI feel like these arms, none of these arms\nNone of these arms can hold me\nI feel like I'm Ace, numero one, one\nOne and only\nI feel like these arms, none of these arms\nNone of these arms can hold me\nI feel like I'm Ace, numero one, one\nOne and only\nI feel like these arms, none of these arms (I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace)\nNone of these arms can hold me\nI feel like I'm Ace, numero one, one (I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace)\nOne and only\nI feel like these arms, none of these arms (I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace)\nNone of these arms can hold me (I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace)\nI feel like I'm Ace, numero one, one (I'm just grace, one, uno, Ace)\nOne and only\n\n[Outro]\nI'm just grace, one, uno, Ace\nI'm just grace, one, uno, Ace\nI'm just grace, one, uno, Ace\nI'm just grace, one, uno, Ace\nI'm just grace, one, uno, Ace\nI'm just grace, one, uno, Ace\nI'm just grace, one, uno, Ace\nI'm just grace, one, uno, Ace\nI'm just grace, one, uno, Ace", "year": "2009-02-23", "album": "Volume: Two!
