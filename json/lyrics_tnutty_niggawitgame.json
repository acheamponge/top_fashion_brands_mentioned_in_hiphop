And it dont stop, Im a nigga that'll mac lemmie hit it from tha bacc disattachin tha bone. Off in tha wind cuz it costs when I spend time I need to get mine takin blunts to tha dome. Don't feel bad If I leave u alone cuz sticcin and movin is apart of tha game, the reason why Im all in tha bacc of your brain is cuz my diccs in you and wit accurate aim.

You's a mouth but Im not mad cuz Im glad that u like to taste cheeze, I was laced up by my momma my grandmammas and my aunties. 18 wit a attitude, actin like a grown baby girl is u crazy thinkin u can play wit me cuz u freak and u creep and u lay wit me? I remain a G little nigga that be maccin up got bitchez baccin up Im taking action. Niggas that be slaccin up lovin a nasty slut up in tha club catchin fatal attractions.

Will u be mad if I fucc and get on Im not lookin for love because I got it at home it doesn't matter that Im wrong, do when Im gone. Sippin tha Paul Mason blowin tha bomb, tha truth is my boo is my crazy baby mom (why u here wit me?) shh, keep calm this is only a creep not agreed to tha prom. U got yo nerve thinkin givin me bread, will get u more than a dicc u thicc in tha head? Tha minute u said u love a nigga u was lying cuz I heard another nigga had u crying in tha bed. I wasn't fed, up wit it, didn't give a fucc about it cuz Im T-Nutty. U can consider me one of your buddies and to tell u tha truth Im just lovin tha money and rubbin u honey. I'll go when it's sunny, show me when these hoes be jumpin bones like a bunny rabbit makin it a habbit, convincing me not to shake tha spot but I shake it because Im a paper addict. Baby girl I gotta have it lemmie let it be known. Im to be questioned girl because Im grown I'll stay gone for twenty-four hours beliving that money is power and only cowards get thay game devoured by they spouse. Im G when I work tha mouthpoece cuz Imma be treated like tha king of tha house. Blowing a blunt wit my dingaling out, mingaling and angiling after tha paper route. No doubt thug niggas need love, a kiss and a hug and all the above, but Im not the type to do too much to get it Im a menace to tha cat and rather rip and run\n\n[Chorus]"}], "artist": "T-Nutty"}
