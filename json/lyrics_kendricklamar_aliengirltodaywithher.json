No I.D. (That girl's an alien)\nAnd if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space\nUFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)\n\n[Verse 1]\nShe got me going, I'm all in\nFifty stories, I'm falling\nWhere you been? Is it planet Mars?\nFar beyond the stars? Are you a Martian?\nYou're unfamiliar but still, I feel ya\nEnergy sending me towards the ceiling\nI'm high now, are you up there?\nIf you was, I would climb every other stair\nI gotta stare, I mean wow\nAnd I'm wowed, no one compares\nA one-on-one, you must have won\nEvery pageant in America when you was young\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLips, hips, hair drips down her back\n(Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy)\nThe only girl that can make time\nThen make me, stop...\n\n[Chorus]\nShe looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie\nWhere's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)\nAnd if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space\nUFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo now we on, so now we going\nLiving in the city of the unknown\nI show her off, I stunt with her\nWe do it sweet, they look bitter\nLook at her get up, I hear 'em say\nBut why him? I hear 'em hate\nI laugh at it rather than jab at it\nThen continue eternal life as a crack addict\n'Cause I'm addicted, and you the drug\nCold turkey? No sir\nYou gotta be an Odyssey from heaven and above\nYou definitely know, probably I gotta give it up\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLips, hips, hair drips down her back\n(Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy)\nThe only girl that can make time\nThen make me, stop...\n\n[Chorus]\nShe looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie\nWhere's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)\nAnd if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space\nUFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)\n\n[Outro]\nYou something different, I'm glad I found you\nSo pretty, I'll never do anything to hurt you"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
