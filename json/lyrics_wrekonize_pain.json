Blige, Billie Holiday\nCharlie Parker, John Coltrane\nJimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain\nRoger Troutman, Marvin Gaye\nSee? You ain\u2019t got nothing to save\n\u2019cause everything about you is safe\nYou live in the prettiest place\nRivers and lakes, makin\u2019 serious cake\nYou talkin\u2019, but I ain\u2019t hearin\u2019 them thangs\nSleepwalkin\u2019, you ain\u2019t even really awake\nToo often, this is how you spend all your days\nIf this really the case, then it\u2019s really a race\nAnd maybe that\u2019s why I can\u2019t fuck with you\nYou too comfortable, you too huxtable\nPolice don\u2019t even fuck with you\nYou ain\u2019t seein\u2019 \u2019em leavin\u2019 people bleedin\u2019 right in front of you\nAll I see is white T-s, and popped collars\nPitbulls and rottweilers\nPeople who ain\u2019t got options\nMight as well keep the block poppin!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2 - Wrekonize]\nYeah\u2026 Ha!\nI could\u2019ve changed a life, could\u2019ve prevented one\nThe way it ended up, I must say I\u2019ve regretted some\nThey said I meant you wrong, and now my head is numb\nI know I walked the line, but never did I pretend to run\nI wrote this verse in blood, I\u2019m drinkin\u2019 Heaven\u2019s rum\nHoping the Armageddon comes, I\u2019m it\u2019s second son!\nYou quoted words of mine and truly as that record spun\nI heard the devil hum those melodies I\u2019ve been affected from!\nIt leaves me breathless, empty lungs\nSenseless, head is but a vessel for the medicine!\nI spit pain, backflippin\u2019 off of rebel\u2019s tongue\nNegative and never fond, this Netherworld has severed some\nAnd when it\u2019s all said and records done\nYou see I make sure to reflect the one emotion most would never strum\nI like my mirror with cracks, don\u2019t ever change\n\u2019cause most great art can\u2019t exist without pain!\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Pain", "year": "2013-01-31", "album": "The Rooftops Mixtape", "image": "https://images.genius.com/88e068903a4f33a883dd03382fcde905.700x700x1.jpg"}]}
