Woaaahhhhhh)\nShe leave her hair in the sink\nShe leave her hair on the floor\nHer hair all over the bed, that make me love her more\nShe wear a scarf, Louis V to be exact\nIt's a wrap, messing up her wrap, blowing out her back\nNever let another rap nigga hit it from back or the front\nOn my mama nigga, I be gone for months\nI come back\n(And it's still tight, I like when it's real tight)\nI'mma lick in circles now..\n(Tell me what that feel like)\nFeels like when you try them red bottoms on\nIt feels like the song cause we all the way gone..\nBetween me and you, do anything for old girl\nLike hit it in the morning, yeah, Cole World\n\n[Hook : Mario]\nBaby you're the one\nYou ain't gotta hit the club no more\nCause we done did that\nTryna find the one\nBut you been looking for love in all the wrong places\nEvery day's a movie, girl, you make the scene\nThey gon keep on watching, give em something to see\nWe gonna be all the way gone\nWe gonna be all the way gone\n\n[Verse 2 : Wale]\nShe call me all the time, I ain't no regular Joe\nI be staying at the Roosevelt more than Marilyn's ghost\nI met some bitches with Chuck, but I was wearing some Foams\nShorty been fly forever, these bitches' parachutes broke\nTC's is on her person I'm aware that you know\nAnd you know the flow, they jack it, I'm apparently cold, you know\nLife's lemons is bitter, I need another fruit\nShe know we can't elope, look at what honey do\nStraight G thing, double M G thing\nWeed they can't fuck with, I'm puffin A.C. Green\nWhen I peep in the public, bet I'm leaving with something\nAnd I'm so fly I make some homebodies ?? leave the luggage\nShout out Donny Sublime\nShout out Bobby on Hundreds\nNot too many is touching, double M G this summer\nThe RED album, lil red shortie, you can't touch her\nI know Mario's on the hook, but I was playing Duck Hunt\n\n[Hook : Mario]\n\n[Verse 3 : Game & (Mario)]\nYeah, he blowing up your cell phone\nSend him the voicemail cause we all the way gone\nAnd you ain't doing nothing wrong\nBut killing the competition in that Cosabella thong\nTurn to the side, let me see them thighs\nProfile, damn I'm digging your style, we can start slow now\nThen speed it up, this playing in the background\nWhile I beat it up - I beat it up\n(Baby soon as we get home, it won't take us too long)\n(We gon make it to the bedroom, I like the guest room)\n(You can pick the next room)\n(Put the camera on the tripod, got me playing on your iPod)\n(I know you feeling me on my job: Director)\nCut!"}]}
