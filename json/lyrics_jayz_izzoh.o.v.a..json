I gets bu-sy\n\n[Chorus]\nH to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A\nFor shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA\nH to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A\nThat's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!\n\nH to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A\nNot guilty, y'all got to feel me\nH to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A\nThat's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!\n\n[Outro]\nH to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A\nH to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A\nH to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A\nH to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A\nH to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A\nH to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A", "title": "Izzo (H.O.V.A.)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ad3d3452a06d4610dee9f32c3de4e193.300x300x1.jpg", "year": "2001-09-11", "album": "The Blueprint"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
