Pinnace for sin\nOne kept askin' the other kept screamin'\nThen I heard laugh it sound like a demon\nClosed my eyes, and one last breath\nPlease wake me if this is a dream\nAs quick as it all went down\nEverything went quiet, didn't hear a sound\nI open my eyes, all strucked\nThey were gone, faded, vanish... fuck\n\n[Hook x2]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/181444660a65d0000670a98f7f5af756.400x400x1.jpg"}]}
