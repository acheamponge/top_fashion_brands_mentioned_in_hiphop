Listen\nYou gon' end up missing\nYou know who gon' find you? Some old bitch fishing\nNo bitch, listen!\nI'm done with the game\nGot the sun through my back\nSee me off in the distance, damn\nNever'll be seen again\nSaid she ain't dome the squad\nNever believe your friends\nShe told me she on the pill\nI don't really give no fucks, Imma just leave it in\n\n[Chorus: Alex Wiley]\nI can't even stunt\nI can't even stunt we three Suburbans deep\nLook like the fuckin' federales when we roll up\nI can't even stunt\nI can't even stunt if you come through this\nSession with a swisher nigga\nYou don't even know us\nI can't even stunt\nI can't even stunt we three Suburbans deep\nLook like the fuckin' federales when we roll up\nI can't even stunt\nI can't even stunt if you come through this\nSession with a swisher nigga\nYou don't even know us\n\n[Verse 2: Pouya]\nI got a new corolla\nBendin' the corner, doin' yoga\nRace down all the time\nThe engine needs water, the seats don't recline\nThe AC don't work\nThe carpet got dirt\nI guess what I'm tryn'a say is\nYou mine so I love you regardless\nOne man's garbage, another man's goddess\nWe going through the car wash until you spotless\nPush a button just to see you topless\nI know the Lambos gossip, and the rovas too\nThey wanna know why I got a soft spot for you\nWe'd a been through a lot, had you parked in my spot every night\nAnd we never forgot to turn off the lights\nUntil that one day, I done slipped up\nAnd that tow truck\nPicked up my bitch\n\n[Chorus: Alex Wiley]\nI can't even stunt\nI can't even stunt we three Suburbans deep\nLook like the fuckin' federales when we roll up\nI can't even stunt\nI can't even stunt if you come through this\nSession with a swisher nigga\nYou don't even know us\nI can't even stunt\nI can't even stunt we three Suburbans deep\nLook like the fuckin' federales when we roll up\nI can't even stunt\nI can't even stunt if you come through this\nSession with a swisher nigga\nYou don't even know us", "title": "Claire", "album": "*one singular flame emoji ep*"}], "artist": "Alex Wiley"}
