Somebody give that man a hug\nSaying I'm a thief somebody must've hand them drugs\nThey thought OOOUUU was the only thing I had for 'em\nThey thought I ain't have something in the stash for 'em\nI see a crown damn right I'ma grab for it\nWhere I'm from, we just take it we don't ask for it\nOn my way to success I got a map for it\nAnd for my dreams, yup, I'm still running laps for it\nYou can see it in my eyes, it's still hunger there\nI'm still looking to the sky 'cause my brother there\nWent from stashing O.Z.'s in my underwear\nTo 2016 being my fucking year\nNow I'm back here another year\nAnd I see more haters, but you looking in your account and it's nothing there\nDon't get mad, get money, get on your grizzy\nI don't respond to you niggas because I'm busy\nMy eyes low because I'm tipsy sipping that Don Pizzy\nHad to chill on that Henny for my my liver and kidneys\nHair still frizzy\nLoud still pissy\nHow much we get for a show? Between 40 and 60\nIndependent at my own label\nAt my own table and I'm so grateful\nWhat don't break you make you\nSo to them motherfuckers throwing stones, thank you", "album": null, "year": "2017-02-24", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eac22acf0996fe81401676d52fe00183.803x803x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young M.A"}
