So is my dad\nI'm lying, he's a fag that got shot in Baghdad\nHow 'bout I pull on a pink wig, how 'bout you wear a shower cap\nHow 'bout I stab you six hours while you take a fuckin' nap?\n\nChorus (2x)\n\n[Verse 2]\n(My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I do know you, baby, maybe, cause I follow you on Twit-Twit-Twit-Twit-Twitter...\nAnd Facebook [yeah], and Myspace [fuck yeah] and Youtube [what], and Pink Friday)\n\nHey Onika, it's nice to meet you\nI wanna invite you to a, dollar slice a pizza\nPut our trunks on, and dive in a pool\nHow 'bout we have lunch at, Blackwell middle school\n\nIt's the end of the world, it's almost armageddon\nIf you and Drake get married, I'm fuckin' up the weddin'\nKnockin' over tables, spittin' food\nKuniva, make sure J-Cole's don't make a move\n\nI'm obsessed with you, Nick, I'm just like Stan\nI wanna be you girlfriend, and your best friend\nAnd I heard about your daddy, tryna blow up the house\nNext time I see him, I'mma blow out his mouth\n\nAnd tell Jacob, to take off that makeup\nAnd matter a fact, you and Lil' Kim should make up\nI'mma say one more thing before I leave...\nRemember, \"I will eat your pussy for life... for life... for life\"\n\n[Laughs]"}], "artist": "Bizarre"}
