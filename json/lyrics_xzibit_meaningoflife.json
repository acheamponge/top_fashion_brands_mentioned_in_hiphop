name is staff sergeant Shilo Harris, retired United States army\nUnfortunately, while serving our nation\nI was hit with a roadside bomb that was estimated at about 800 pounds of explosives\nI lost 3 soldiers, my truck was destroyed\nMy driver and I were the only 2 soldiers out of that vehicle that survived\n\n[Hook:]\nSo what's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I don't know, I don't know\nCuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage\nGrand larceny, cause I'm stealin' the show\nWhat's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya\nAll I know if you spend too much time without being refined\nThen your life will be described as a failure\n\n[Verse 1:]\nLet me tell you about these bitch ass, half cocked, pussy ass niggas\nThat's never gon' pull the trigger to protect no figures\nNever seen a hard time in your life\nBeating the shit out of your kids and your wife\nCause what you lack in a fight\nThat we all fightin' a similar, self-hated mutilation\nThe lost angel, Los Angeles, congratulations\nFrom admiration, to aggravation, to the highest level\nDon't be surprised you all alone when that dust settle\nHeart colder than gun metal, I done survived it all\nPraying for my downfall, got the fuck from around y'all\nNo more niggas bringing me down, even including myself\nI celebrate life for nobody else\nMountains of wealth ain't really shit without health\nMy mental shrouded in stealth\nCause hell is crowded with cowards who fell for the dollar\nNow watch Xzibit rise to power\nI turn these 15 minutes to hours\nBut still asking\n\n[Hook:]\nWhat's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I don't know, I don't know\nCuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage\nGrand larceny cause I'm stealin' the show\nWhat's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya\nAll I know if you spend too much time without being refined\nThen your life will be described as a failure\n\n[Verse 2:]\nLet me tell you bout' these hypocrites and halfwits\nCaught up in the politics\nWork yourself to death, but uncle Sam is taking all of it\nPrisoner to the policy, the mark of the beast\nBecoming one with technology, surveillance a beach (bitch)\nAnd everyone one of us, some of us got no heart or no backbone\nThe few will seek freedom while most of the masses will conform\nThe woman you lust for, is usually not the one\nTo stick around when you go to war\nImmaculate platform\nWe back and prepared for, attacking the landlords\nCause this shit too hot, we 'bout to get what we came for\nAnd if I should die, may it not be in vain more\nImportantly, more to see, keep it cracking and orderly\nGot my future in front of me, focus is fucking phenomenal\nNobody can touch us, I turn the impossible possible with it\nDo me a favor man, do not try to tell me shit\nIt's just me and my bitch\n\n[Hook:]\nWhat's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I don't know, I don't know\nCuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage\nGrand larceny cause I'm stealin' the show\nWhat's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I couldn't tell ya, I can't tell ya\nAll I know if you spend too much time without being refined\nThen your life will be described as a failure\n\n[Shilo Harris:]\nWhen I was injured, I sustained 35% burns over my body\nI lost my ears, my nose, and have been through many reconstructive surgeries\nMy father was there, my wife was there, my children\nThat was a lot of my motivation, was because\nI knew the way that they were looking at me\nI had to get stronger, I had to become independent again\nAnd I think that's why I pushed so hard\n\n[Verse 3:]\nLet me tell you 'bout these long days and sleepless nights\nPenny pinchin' trying to make it to the afterlife\nAnd not to mention time is short, you better make it right\nBefore you see that final light get all your business tight\nThis is the gospel, gotta get it or get left alone\nSo get it on until your destiny is set in stone\nThe dead and gone can never tell us what comes after death\nSo make it count and live your life out loud with no regrets\nThis for the set, this for the ones that's never wakin' up\nLivin' a fantasy, insanity, they fake as fuck\nThey out of touch, they out of line, it's time to face the truth\nThat I wasn't supposed to make it, now I'm living proof\nExcavated mountains of misery, eventually found the fountain of youth\nIt'd been pissed in, shit in, violated, so they pollute\nThat's why they shoot, have your ass in a box dressed in a suit\n'Bout time you got in touch with your roots\n\n[Hook:]\nSo what's the meaning of life, what's the meaning of life?\nMan I don't know, I don't know\nCuz all I know is when I grab the microphone and they let me up on the stage\nGrand larceny cause I'm stealin' the show\nWhat's the meaning of life?\n\n[Shilo Harris:]\nThe best help that you can do, is help yourself\nYou have to, to step up, you have to find the strength inside of you\nTo pull yourself through it, because, you know, you can\nYou can have people pull you everyday\nBut unless you're willing to move, and you're willing to move forward\nThen you're gonna be stuck in a rut\nAnd you're gonna be stuck in that bad place that is depressing\nAnd holding you back\nThe only person that can set you free is yourself"}], "artist": "Xzibit"}
