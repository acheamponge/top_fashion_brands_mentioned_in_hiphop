Look at me now, dickhead\n\n[Verse 3: 360]\nUh, I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired\nUh, I'd rather be fit and wired\nYeah, I'd rather be givin' time\nTo makin' an impact and leavin' these kids inspired\nNow I'm someone they can look up to\nIf you're down, brother, know that you can look up too\nIf they gettin' in your way you can push on through\nAnd if they tell you that you can't tell 'em, \"Good, fuck you\"\nNever thought as an innocent teen\nThat this'd be me, the shit that I breathe, but I love it now\nUnderstand there's a difference between us\nLivin' the dream and livin' in dreams, I am above the clouds\n\n[Chorus (Sampled): Max McElligott]\nSleeping with my back to yours\nBack to back, back to back, we're strung out\nSleeping with my back to yours\nDon't walk away, don't walk away"}]}
