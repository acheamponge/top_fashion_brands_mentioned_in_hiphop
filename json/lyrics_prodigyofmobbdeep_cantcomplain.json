(right in my sock.)\nYo, I hope these fuckin' dicks won't find the stash spot\nDunn, you know how I get down\nYo I'm ready to bounce\nDo the 100 yard-dash and tear ass\nIf my other half was alive we woulda got killt\n'cause dunn woulda went for the guns and got ill\nPlus I got cracks on me, they found the cracks on me\nLooked at 'em, gave 'em back to me\nI could've swore they was takin' us in\nThen the lady in the car said, \"that's not them.\"\nPicked us up, told me I could keep the drugs\nThey didn't give a fuck, they was only lookin' for guns\nAnd you ain't gotta tell us twice\nWe hopped in the car and slid off\nOn our way uptown for more of that funk\nP lit the tree back up\nGot off the Triborough, hit the Henry Huds'\n\"Fuck it, let's slide through the Ruckers.\"\nRoll the windows down cuz Infamous Mobb bumpers...\n\n[Verse 3: Prodigy]\nSkip To My Lou had the crowd jumpin'\nTook a walk through the park frontin'\nDidn't even have to hurt nuttin'\nMan I love it, ain't nothin' like summer in New York\nHear Infamous Thoughts, then the Dream Team music starts\nDamn, we young black entrepreneurs\nNew York Pricks and Dicks can't stop our floss\nWe like organized crime, the fuckin' Mobb\nI'm only twenty-six playin' wit' serious cards\nDead serious cash, luxurious labs\nLearn to balance fame with pain, you can't complain\n\n[Chorus: Chinky]\nJust another day, livin' in the hood\nJust another day around the way\nFeelin' good today\nOh no we can't complain\nJust another day livin' in New York\nDealin' with the jakes and the snakes\nFeelin' good today\nWe hit 'em up cuz we here to stay", "year": "2000-11-14"}]}
