Leave that in\n\n[Bridge 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nYou make me sick, then you get me better\nYou crack me up just to put me back together\nInfinite wisdom.  Now and forever, overstand\nPots and pans, real trendsetters\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nMany couldn\u2019t see the light when the Sun was dawning\nTried to play me like a crackhead\u2014four in the morning\nSelling VCRs.  If you C-Rayz Walz, then\nYou know who I are.  Exactly\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nI swim with planks, walk the sharks\nBlow up the charts with explosive darts, then part\nMe and Noah went to McDonald\u2019s and stole the Ark\nIn the huddle cut to construct the double-up mission like, \u201cWhat?\u201d\nNever beef with burgers\u2014I\u2019ll burn before flipping\nPolly with parakeets, hear myself speak and listen\nThe fast life: blast mics.  In the house, I\u2019m street\nDon\u2019t sleep.  I could reenact yours in a week\nThe Lord of the Flies born in disguise (Surprise!), Superion\nNagasaki blaze, Autopsy Five\nThis flow wet, at shows get with more water than Frisco\nWe old vets fully erect in the presence of your bitch flow\nFunk Buddha.  Off the top, I jump tutors\nTrack-movers backsmack rap acts and hack computers\nCats pursue the heavy shit I drop like stacked manure\nK. Lew produced the wax.  Don\u2019t let the facts confuse ya\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nMany couldn\u2019t see the light when the Sun was dawning\nTried to play me like a crackhead\u2014four in the morning\nSelling VCRs.  If you C-Rayz Walz, then\nYou know who I are.  Exactly\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nYo, I\u2019m murking\nVerbs, kicking the bass with my car dirking \u2018burbs\nThen squirt on birds who act like they ain\u2019t slurping turds\n(Fuck you!) You get on my flurking nerves.  Broken words\nIn the hospital talking to the nurse with a curse and slur\nYou ever notice cowgirls always lurk in herds?\nAnd moose dudes with a loose fuse look so absurd?\nI\u2019m cool.  I\u2019m just came home from hurricane verb\nGet your purse disturbed for rocking iceberg furs, you heard?\nI\u2019m killing the streets\u2014I\u2019ll be hurting curbs\nThree-time felon, I\u2019m telling you second person\u2019s first\nMy splurge in blurts, so I\u2019ll make sure my weapon works\nHave you burst in splurts, bizarre like bourbon burps\nSurfing the \u2018burbs, observing worthless jerks, searching\nThe Earth, preserving the purpose is my curse and worse\nNervous birds perch in the church and chirp and rehearse\nKilling the sixteen while I\u2019m burping the verse and still thirst\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nMany couldn\u2019t see the light when the Sun was dawning\nTried to play me like a crackhead\u2014four in the morning\nSelling VCRs.  If you C-Rayz Walz, then\nYou know who I are.  Exactly\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nSnatch your patch out space, smack myself in the face\n\u2018Til the good\u2019s in the hood.  Out of states, I\u2019m to the greats\nYou see me in the news rocking lightning shoes\nLike I went to Mount Olympus and robbed Zeus\nWrite rhymes on Pampers, drop shit often\nTuberculosis brothers in a day room coughing\nWhile the end begins, I see slaves with freedom\nWhy politick with derelicts?  I independently need them\nI\u2019m serious.  You think I\u2019m funny, fool?\nYou son of a gun, your mother\u2019s a broke twenty-two\nYour pops is a forty-five with an empty clip\nThe sperm cell met the egg like, \u201cHe sent me...\u201d\nLike spliffs that don\u2019t lie/lye, this is my true joint\nCrossbred with pig cows, make you scream, \u201cMoo, oink\u201d\nWe off the roof, land on clouds, get it on\nOff the top.  Yeah, you know how we get down\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nMany couldn\u2019t see the light when the Sun was dawning\nTried to play me like a crackhead\u2014four in the morning\nSelling VCRs.  If you C-Rayz Walz, then\nYou know who I are.  Exactly\n\n[Verse 4: C-Rayz Walz]\nYo, if the streets is crying, the crib is hurting\nMad \u2018cause the bonus track on your bootleg C-Rayz tape ain\u2019t working\nSink overflower, you pink Motorola.  I think I\u2019m\nStronger than ginseng, ginkgo biloba\nI\u2019ll work out while I\u2019m driving, pushup and pull over\nWhile you stand still, running your mouth with a broken molar\nUtilize fans when my chapter\u2019s bent.  And with\nThe right hook, this could be a car accident\nI\u2019m the type to spit a hot verse that deserves replay\nThen get on some humble shit like, \u201cYo, give it up for DJ!\u201d\nI\u2019m blessed with the WPIX flow.  (What?) \u201cWhat?\nWhat\u2019s your opinion?  We\u2019d like to know\u201d\nOn the permanent vacation, I\u2019m temporarily stuck\nPlus, I\u2019m overly concerned about not giving a fuck\nDeep work cold chilling with no T-shirt.  Dropping\nThis shit twice, call it the \u201cReturd\u201d until we return\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nMany couldn\u2019t see the light when the Sun was dawning\nTried to play me like a crackhead\u2014four in the morning\nSelling VCRs.  If you C-Rayz Walz, then\nYou know who I are.  Exactly"}]}
