Yea!\nI try to weed out the real from the fake ones\nTwo faced ones, won't you keep it real son\nI can see it from a mile away\nCause I'm holding it down with my feet on the ground\nAnd they\n\n[Pre-Chorus]  They're trying to break me, They're trying to rape me\nThey're trying to bring me down\nThey're trying to break me, They're trying to rape me\nThey're trying to bring me down\n\n[Chorus]  I know there's something going on (and it seems so cold)\nI know there's something going on (and it won't be long)\nI know there's something going on (how could you be so cold)\nI know there's something going wrong!   yea!\n\n[Verse 2]\nEvil lurks when you look around\nAnd then you know how it's goin down\nI look deep and figure how to break free\nIn my plan, escape from reality\nI see you scoping on my life and now he tells me\nYou look suspicious and your plan is tryin to gank me\nThe main suspect but you're the reject\nYou'll be the one with the gun, no respect for me\nI roll deep like Bond, I got a blueprint\nCreep in your area, low right through the residence\nLike a sniper, control the damager\nFlippin the script, cause I'm two steps ahead of ya\n\n[Pre-Chorus repeat]\n\n[Chorus repeat]\n\nI know there's something on\nI know there's something on (can't get this out of my head)\n\n[Chorus repeat]", "album": "Bi-Polar: Skabz", "image": "https://images.genius.com/59251b7fa08499183d8cba480fbeeb28.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
