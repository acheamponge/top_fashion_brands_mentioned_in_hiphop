I don't care\nYou are my future, I wanna be where you are\nDon\u2019t know what to do love. cause you're so damn far\nSo I'm flying down that road, flying down that road\nWay down that road, flying down that road\nTrying to catch up to you, flying down that road\nWay down that road, flying down that road\nCheck it out, way down that road\nTrying to catch up to you, just trying to catch up to you\nBring her home man\nJust trying to catch up to you\nYou trying to catch, \u2026 way down that road", "title": "Down That Road"}]}
