Pass you walking in the rain\nSeize the moment\nOpportunity awaits you, never let it pass you by\nConsequences come plenty chances, not many\nBut baby you were born to shine\nTake a look at my life\nYou will see there is more than what happens online\nIt's a sign of the times\nWhen that is enough to feel you know my strife\nStay prayed up the Most High\nHas my destiny written, my stars will align\nAnd no hate can withhold me my faith is divine\nYou will see\n\n[Hook: Eric \"Blakk Soul\" Keith]\nFools lay low in the winter\nJust ride in the summer\nSun so warm but the streets so cold\nAin't no love in my city\nIf you knew what I've been through\nIf you'd seen what my eyes have seen\nYou would understand just how I move\n\n[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]\nFlying high 30,000 feet\nFeeling a little awkward in my seat\nHope the lady next to me don't speak I need sleep\nDistant memories begin to creep in\nRemember that weekend?\nYour body felt a little weakened\nThen your inner voice started speaking\nFour long days in a haze you amazed you barely made it\nThere's a thin line between life and death that you skating\nLike getting rushed to the emergency\nSomewhere in the north east and you need attention urgently\nThe jaws of life prying me from the wreckage\nPopping percocets on stage, we wanting seconds\nOr maybe there's a lack in communication\nThat then leads to the frustration\nWe want it now, niggas ain't patient\nLong couch, feeling like a patient who won't say shit\nShip sinking, heavy drinking\nFuck rap when your life's spiraling out of control\nBut all they wanna know is \"When that new shit coming?\"\nStanding on stage by myself, heart drumming\nPour your soul out, they ain't coming\nStep outside box they go running\nI'm giving up a piece of me\nOpen up for a piece to see\nIt's all peace when you finally free\n\n[Hook: Eric \"Blakk Soul\" Keith]\nFools lay low in the winter\nJust ride in the summer\nSun so warm but the streets so cold\nAin't no love in my city\nIf you knew what I've been through\nIf you'd seen what my eyes have seen\nYou would understand just how I move"}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
