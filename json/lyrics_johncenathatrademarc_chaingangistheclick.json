With a molly rose\nY'all belly meatin beef and nothing but Bologna foes\nYour phony flows we stopping your rise\nWe own the game y'all is leasing with the option to buy\nYour flight been delayed kid you not gonna fly\nWe got the army throw your hands to the sky\nThis is Chain Gang, bitch don't bother to check us\nY'all don't got to like us but you gon' respect us, motherfucker\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 2: Tha Trademarc]\nListen baby I'm just tryin to eat\nJust the same game that put the chain gang in the street\nGot goons with a few hundred clips in the heat\nIt seems sex violence and money are dyin to meet\nGod damn I'm a fan this music moved me\nI found writing rhymes all the time would soothe me\nDon't lose me never let the truth allude me\nThe skills I respect are expected duelly\nSome got gifts man but reflect it crudely\nThat why I keep it real like rejected movies\nWhat now and no what was or would be\nOnly sing along if you understood me\nThe scene hip hop dawg ain't were it could be\nTrademarc will take y'all right where it should be\nYou actors and that's where it stops\nWe stars on stage y'all are decorative props - what now?\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 3: tha Trademarc]\nLook man, my voice christenin beats\nYour vision see ripples on concrete from glistenin heat\nWhenever I speak, I walk streets\nCalm when I creep\nTrademarc, John Cena, Freddie Foxx, and rup Corrupt Mob\nThe Chain Gang spittin the same slang\nLet the iron go bang bang and came lame\nChurch bells ring ring to all y'all coppin the lock let it hang hang\n\n[Verse 4: John Cena]\nYall think we lucky that ain't nothin new to me\nCause luck is preparation lockin heads with opportunity\nSo far I just had to listen and learn\nPlay my position and earn with the vision and burn\nNow the shit is all turned and im reppin for pride\nWhere I'm from you either step up or step aside\nWant some get some stop drop and peril\nChain Gang run this bitch lock stock and barrel\n\n[Hook x2]\n\nWe fight together, we ride together\nRight now we gonna get loud together\nChain gang is the click"}], "artist": "John Cena & Tha Trademarc"}
