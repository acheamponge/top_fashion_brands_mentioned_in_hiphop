Cause I feel fed up!\nFeel like you\u2019re stuck in your ways, and you won\u2019t let up!\nQuestion, like persecution, no retribution\nEnough is enough, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing!\nGot the weight of the world on me, can you help me out?\nDon\u2019t add to the low, please, I\u2019m really stressing out!\nThinking the grass is greener when you\u2019re single\nSick and tired of arguing, so I change my demeanor\nShe wants to talk, I say we do!\nShe says that we\u2019re not friends, and I just say it\u2019s you!\nWe feel like strangers, but what's stranger is this feeling!\nLove never leaves, if it\u2019s true, I hope it soon makes an appearance!\n\n[Hook: Natalie Lauren] (x2)"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
