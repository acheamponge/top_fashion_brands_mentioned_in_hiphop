Well, I'm back in the stu, in the stu\nLike Hangover 2 with a Tyson tattoo\nThey want a new classic? Well, I'm writing that too\nMoney, cars, hoes, chains\nDope flows, females, wait?\nThey got no content and subject, fam, they emails blank\nPaint a picture and tell whatever the details can't\nBuildin' a movement, them haters making my retail wait\nWhen they go on sale, put it on the scale\nPraying that it do well, and weigh as much as blue whales\nDropping bars for all of them broads who bailed\nSmoking that cool J, giving haters 2 L's\nPerfect timing, I started popping with rhyming\nI was close to getting a job at Furniture on Consignment\nTapping on the table and spinning around in a chair man\nNow it's deals on the table with the chairman\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "XV"}
