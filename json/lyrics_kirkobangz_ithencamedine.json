I could ride black\nI done came down with Versace backpack\nPink lemonade, chillin' in the shade\nGot kicked out the 8th grade for playin' with a razorblade\nBaller berry soup, name on my suit\nIce so blue I done damn near caught the flu\nThey wanna see me fold, hard rose gold\nMaybe made the thunder, maybe Kurt Angle\nBroke the boys off, Rolex on my ankle\nListen to RiFF RAFF, I can make my trunk crack\nI done came down with the candy Apple Jack\nMaybe need some Benjamins, mothafuck a Benz\nMothafuck a trend, aquaberry Lam with the hyper white lens\nDrove through a hurricane and didn't spill my drank\nJODY HiGHROLLER weigh about a army tank\nI weigh about tornado multiplied by the Sun\n\n[Hook]"}]}
