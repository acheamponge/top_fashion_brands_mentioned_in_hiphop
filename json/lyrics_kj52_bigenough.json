Pick it up\n\n[Verse 1: KJ-52]\nCruising but I hustle fast\nLike Usain in a 100 dash I'm just\nNew school but I'm from the past\nLike wu tang in a 100 masks I just\nDo thangs with a 100 raps\nTo make a crowds say ho like a thundercat\nHit the line like a running back\nUntil I run in back when I run the track\nI ain't where I used to be\nI ain't what they used to see\nBut my Lord been good to me\nSo I got no malice like Pusha T\nI'm a rapper/pastor\nYou are a rapper/actor\nYour life plus no christ\nThat is a crashing disaster\nI got to blast smash faster\nWhen I blast smash past ya\nHold tight now it's all right\nHe coming back to just snatch ya\nI'm blasting off past NASA\nIn my sneaks and cap backwards\nSo blast the song past at ya\nUntil I'm gone in that rapture\n\n[Chorus: Xay Hill & KJ-52]\nKeep it up keep it up\nTell the whole world we be keeping up\nTell the whole squad we ain't giving up\nGod on our side we gone run it up\nKeep it up keep it up\nTell the whole world we be keeping up\nTell the whole squad we ain't giving up\nGod on our side we gone run it up\nTell your team they ain't big enough\nTell your dreams they ain't big enough\nTell them schemes they ain't big enough\nYou hit the ground? Pick it up\n\n[Verse 2: KJ-52]\nStep up pull out the pen again\nI'm just the dude now to get it in\nSwimming in the rhythm that I'm living in\nOr sipping Lipton at the Bennagins\nPrivate jet or the mini van\nI'm living better than I ever been\nI kill the flesh till it's trembling\nLike Eddie Brock in the venom and\nYou claim you packing you getting yo' chips\nLike it was a packet of Pringle in's\nI'm in the back stacking and macking\nChewing some gum full a cinnamon\nCause just when I'm rapping I'll bet that it happens\nI get you with the nouns and the synonyms\nCatch me now laughing I'm smashing the lines\nI hit you like a jacket from Benny Hinn\nYou got the goons in the truck\nI got the spoons in a cup\nMan I just grew up in a dump\nEating up soup in a cup\nSo I just do it for the love\nAnd I'm just moving it up\nAnd I'm pursing him yuhh\nCuz I knew he's enough\n\n[Chorus Xay Hill & KJ-52]\nKeep it up keep it up\nTell the whole world we be keeping up\nTell the whole squad we ain't giving up\nGod on our side we gone run it up\nKeep it up keep it up\nTell the whole world we be keeping up\nTell the whole squad we ain't giving up\nGod on our side we gone run it up\nTell your team they ain't big enough\nTell your dreams they ain't big enough\nTell them schemes they ain't big enough\nYou hit the ground? Pick it up\nTell your team they ain't big enough\nTell your dreams they ain't big enough\nTell them schemes they ain't big enough\nYou hit the ground? Pick it up"}]}
