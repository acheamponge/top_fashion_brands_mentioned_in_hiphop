Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you?\n\nWhen she swam under the moonlight\n\nWho the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?\nWho the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?\n\nShe grew popular\nThere was no stop'n her\nShe started losing sight\nAnd she forgot about\n\nWho the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you? Who the f**k you?\n\nMe and her in the river at night\n\nWho the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?\nWho the f**k you dissin bitch remember me I was there for you?\n\nThe girl forgot about\n\nWho the f**k you?
