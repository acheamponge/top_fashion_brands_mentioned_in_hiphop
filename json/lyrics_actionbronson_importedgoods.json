Honda a thousand, slap you with the whole hand\nSex a dime, herbally, a blessed time\nCheck the rhyme motherfucker, better recognize\n\n[Hook]\nThis for my people making sales until they back hurt\nSee the beast on the creep, they let the Mac squirt\nBitch on the backs, that do the dippies on the bikes, and\nLoud pipes and rocking leathers like a wild Viking\nMy man who just came home, and some are going up\nFiends up in the alley, sippin Balley fucking throwing up\nKeep your mind straight, focus on the prize\nAlways diving into thighs, blowing smoke into the skies\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe eyes slanted from the origami, I roll a quarter of the water\nNear the border, where you oughta find me\nThe Tamborine Man pumping while the Tyson burning\nAir Tech Challenge, clay court, checks balance\nStay endorsing that weak shit, my team spit\nThat mean shit, like stepping in some fiend's shit\nNow you sick to your stomach because you stunted\nWord got fronted, another motherfucking jerk confronted\nPost pattern, Lonnie threw the loaf at 'em\nFlushing, motherfucker, keep a toast up by the gold Saturn\nLittle doulas on the block we tell 'em \"go stab 'em\"\nRelieve him of his shoes, it's easier to toe tag 'em'\nCarhartt sets and Horseys like the Preakness\nBronson love a freak bitch, dining on that Greek dish\nThat's the a-hole, all my people AWOL\nCash inside the case and now the judges want to play ball\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Imported Goods", "album": "Bon Appetit.....
