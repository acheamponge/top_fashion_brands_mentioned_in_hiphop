Paper on my phone line\nIt's on my phone like fax for me, that's facts to me\nBut I don't want it if it can't change shit drastically, dramatically\n'Cause actually, I realized time's the most valuable, actually\nSo I'ma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me\nAnd as for me, I'ma text the room number right now\nSo you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me\nDon't ask for me, don't ask for me\nDon't ask for me\nLot of shit been goin' on, things goin' wrong\nSo don't ask for me\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm hangin' halfway off the balcony\nOverthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary\nEverything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy\nI realized when it comes to girls\nThat chemistry means way more than anatomy\nShe mad at me, she been mad at me\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe been mad, I've been on the go, on the road\nOn a roll more than a roller coaster\nThey can't throw me off track or slow\nIf I did, I got a long list of hoes on hoes\nThat quote on quote, say I told you so\nHeaven on earth, every night is paradise\nI pray I didn't die or overdose, never that\nI kept it a hundred, never change, not even for five 20s\nStill smokin' at 5:20 like it's 4:20\nOn a quest for more money, more hungry\nJust got my fortune read, she said it's more comin'\nYeah I got the force but never force nothin'\nDo it for the love, I'm Forrest Gumpin'\nIn my city I'm Warren Buffett\nI mean business, the shirt is tucked in\nThe gun's tungsten, fuck it, I'm who not to fuck with\nWho the bad bitches gon' fuck with and lames just don't fuck with\nMy stock's risin', I'm goin' public, if I write it, it's gon' publish\nYou're fuckin' with the best, no discussion\n\n[Interlude]\nSo disgusting\nIt's that 3 and a third shit\nStraight up\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm hangin' halfway off the balcony\nOverthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary\nEverything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy\nI realized when it comes to girls\nThat chemistry means way more than anatomy\nShe mad at me, she been mad at me\nShe been mad\n\n[Outro]\nElder Big Sean: I think you should answer...\nMan: Yo, yo your mom callin' you\nBig Sean: Um, I'ma call her back\nMan: You sure dawg? She keep callin'\nBig Sean: Yeah for sure, for sure, bruh, I'ma call her back"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
