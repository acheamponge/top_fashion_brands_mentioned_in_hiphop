It's me\nGrandma: Hey baby!\nLecrae: Hey, I need you to pray for me. I'm just going through some things right now\nGrandma: Well, what's going on?\nLecrae: Well, you know, just everything. Family, money, just life in general. It's crazy\nGrandma: Well, let me tell you what the good Lord say, He said don't be anxious about yo' life. What you gon' eat or what you gon' drink or about yo' body\nSee, life is more than food, and the body is more than for clothing\nBirds in the sky, they don't sow, they don't reap, but yo' heavenly Father feeds 'em. So, He say just seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to ya'. See, life ain't for you to control, or carry all the burdens. That's why ya' give ya' life to Him. Hang on"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
