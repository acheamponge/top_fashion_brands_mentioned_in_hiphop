Where do we go?\nYou could fill up the sea with the things I don't know\nBut I know what I feel and I know when it's real\nAnd I hope that we heal\nWe're two drops of the blood and the tears\nOver thousands of years of the clash of the steel\nI'm not blind to the cycle\nWe\u2019re pressed in the spine of a Bible\nThey define the divine by the title\nBut what did Christ say? To be kind to my rival\nYou're my kind of revival\nIt's true ya, my favorite Hallelujah\nYou my you my favorite Hallelujah\n\n[Chorus 2]\nSarajevo, Sarajevo\nYou're the altar that I pray to\nGod is love and love is all we have\nSarajevo, Sarajevo\nI will honor and be faithful\nGod is love and love is all we have\n\n[Outro]\nSarajevo, Sarajevo\nYou're the altar that I pray to\nGod is love and love is all we have\nSarajevo, Sarajevo\nYou're the altar that I pray to\nGod is love and love is all we have\nSarajevo, Sarajevo\nYou're the altar that I pray to\nGod is love and love is all we have\nSarajevo, Sarajevo\nYou're the altar that I pray to\nGod is love and love is all we have", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0199ac49c667975a2b0c5188cae549aa.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "All You Can Do", "title": "Sarajevo"}]}
