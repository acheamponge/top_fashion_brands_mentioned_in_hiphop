WORM KING!!\nHere to teach you strange things\nThey slammed me on my chest to earth with clipped off wings\nSo trynna flap squirtin' with your bitch if shes hurtin'\nMy worms crawled in her, then crawled out through venti.. lation\nGot 16 hearts all palpitating\nMutate half way through the manifestation\nI got 5 star ratings on my dick, rapin'\nScrappin' your brains with the brush of death\nSent for some fuckin' \"NOISES!!\"\nWith no bitch ass accent\nMilitant experiment goin' AWOL!\nPlus your runnin' down the block with your ripped off face, call\nThe Son of Pontius if your martyrs is feelin' monstrous\nMy subconscious projects psychedelics mirages under garages\nI split jeans like a hulk scientist\nSlobbin' off the hook with the fuckin' worm bitch\nFuckin' worm bitch, fuckin' worm bitch"}]}
