How come you don't see that?...You think black cops is...more spiritual? You think better qualified? Nah...They got enough sense to know that white folks ain't going to tolerate it...And the only reason they do to us what they do cause you tolerate it. Ok, I'm not telling you don't chastise these young men! But I ain't see you chastise the police!!\n\n[Intro]\nHahahaha Real bad guy shit\nHahaha Living like a villain\nNever chilling heavy influence on your chillun\nYeah!\n\n[Verse 1]\nI woke up this morning to a cop with a gun\nWho told me that he looking for a nigga on the run\nI thought for a second and I screwed my face\nAnd asked them dirty pigs, \u201cWhy the fuck you in my place?\u201d\nHe said \u201cChill or we kill, this is a warning\u201d\nThen I told him \u201cFuck you, where is the warrant?\u201d\nThen they got to punching and kicking and macing\nThen the whole situation went Larry Davis\nThinking \u2019bout my lady and thinking \u2019bout my baby\nThinking, \u201cIs these motherfucking pigs going crazy\u201d\nThey wanna kill a nigga \u2019cause a nigga on his rap shit\nWanna leave me dead on a mattress, Hampton\nI\u2019m a Public Enemy because I\u2019m Cold Lampin\u2019\nAnd I don\u2019t give a fuck about a party in the Hamptons\nAnd I don\u2019t give a fuck about a motherfuckin' Forbes list\nFar as I\u2019m concerned, that\u2019s a motherfuckin' whores list\n\n[Bridge]\nMotherfucker, my dad was a cop\nYou don\u2019t think I know a dirty ass cop when I see one?\nShake down, take down, disrespecting-the-badge-ass-bitch!\n\n[Verse 2]\nBack to the scene going wild in the bedroom\nGrab the cop\u2019s gun left from leaking with a head wound\nSecond cop shot, but the bullet hit his partner\nShot him in the leg and he hit a main arter\nNow the dirty cop\u2019s looking at me\nTalking \u2019bout he kill a nigga if I try to flee\nShit, I\u2019m about to lose it, so he gon\u2019 have to prove it\nAll because the government hate rap music\nI\u2019ve been labeled outlaw, renegade, villain\nSo was Martin King, so the system had to kill him\nA nigga with an attitude, the world gotta feel him\nEducated villain, Intent on living\nIf I gotta kill a cop just to get out the building\nThat motherfucker gettin' left dead no feelings\nYelling \u201cFuck him\u201d as I buck A 45 at his fillings\nTrying to knock his brains through the motherfucking ceiling\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen I surface on the streets I can hear the crowd yelling\nAnd see the neighborhood snitches pointing and telling\nI\u2019m bailing like a felon or Assata Shakur\nBefore the law leave me stinking like a bag of manure\nLike Jeriko One in the movie \u2018Strange Days\u2019\nThey want a nigga dead \u2019cause the things that I say\nMight make the youth go and pick up an AK\nTell the government \u201cFuck you, no way\u201d\nLike John Connor mama I be running everyday\n\u2018Cause if I get caught it\u2019s my life they terminate\nOr stick me in a cell on Guantanamo Bay\nAll because a nigga won't submit and obey\nI\u2019ll be an outlaw before I ever behave\nAnd die a free man before I live like a slave\nNothing changes, if they catch me today\n\u201cFuck the police\u201d is still all I gotta say"}]}
