That lady who never, never turned her back on a nigga.  That one lady who no other woman could be\u2014no matter what, man.  Let\u2019s reflect for a moment, my real\n\n[Hook]\nIf this world were mine\nI would place at your feet\nAll that I own\nYou've been so good to me\n\n[Verse 1]\nI wrote about stickin' the mamis\nWrote about lickin' the tommy\nIt's time for me to write some shit for my mommy\nMy mother, and not only to tell her I love her\nBut to show her how the pen can cause her kid to grow up\nI don't even be lying no more.  Ma, I'm honest\nI'm not playing with guns no more neither, I promise\nI'm not hanging with the donnas\nHe my dog and I love him but fuckin' with son is just too much drama\nI wonder how it would be if you had the chance to raise me\nWould I still not know how to romance a lady?\nIs it \u2018cause you made me a cancer baby\nThat I stay on some crab shit so nobody get the chance to portray me?\nWhatever it is, yo, I ain't tryin' to let it go\nI'm focused ma\u2014I know what I'm headed for\nAnd, oh, before I let you go\nYou might not knew it before, so I'm telling you now to let you know\n\n[Hook]\nIf this world were mine\nI would place at your feet\nAll that I own\nYou've been so good to me\n\nFor real.  Every day, ma.  All that I own.  Ya know?  You been good, ya know?  Even when you couldn\u2019t be there, you was there.  You know what I mean.  You what\u2019m saying?  You what\u2019m saying?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI remember the everyday arguments\nPart of it was fuckin' with my common sense\nThe other part of it gave me the confidence\nTo do what I was doing\nOnly if I knew what I was doing\nWhen, what, and who was I pursuing\nBeing twelve years old, guzzlin' gold\nComing home drunk.  You crying while I stumble and fold\n\u2018Member you had your son like a bum in the cold\n\u2018Cause you was movin' my kicks and found jumbs in the sole?\nBut, man, I was a young man just runnin' the road\nTryin\u2019 to make a little crumbs \u2018cause wasn't none in my bowl\nI hated to see you struggle for gold\nWhen you really deserved ice, double the cold\nThat glow like your colorful soul\nMom, my love for you has wanted to grow\nLast ten times stronger than any couple that's old\nAnd, oh, before I let you go\nYou might not knew it before, so I'm telling you now to let you know\n\n[Hook x2]\nIf this world were mine\nI would place at your feet\nAll that I own\nYou've been so good to me\n\nEverything.  All that I own.  Ya know?  Shit it real, man.  I put my life on the line, son.  This rap shit ain\u2019t gassed up.  You know what\u2019m saying?\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, I said they could never give enough cheddar to me\nTo talk about the lady that made me negatively\nEven though eye to eye\u2019s something we never could see\nMy mother's the one woman no other one ever could be\nSee?  She gon' be proud when I blow like Nagasaki\nDon't ever regret lettin' them cell blocks adopt me\nJail was a blessin', mommy.  My nation stood by me\nThey got me in places regular faces can't find me\nAnd Omega, my crimey (what he say?), told me I'm so ahead of my time\nEven when they fast forward, niggas rewind me\nI learned about Malcom, Marcus, and Kwame\nAbout the white man\u2014why he feed us spiced ham\nSpam, and salami.  Lyrically they can't deny me\nAll I need is your love, your trust and just for you to stand by me\nAnd, oh, yo before I let you go\nYou might not knew it before so I'm telling you now to let you know\n\n[Hook]\nIf this world were mine\nI would place at your feet\nAll that I own\nYou've been so good to me\n\nEvery day.  All that I own.  Ya know?  This song is for all the mothers in the world.  Everybody\u2019s mother.  The deceased mothers.  Rest in peace, mothers\n\nYeah, that\u2019s real shit, man.  Real talk, man.  I love you, ma.  Word up.  For everything, yo.  Let\u2019s get back into some street shit", "album": "The Best of Saigon A.K.A. The Yardfather Vol. 1"}], "artist": "Saigon"}
