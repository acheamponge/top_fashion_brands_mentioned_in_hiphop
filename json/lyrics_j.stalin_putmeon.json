Bitch, where it's at?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd if I play my cards right\nTonight, would you put me on?\nPut, put me on?\nPut, put me on?\nIf I play my cards right\nTonight, would you put me on?\nPut, put me on?\nLet me take you home\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm off one upper and a few downers\nI'm a Cypress Village Oak-Towner\nI slide through with my trunk poundin'\nMy candy wet and these bitches drownin'\nSaid you been lookin' for me and don't want nobody else\nSaid lately you been lonely, in need of something fresh\nJust answer when I call and meet me in the West\nMeet me in the West, meet me in the West\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd if I play my cards right\nTonight, would you put me on?\nPut, put me on?\nPut, put me on?\nIf I play my cards right\nTonight, would you put me on?\nPut, put me on?\nLet me take you home\n\n[Outro]\nLet me take you home, let me take you home\nLet me take you home, let me take you home\nLet me take you home, let me take you home\nLet me take you home, let me take you home"}], "artist": "J.
