Come on\nLight that ass on fire\nDo you wanna get dirty, girl? Let's go\n\n[Bridge]\nGirl the world's watchin'\nFrom sunset to moonrise\nThey're tryna catch a glimpse (intimacy)\nOf you and I\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't know, what's come over me\nMy momma didn't raise me that way\nYou lit a fire, from inside of me\nThat'd light your seat ablaze, girl (that would leave those panties in flame)\nLight that ass on fire\n\n[Chorus]\nI could be the guy to treat you\nTo a nice movie, feed you\nBut I don't wanna mislead you\nTonight I think I wanna be dirty, girl\nDo you wanna get dirty, girl?
