I can get it for you\nGet it for you\nYou don't want me, do you?\nYou don't want me, do you?\nKnow what I'll do to you\n\n[Chorus: Yung Lean]\nI love how she dancing, got me feeling for you\nYou say that you love me, I don't know if it's true\nWhen I go to sleep all I ever see is you\nI can be your savior, everything that we've been through\nI love how she dancing, got me feeling for you\nYou say that you love me, I don't know if it's true\nWhen I go to sleep all I ever see is you\nI can be your savior, everything that we've been through", "title": "Hennessy & Sailor Moon"}]}
