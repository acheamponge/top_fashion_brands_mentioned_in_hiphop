Now a nigga on\nAnd the DJ playing my song\nAnd she wanna drink a little Dom Perignon\nWith Sean!\n\nI pray that it ain't temporary\nI've seen it in my dreams though\nMr. Visionary and I told them what it is though\nMr. Dictionary - they fuckin regular, I call em\nMissionary like\n\n[Hook]\nAww! Can't wait til I get back home\nAnd I'mma put all my niggas on\nAnd we gonna be the ones on TV, everybody\nGonna see me, you'll see man, Aww!\nCan't wait til I get back home\nAnd I'mma put all my niggas on\n\n[Verse 2]\nI walk up in this bitch like\nDo I need an introduction?\nWhen you living out your dreams\nSleep's an interruption. Man, I made\nIt out the city of corruption\nWith no concussion or a toolie tucked in\nYeah, we paid or we laid, no\nMinimum wages. Yeah, what else can I say?\nWe ain't no bed or a lie but we made up\nWhile they was all sleeping and laid up we stayed up\nWith drapes up like, Aww!\nAnd I'mma be home soon as I get the crown and throne\nAnd the name across it is my own\nWho would've known that we'd be paid off\nThis musical grind. Unusual I, me\nAnd my beautiful mind, that's why my niggas\nHigh-class like a school in the sky. I spit\nThe heat, you might see a mirage but no facade\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
