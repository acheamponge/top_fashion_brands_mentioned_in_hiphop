{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Afu-Ra]\nRap stack, spectacular, with the venacular\nStealth from a killing spree, they call be Blacula\nStep back, get ya neck fractured by the rapture\nGet choked out to the beat, by the manufucturer\nAnd I ain't here to laugh at ya, I'm just here to mash\nLike potatoes, flush ya fucking flow down the drain yo\nLet's get it on, let's get it gully, get it ugly\nEast New York nigga, we get it muddy, feel this\nI'm hittin' with sound, with the sound of a tre pound\nThat knock niggas down, then run clowns outta town\nMy malls taller than skyscrapers, you catchin' the vapors\nYou only got a pair of jacks, I got a pair of aces\nAs a matter of fact, I left a pool of bb's on ya girl's face, kid\nSlap the taste out ya mouth, from the Boogie Down\nTo the southern most tempted down south\nThere's six million ways to kill a pussy, wanna count?\n\n[Hook 2X: Afu-Ra]\nI never fake no moves, I just my thing\n(Do my thing, now watch me, do my thing, now)\n\n[Afu-Ra]\nWhen I step up in the studio, rollin' dolo\nWith the bolo, mandingo, stunnin' mojo\nQue paso? I be the sharpest capolo\nI ride over the ruggedest tracks, stack a Tahoe\nMaybe a Bronco, or even a Durango\nI MC for life, that's right, I do my thing, yo\nBang bang, yo, back 'em on the chain gang\nYo, I wanna spit it for my people, so I can let 'em know\nI never ripped it, to show off that I'm nicest\nMy instinct, is insinc, plus it's timeless\nAnd the light I shine, dog, is ultraviolet\nA night catch a sun tan, man, where my rhyme hits\nMy soul glow is unstoppable, unrockable\nI'm light weight, but I can put you in the hospital\nHittin' up the collective, or individuals\nI'm like an eighth covered in crystal, I'm gonna hit you\n\n[Hook 4X]\n\n[Afu-Ra]\nSo I'm the shit, huh? Now I'm Down like a Black Hawk\nEverywhere I go, like I'm walking on the catwalk\nI wax it, and tax it, I'm doing the kung fu kick\nHolding my dick, like Michael Jackson\nYowser yowser yowser, the more you can bounce to count\nThat everybody feel the power, you know?\nI step on the stage, my mic like a lightsaber\nBlast through the Seran Vega, then I jump off the wall\nAs I take it to your face, like Vega\nNow who wanna contest the champion sound?\nWith the crown from the underground, ready to fuckin' put it down\nParallel or perpendicular, you couldn't get with the\nLyrical elixir, I be the victor\nBeyond, and bless the mic so glorious\nAnd go 'head and dust off your rust\nI leave you stiff as a statue, boy, standing in the dust\n\n[Hook to fade]", "title": "Sucka Free", "album": "State of the Arts", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6641519bda508e451130d48bde3b5fe7.480x483x1.gif", "year": "2005-07-01"}], "artist": "Afu-Ra"}
