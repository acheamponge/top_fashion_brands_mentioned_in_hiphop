Y\u2019all niggas is slow\nI\u2019m pitching this no hitter. No nigga paint pictures with this fly repetition;\nDon\u2019t I paint the perfect picture like it\u2019s high definition?\nI\u2019m too Jurassic, future classic, class-act, Louie backpack - do the math\nBitch, don\u2019t make me black \u2018cause it\u2019s ugly. I\u2019m back on my study\nLoosen up the snap backs, back to the skullies\nMake me flashback to the Lacs and the Cudi\u2019s\nDon\u2019t make me relax, and run laps around dummies\nRelapse, he\u2019s back, it\u2019s a wrap for you mummies\nWeak rappers, ease back to the background for me, trying to handle more biz\nSo I can get that Rolls(Rose) on them 23\u2019s - something like Amber on Wiz\nCrown ain\u2019t safe, so all you niggas screaming out you \"got next\"\nTell them I said now it ain\u2019t safe! I eat off rap, I eat rappers\nKeep snapping, so keep slacking, I\u2019m lap running and speed bagging\nHeavy bagging, body hooking and left jabbing\nMake you miscount an attack, then I step back in it\u2019s one hit, two hit\nThree, hit you four like a one dick, two chick, threesome these whores\nOne watch, two chains like a three degree breeze\nI\u2019m the one air like the 23\u2019s on my sneakers!\nIt's a lot of Big K.R.I.T.(c)'s every time the kid blink, another comment\nTalkin the Kid\u2019s Ink. Fuck y\u2019all think? I get the job done\nI ain\u2019t make XXL but they can\u2019t God(guard) son, it\u2019s game time, y\u2019all pretending to ball\nI got a flow that school boys, no Kendrick Lamar. Oh, let me stop it\nI\u2019m just killing every topic. I ain\u2019t dissing, I ain\u2019t bitching if a nigga dissing me\nI don\u2019t know \u2018cause I ain\u2019t listen, I ain\u2019t missing, I ain\u2019t missing\nI\u2019m the nigga with a mission, got a plan and a vision\nI want the crown, you don\u2019t understand that? Fuck it, I want the ground\nNiggas run around blocks, I run the town\nI don\u2019t chase a dream nigga, I hunt it down and never close an eyelid\nNever met Los, you never known fly shit, but try this on;\nSee how its fitting you could never be number two so see, I ain\u2019t shitting\nYou could only be number one and I see why it\u2019s pissing you... off\nSoft niggas lack the backbone and the heart, you don\u2019t even act grown in your thoughts\nIn this movie the nigga that act wrong get the part(Depart), hope we can take two\nNo \"Drama Queen\", you'll get director cut, I don\u2019t mean behind the scenes\nI\u2019ve been doing this shit since Francis and Yao Ming, 80\u2019s baby, fly on the low life\nTracy McGrady\u2019s eye on the low, when I had gold teeth and I was high on the 'dro\nAnd my big homie had a whole pie on the stove. Had my eye on the goal\nHog tie on the floor and even when I ain\u2019t drive, I walk fly on a ho, Los!"}]}
