Look, no teeth\nIn his mouth cos he doubted the bro\u2019s teep\nThat\u2019s a front kick\nFor you dumb shits\nThat don\u2019t know we throw flows and punches\nWhere you livin at, munchkin?\nYou don\u2019t know that Akalas been munchin?\nEmcees like Saltfish, Dumpling\nOr better yet like free school lunches\nSo full of shit that I shouldn\u2019t even touch him\nBut I do cos I\u2019m just that hungry\nRavenous, valorous, abracadabrous\nAmateur emcees get dead in front of cameras\nScratch that we\u2019re takin\u2019 any challengers\nWhatever caliber can't match my stamina\nLook king you ain't on this ting like him\nYou never grew up on Sting\nYour guard's weak and there\u2019s holes in your chin\nWhile I\u2019m cold with the flow, John Jones in the ring\nYou're like Man that go gym, but never do squats\nFoundation\u2019s weak so you\u2019re easily dropped\nWhile I\u2019ve got more bodies than a Chinese cemetery\nDone duppied a million men with the pen already\nClaim that you\u2019re on dis ting, ya never ready\nDidn't your mum tell you lies ain't necessary?\nAnd Uncle Akala will punish you for lying\nKid Leviathan, I have been\nYou\u2019re sweet as a hyacinth\nKnowledge is Power Volume 2\nNext year again we will see who\u2019s who", "year": "2014-11-24", "album": "Sixteen 16's", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d63d64df777a3ef536fe94251e324962.1000x563x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
