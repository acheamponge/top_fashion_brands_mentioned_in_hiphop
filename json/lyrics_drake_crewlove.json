Cause\n\n[Chorus: The Weeknd]\nThey loving the crew\nThey loving the crew\nThey loving this crew\nOh, they loving the crew\nOh, they loving the crew\nThey loving this crew\nThey loving the crew\nThey loving the crew\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nYeah\nSmoking weed under star projectors\nI guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us\nBut seeing my family have it all\nTook the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall\nAnd really, I think I like who I'm becoming\nThere's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing\nThere's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation\nFor all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces\nAll it took was patience\nI got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me\nThe same ones that'll come up off the hip for me\nThe realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me\nI told my story, and made history\nTell them I'ma need reservations for 20\nI've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah\nMuch rather spend it all while I'm breathing\nThat OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know\n\n[Chorus: The Weeknd]\nThey loving the crew\nOh, they loving the crew\nOh, they loving the crew\nLoving the crew, ohh\nOh, They loving the crew\nThey loving the crew\nThey loving the crew\nThey loving the crew\nWhoa\n\n[Outro: The Weeknd]\nCause we blowing like a C4\nGot my whole crew blowing like a C4\n(If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city)"}]}
