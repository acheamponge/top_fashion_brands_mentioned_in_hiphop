talk\nI said shut up and let me talk\n\nI'm better than whoever motherfucker\nBetter than whatever motherfucker\nBetter than a better motherfucker\nThat was better motherfucker\nYeah I'm better than whoever\nWhen I step up in this motherfucker\n\nThis right here on behalf of the haters\nI don't give a fuck cause my act is the greatest\nI put my foot into the ass of the greatest\nAnd shred they ass like they passed through a grater\n\nI pinch my teeth\nI'm trying to hold back a mental beast\nStraight jacket on my tongue\nBrain in the facility\nI'm like the motherfucking stinger of a killer bee\nAll about my benjies, legs of a centipede\nI'm sorry but I body every track\nMake 'em stop and hold they breath like cardiac arrest\nI slaughter 'em to death, I kill them fucking bitches\nThere's a lot of girls out there, a sea of fucking fishes\n\nWordsmith, I ain't never gotta try hard\nBe good to they ass like I are\nMy track record is a killer for a pop star\nMy AKA is \"the best by far\"\n\nMy life is a job, trying to stop me is an occupation\nBeat 'em to a pulp, O.J., concentration\nNever win if I'm who you trying to beat\nSwear it'll be a blowout, like the sigh of relief\n\nI kill niggas\nGone from the bottom of the dirt I be big real, niggas\nBit off the chain then I beat 'em with a whip\n'till I turn these hoes to feel, niggas\n\nI swear to god you never get up on my level ho\nTell 'em kiss my ass and call it mono from a stereo\n\nCame up from the bottom like a back with a hump\nAlways been the realest in the last of the bunch\nOver everything like Shaq when he jump\nChew these little niggas like sticks of gum\nEat em with my mouth, straight Captain Crunch\nIf they don't say shit, ma ma ma\n\nVerbally destructed, I'm spitting like it's a whirlwind\nOutside of my box, I'm fitting to put the world in\nYou do not add up, don't think you can do the math, stupid\nWe are not the same, equal sign with a slash through it\nWalk up in this spot, the hoes scream till they throat is gone\nLike I'm not human, like I got two extra chromosomes\nPull up in that new shit, they get they Ford Focus on\nAll these kids follow me, I get my hocus pocus on\nDon't know what to call me, super fucking dope or something\nI'm killing them niggas, I must be the shit they choking on\nIf they copy a style, I must be the one that they quoting from\n\nNestle bar flow, I get nutty when it's crunch time\nEat the best of everything like cutting in the lunch line\nBeater ass bitches know, they don't want the beef or nothing\nPull they eyes out they sockets, they don't gotta see me stunting\nWhole fucking wolf, I ain't posing like I'm a sheep or nothing\nHanging outside of their door, like a wreath or something\nYou bust shots, I got an army brigade\nThat put the heat to niggas chests like LeBron and Dwayne\nNiggas call me Haze Horus, there is only one eye\nGetting closer to them pussies like the top of the tie\nSpit from the bottom of shoes, it's entirely soul\nAnd bitch, I'm about to blow like \"fire in the hole!\"\n\nWhy don't they get it, I won't stop till I'm finished\nSaid I will not fucking stop till I'm finished\nI'm better than holding and won't you admit it\nI'm over the bill like the top of the fitted\nGet the fuck out, I'm don't stop I'm not quitting\nI'll murder this shit, have a job then let's quit it\n\nMind state overgrown, Scarface in the corporate zone\nPut them in the batcave, I eat them till they're carbon bones\nNobody is fucking with me like I'm in the world alone\nAin't nobody like me, Facebook is dead and gone\nFucking neck-breaker, make 'em turn until they head is gone\nThey worry 'bout them Edward Cullen, son they may be dead at dawn\nY'all niggas can't fuck with me, I'm a fucking monster\nI'm a shot of Hitler, Guevara, mixed with some Josef Stalin\nMy girl come from America but she look like islands\nMy dude look like Tyga, but he think like Common\n\nHave you not got the time, motherfucker stop playing\nMoney on my mind like it sits on my brain\nYou will lose so be on my team\nIf it hurts to be sick, I ignore my pain\n\nNow tell 'em who be killing shit, I'mma get a copyright\nI'm so fucking good, I'd probably win in a cocky fight\nYou niggas can't copy right, you forgot to credit me\nYou niggas ain't picture perfect, you don't got no editing\nThey speak it and they let it be, yeah that's right they let it be\nThe line at the top is long, like the letter D\nYou fuck with my money, I murder your mummy\nAnd then I throw the twos up like the top of a bunny\nGot the fucking world jumping like the drop of a bungie\nThen I snap and kill niggas, Crocodile Dundee\nNobody is scaring me, I'm the fucking monster coming\nAfter niggas running like a motherfucking comma\nShit ain't pretty when I spit it but it's better than you ever looked\nGiant to these bitches, six foot seven foot", "year": null}]}
