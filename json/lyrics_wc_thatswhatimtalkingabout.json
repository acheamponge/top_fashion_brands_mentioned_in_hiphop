Still sold a shitload of records no radio or TV\nAnd I'm sticking to the program\nChucks on the concrete while the Cadillac door slams\nThe \"W\" was my star symbol\nMy jams make niggas get down, Like barrels outha car windows\nI'm a nut for Cheese and Chuck T's\nAddicted to big butt cheeks and weaves\nNot a pop artist but I'll pop ?they heezee?\nA branch of the same tree as Pac and Eazy\nBumpin Jam Master Jay & Biggie\nIron on the stove shakin up the starch can sprayin my Dickies\n\n[Hook X2]\nNow lemme see your fingers in the sky\nAnd if you like money keep em' up high\nStand up put your hands up show me what you all about\nReal shit nigga, yeah that's what I'm talking about\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nNow who that nigga quick to shoot it\nCap the truest\nThe closest to the streets to do it... Me\nThe D Fisher in this rap shit I'm a vet\n?And a blue fo' five tied around the neezeck.?\nYour future daddy I might be\nYou ain't never been with a nigga like me\nBaby slide me you number I'll call you later this weekend\nI can't talk now I'm on my way to rob the weed man\nLoved by a few hated by majority\nI'm the reason these rappers keep security\nI go hard kick gears and jump cars\nChuckin up the hood three wheelin in your front yard\nYou niggas is temporary, Facebook gangstas\nI put faces on obituaries nigga\nDub Cuda the bandana dangler\nO.T. countin' dirty money with the hanky up\n\n[Hook X2]\n\nNow lemme see your fingers in the sky\nAnd if you like money keep em' up high\nStand up put your hands up show me what you all about\nReal shit nigga, yeah that's what I'm talking about\n\n[Outro]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/776bb40462908854239af48b4db3c1b5.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "Revenge of the Barracuda", "title": "That\u2019s What I\u2019m Talking About"}]}
