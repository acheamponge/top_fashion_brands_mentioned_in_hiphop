You scared?\n\n[Verse 1: Young Chris]\nCalifornia weed, California weather\nRidin' in Miami back in Philly where I met her\nMy other bitch couldn't get it together\nShe couldn't get it together\nI thought I could never, find a cookie much better\nBut her ass way fatter and that pussy much wetter\nAnd she treat a nigga way better, treat a nigga way better\nFace in the shower, rain baby rain\nLove the sounds of your moan, legs shake as she came\nI wanna hear my name, I do it till you drained\nLong as you stay the same and don't do it to the gang\nYou'll be good girl, play ya part love\nWe'll build a bonnet they could never break apart love\nTurn the lights on, no in the dark love\nNo playin' mind games, just let your heart love\nDamn you cold\n\n[Chorus: Slim]\nIt's hard for me to find words and thighs\nBut when your next to me it feel come to mind\nBaby I, I think, I seen't ya\nAnd I see my future\nWe can go so far just from right here\nSo I'm hopin' that your not scared\n\n[Verse 2: Young Chris]\nShe say he never there and all she want is love\nMommy a sex fiend and I can be your drug\nShe don't wanna get caught up\nPrayers never brought up\nBut that ain't my intentions I ain't hear to mess the fort up\nI'm just trying to show you better places to go to\nI'm talkin' global, he too local\nBreak from the campus come and stay at the Atlantis\nTake your chances take advantage\nKing size wet sheets, sex on the best beach\nSweet tooth ya sex sweet\nFuckin you till next week\nWildin' Thomas Crown, we naked on an island\nHer pussy smilin' as bright as my medallion\nHoe what a night, now she call her girls up\nRight after I roll one, her time to twirl up\nIntroduce you to some shit that fuck ya world up\nYou haters let ya love down them players pick ya girl up\nCome on niggas\n\n[Chorus: Slim]\nIt's hard for me to find words and thighs\nBut when your next to me it feel come to mind\nBaby I, I think, I seen't ya\nAnd I see my future\nWe can go so far just from right here\nSo I'm hopin' that your not scared", "album": "The Network 5", "year": "2018-08-24", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c33701094836b990c18a2597c873c153.750x750x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young Chris"}
