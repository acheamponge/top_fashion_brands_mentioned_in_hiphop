Where were you on the night of the crime?, yeah, now the finger's pointing at you, now you're nervous, not sure what to do, and that's why you blame me, cause your ashamed of yourself and it's a shame to see, we all fall far from grace, praying that God won't recognize our face, the wages of sin is death, God already knows, snitch, hold your breath", "year": null, "album": "The IV Edition"}], "artist": "Braille"}
