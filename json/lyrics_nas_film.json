Caprese salad\u2019s on beaches and islands\nFar from police sirens at least for a weekend\nThen it's back to the streets creepin\nI'd like to make a free toast of champagne on behalf of this nigga speaking\nAdd a splash to the Seagrams\nRoll the hash for my world renowned goons this evening\nAs I circle the table like Babe Ruth\nLouisville Slugger in my grip for a fake dude\nBat to the brain with brute force\nSplatter my cream velour suit\nThey hit me with lawsuit\nI slip in your whore coupe\nYour bitch hate you, word to Jesus\nBet you never knew she toot yay and play with a gay crew\nOGs hate to make way for the new\nYoung niggas want Polo ain't fucking with J Crew\nIt's safe to say I was once young and innocent\nBut look what I know now, is all worth mentioning\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nI speak to the street life\nThe executive chief types\nThe felons, young mothers with kids they trying to feed right\nThe botega wearers modern day Che Guevaras\nCuz I barely survived crazy eras\nHonest, always make good on my promise\nI don't talk it I do it you can hold me to it\nI was born to this life I didn't invent it\nBut I'd be wrong not to take a few meal tickets\nYou and I are real different, we don't share the same beliefs\nFight in the ring or buy ringside seats\nEither you like beef, or you like to spectate\nGive me gloves, and I'mma do it how the refs say\nWe touch em and we come out tussling\nThe ghetto is my garden of eden\nSo I keep bobbin' and weavin'\nIt's intense so I'm hardly breathing\nKO, and the winner is Nas, that's how the scene ends\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Nas"}
