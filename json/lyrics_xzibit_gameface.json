Times motherfuckers keepin the pace\nNo need to pull strings things still get done\nTo have you yellin at the top of yo lungs\nSo Xzibit never speak wit a false tounge\nSlid off like a handgun\nTryin to build an empire to pass to my grandson\nI never like to talk business over the phone\nSo either have love for the game or leave it alone\nPlus action speak louder than words\nAnd pussy move faster than birds\nSo I gotta keep a gameface\nOn the street you slip, and you might catch a hot one\nXzibit stay low and kick back like a shotgun\nI keep it bangin to the end of the line\nWhen a rapper think his saggin style is fuckin with mine, it's divine\nCuz my family is harder than bricks\nAnything to keep it movin cuz it's harder to hit\n\n[Chorus]\n(Ras Kass)\nOnly right I fuck wit  you when you fuckin' wit mine\nKeep it movin to the end of the line\nAnd action speak louder than words\nAnd pussy move faster than birds\nGotta keep a gameface\n(Xzibit)\nOnly right I fuck wit  you when you fuckin' wit mine\nKeep it movin to the end of the line\nAnd action speak louder than words\nAnd pussy move faster than birds\nGotta keep a gameface\n\n[Verse 2: Ras Kass]\nMen must be either pampered or crushed\nTo regulate, relegate, delegate power, nigga touch something\nTrust no one and die dumping\nDrained ya battery you barely talking like Teddy Ruxpin\nSee that's wassup, nigga I don't give a fuck\nSay some shit so nasty, it'll make Little Kim blush\nAs if, a 98 bentley didn't tempt me\nTo lay bullshit over this MP\nBut consequently my conscience wouldn't permit me\nI'm one-third black man, one-third Jackie Chan\nOne-third sand, shiftin across the surface of the land\nGolden State Warrior let my nuts hang like niggas in nooses\nWhile you givin groupies all your loochie\nI'm known for fucking hoochies in suzukis\nAnd known for slippin bourgeois bitches roofies\nLoved and feared, severe yet loved\nThe full time titan fighting three million over night thugs\nSo keep your, hand out your rectum cause you can't stop shit\nDon't rock shit, studio hustlers\nClaimin' they got more keys than a locksmith\nWhat part of the game is this\nBonus Round, give me the mic, the money\nThe pussy in that order, the more, the over-populated\nGet fucked and orally copulated\nAnd all you chumps on some you owe me an apology shit\nCan suck yo apology out my dick\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\n(Ras Kass)\nThis is for the black niggas, the yak sippers\nThe part time strippers,slash full time student,and fifty buck slippers\nI got athletes feet,we run these contrete streets\nSporting cleats, ain't nothing sweet\n\n(Xzibit)\nI'm making rappers get they shit together\nStill smokin, still drinkin, still maintain clear thinkin\nEveryday is the weekend, mashin thru in a lincoln\nAnd style so sick, the whole car start stinking\n\n[Chorus]"}], "artist": "Xzibit"}
