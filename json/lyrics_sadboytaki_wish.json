I do it for them\nI want to make a wish, I want to ask you ...\n\nHoney, come with me to sing, let us sleep, I would do it for you\nYou know, there are thousands of ways to tell you that I love you\nI'm going to say it as many times as necessary, you know\n\nI know this is real, I am very different from others\nAt least that's what you say, I do not want to be different\nI want to be like I want, I want to be like that, I love you", "album": "Ghost"}], "artist": "SadBoyTaki"}
