collar popped\nI just pop the hood Louis luggage living good\nMy goons pop off act blind like Suge\nAnd i got a good lawyer he be lying real good\nAnd I still keep the iron when I'm riding in my hood\nLot of snitches lot of spy's, Like CBS gotta keep an open eye\nJay-Z impressed the shit out of me when i listened to his rhymes\nThat's when i was baggin reggie, made a killin of the dimes\nHad the Gucci and the Louis up in high school living fine\nBaggin bitches passing bitches I was always on the grind\nAin't that some shit, Still ain't gettin paid for this rapping shit\nSo i trap a lot and i rap a bit, but if i get locked i spit half of it\nI'm the fuckin man yeah they know me in Philly on my first mixtape had to throw on Gillie, Independent on the track, independent's feeling that\nAnd i probably bag your girl when i finish giver back\n\n[Hook: Derrick Diesel]\nCa-ca-ca-can't do it like me, can't do it like me\nThat's ya man, in the long white tee\nCan't do it like
