Edgar Hoover politicians dress up in drag\nTry to confuse you, makin' it hard to follow this:\nCapitalism and democracy are not synonymous\nYou swallow propaganda like a birth control pill\nSellin' your soul to the eye on the back of the dollar bill\nBut that will never be me 'cause I'm leavin' the past\nLike an abused wife with the kids, leavin' your ass\nLike a drug addict clean and sober, leavin' the stash\nUnbreakable Technique, leavin' the plane crash\nI'm out with the black box and I refuse to return\nI spit reality instead of what you usually learn\nAnd I refuse to be concerned with condescendin' advice\n'Cause I'm the only motherfucker that could change my life\n\n[Outro]\nSome people think I won't make it, but I know that I will\nEscape the emptiness 'cause that shit is slow and it kills\nThe flow and the skill, I made y'all believe that it last\nYou can make the future, but it starts with leavin' the past", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c628c98f9d53f039b060e7f0369c15b4.220x220x1.jpg", "album": "Revolutionary Vol. 2", "year": "2003-11-18"}]}
