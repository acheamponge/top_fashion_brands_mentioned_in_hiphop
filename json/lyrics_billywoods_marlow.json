I call it \"Man in a Hole\", but it needn't be about a man in a hole. Somebody gets into trouble, gets out of it again\nAh, ha ha\n\n[Hook: billy woods]\nWorld gettin' warmer, we goin' the other way\nWorld gettin' warmer, we goin' the other way\nWorld gettin' warmer, we goin' the other way\n\n[Verse 1: billy woods]\nColors fade and bleed, a carousel in grey\nNew Years Day in Maine, week before work, you rang\nWonderin' the nerve it take to lay under lurchin' waves\nLeapin' and crazed, spittle sprayed\nThe preacher overstayed the pulpit\nWe shoulda stayed a caged wailin' at the sepulchre\nThe hunted draws vultures, a sea of mea culpas\nTidal-ed out the culture, crawled inside\nSkin walkin', they cast me out the tribe\nYou caught the freedom party, I caught a vibe\nAmidst the revelry, Black Orpheus caught [?]\nThey killed it just to see it die\nDon't believe they lies\n[?] naggin' pain in my side\nLaugh in yiddish, thinkin' get ya English\nGrimace, hunchbacked to the canvas Gregor Samsa in the bed\nFamily's wishin' this ugly business was finished\nBut you laughin' instead, you got plenty of meds\nYou orderin' movies with the spiney legs splayed, antennas spread Blind eyes twistin' out ya head\nAnd the smell of rotten apples\n\n[Hook: billy woods]\nWorld gettin' warmer, we goin' the other way\nWorld gettin' warmer, we goin' the other way\nWorld gettin' warmer, we goin' the other way"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
