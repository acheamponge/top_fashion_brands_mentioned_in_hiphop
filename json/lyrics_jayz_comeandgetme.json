Come and get me nigga\nI won't, part with this, come and get me nigga\nI worked, hard for this, come and get me nigga\nI got, shots to give, COME AND GET ME...\nCOME AND GET ME...\n\n[Verse 4]\nAyo yo, ayo yo\nIt's only fair that I warn ya, rap's my new hustle\nI'm treatin' it like the corner, fuck with me if you wanna\nMy game change but my mind-frame remains the same\nI gotta protect what's mine\nShit I started from nothin'; zero, zip\nI made my way hustlin', I don't owe niggas shit\nI'm paranoid now, so I keep the gun gripped\nCats I played skelly with? Niggas done flipped\nI keep a banger in the ankle, one in the hip\nTwo in the stash, one come up when I shift\nI keep one under the chair where I sit\nI even got a gun in the hair in the bun of my bitch\nAsk Biggs; every time he'd come to my crib\nHe'd find another gun that I hid\nI'm ready to make this one of the, hottest summer there is\nEveryday like a hundred-and-six... shit...\n\n[Chorus]\nI got, shots to give, come and get me nigga\nY'all wanna rob the kid?
