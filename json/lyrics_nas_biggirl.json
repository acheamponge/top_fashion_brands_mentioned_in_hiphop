girl now)\nFully grown with your hormones now\nGot your own home and you alone\nWanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out\n(No more daddy's little girl)\nYou a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul\nYou could be aborting the next Michael Jordan\nYour man don't wanna be around\n(You're a big girl now)\nShe's sexy, she got it, she ride it\nEvery nigga wanna be inside it, uhh\n(No more daddy's little girl)\nI need her, I'll eat her\nDo anything to please her\nMy ghetto queen of Sheba\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm the type that'll get you by the fireplace\nGet you hype when I lick it, put it by your face\nSipping red wine, is it bedtime\nYou can kick it with your nigga while we listen to Faith\nI'm feeling richer today,I can hit it then stay\nLingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play\nWe got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice\nBubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right\nIt's your night, no stress, no fight\nMad at your ex, 'cause his dough tight\nNever go right when you're with him\nTry your best to forget him\n'Cause it's easy to please me\nCD skip when your head board hit the wall\nCall for the lord\nRight when you cum, I'm biting your tongue\nMake your legs cramp up, you can't stand up\nYou can hit a blunt if you want\nI'ma pull my pants up\nWe can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust\nTell me what's the reason for us\nTo love or to fuck\nI'm the thug that you want\nIf it's gangster we can't front\nIf you want me I can stay around\nIf you need me, I'm here for you\nHow that sound?\nNow it's up to you\nDepending on how you wanna get down\n'Cause you're a big girl now\n\n[Chorus]\n(You're a big girl now)\nFully grown with your hormones now\nGot your own home and you alone\nWanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out\n(No more daddy's little girl)\nYou a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul\nYou could be aborting the next Michael Jordan\nYour man don't wanna be around\n(You're a big girl now)\nShe's sexy, she got it, she ride it\nEvery nigga wanna be inside it, uhh\n(No more daddy's little girl)\nI need her, I'll eat her\nDo anything to please her\nMy ghetto queen of Sheba\n\n[Verse 2]\nGot your name and your number in my cell phone\nHear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone\nIf you in a good mood, if you not\nOr you thinking bout you was at my spot\nWhat we did when we got hot\nIs you dreaming you had me?\nIs you creaming your panties?\nLike a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me\nOn the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink\nAnd we ate each other like candy\nUnder the covers, two intimate lovers\nYou fuck a nigga like you mad at me\nThrow the ass to me\nYou should be glad to be\nIn the presence of a real thug as bad as me\nWhile I'm in the streets with my murdering squad\nYou talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard\nHow I'm making my rod, how I make you say \"Oh God\"\nEvery ho that you know wanna know Nas\nGotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard\n'Cause you know how these girls are\nWearing tight shit, no panties, no bra\nRunning up to my car with menage a trois suggestions\nStarting to get an erection\nGuessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing\nComplexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave\nI need time to breathe\nWanna follow me, ironically\nYou pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe\nLike it's my fault\nBut you don't wanna talk\nDon't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden\nYou and the shorty start scuffing\nNow shorty dumping you out\nCan't let her get the best of you\nSo I rescue you\nOnly thing left to do was to grab her\nSo you can jab her, get a cheap shot\nYou don't wanna feel chumped\nNow here the cops come\nSo we gotta run to the ride\nThen we drive off through the traffic\nDon't panic, but you know how we gotta manage\nLooking at your face\nAnd the damage in your facial\nEvery angle can't let it faze you\nNo reason to be insecure or immature\nBaby girl, see the world is yours\n\n[Chorus]\n(You're a big girl now)\nFully grown with your hormones now\nGot your own home and you alone\nWanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out\n(No more daddy's little girl)\nYou a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul\nYou could be aborting the next Michael Jordan\nYour man don't wanna be around\n(You're a big girl now)\nShe's sexy, she got it, she ride it\nEvery nigga wanna be inside it, uhh\n(No more daddy's little girl)\nI need her, I'll eat her\nDo anything to please her\nMy ghetto queen of Sheba\n(You're a big girl now)\nFully grown with your hormones now\nGot your own home and you alone\nWanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out\n(No more daddy's little girl)\nYou a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul\nYou could be aborting the next Michael Jordan\nYour man don't wanna be around\n(You're a big girl now)\nShe's sexy, she got it, she ride it\nEvery nigga wanna be inside it, uhh\n(No more daddy's little girl)\nI need her, I'll eat her\nDo anything to please her\nMy ghetto queen of Sheba"}], "artist": "Nas"}
