I guess they on their menstruals\nI don\u2019t need no, come consider the general\nRegardless of my genre, yes, I\u2019m flawless, man, in general\nWhen I\u2019m in the club, girls be jigging on they tippy toes\nSo she take me in like her vitamins and minerals\nYou ain't on my signal, you analog or digital\nGrand Hustle champion, someone turn my anthem on\nWhen my jam come on, God damn I blow straight up\nI am a bomb\nLeaping over barriers like this was a triathlon\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nEvery other city we go\nEvery other city we go\nIt\u2019s just a different day with the same shit\nIt\u2019s just a different day with the same shit\nEvery other city we go\nEvery other city we go\nThings just ain't what I used to know\nThings just ain't what I used to know\n\n[Donnis - Verse 3]\nNow I\u2019m the everyday topic\nUnder a microscope so now I\u2019m feeling microscopic\nMy shit was fading to black, niggas thought I was gothic\nBut made it to the next step like recovering alcoholics\nI bounce back like a Snoop Deville with hydraulics\nAin't \"Nuthin' But A G Thang\", nigga I\u2019m the king of pain\nVeins filled with Novocaine, so I ain't even feeling y\u2019all\nI ain't even hearing y\u2019all, fingernails on a blackboard\nThey say the pen is way mightier than the sword\nSo I\u2019mma spaz out to get inside the mental ward\nThen get my Grammy awards\n'Til your faith is restored by the lord of this rap shit\nNiggas got it backwards, let's line up all the factors\nGrew up in the hood, but was raised in the 'burbs\nWhere pops wasn't there so the military made me a man\nAnd they told me to put my dreams in the can\nBut I still made it here, damn!\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nEvery other city we go\nEvery other city we go\nIt\u2019s just a different day with the same shit\nIt\u2019s just a different day with the same shit\nEvery other city we go\nEvery other city we go\nThings just ain't what I used to know\nThings just ain't what I used to know", "title": "Batman Flow", "album": "No Genre", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d18ebaef113d710715491da16422feee.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
