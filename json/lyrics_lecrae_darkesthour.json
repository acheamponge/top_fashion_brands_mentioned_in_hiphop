They both offer you life\n\n[Chorus: Lecrae]\nI fall on my knees when I rise\nThank him for my breath, opening my eyes\nWhen I leave my home, if I meet my demise\nEven the darkest day will see the sun rise\nI fall on my knees when I rise\nThank him for my breath, opening my eyes\nWhen I leave my home, if I meet my demise\nEven the darkest day will see the sun rise\n\n[Verse 2: Lecrae]\nCome as you are is what they told me, so I paid attention\nAnd I ain't wore a suit to church since Jordan was a Wizard\nFather forgive em they betrayed us with a kiss (mwah)\nHate what they can't understand, I'm so ambiguous\nI spazzed on the pharaoh, the pathway is narrow\nEye of the bull on my back, looking for an arrow\nLying like I wasn't tempted by that double barrel\nIf gangstas don't dance, why you tappin' with the devil?\nMy two left feet won't let me dance to his beat\nSick of livin' in Hell and I'm allergic to the heat (it's cold)\nAnd imperative you listen to my narrative\nThey sellin' false hope like a sedative\nI don't think the world is aware of it\nMaybe they don't care a bit\nThey think we all fam but it's relative\nTry to think my flow is irrelevant but they don't know a thing\nCrucify me next to thieves, I'm still gon' rise a king ('Crae)\n\n[Chorus: Lecrae]\nI fall on my knees when I rise\nThank him for my breath, opening my eyes\nWhen I leave my home, if I meet my demise\nEven the darkest day will see the sun rise\nI fall on my knees when I rise\nThank him for my breath, opening my eyes\nWhen I leave my home, if I meet my demise\nEven the darkest day will see the sun rise"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
