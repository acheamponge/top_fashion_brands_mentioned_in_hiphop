I ask a friend\nIf I can't we'll stay in, even sweats you look attractive in\nCook a meal at home, some yellow tail I pour a glass, pretend\nSmash all night then wake you up to smash again\nFelt like we could never do wrong, and you been down for too long\nThere's nothing to improve on, that's why I could never move on\nFrom clippin' out a coupon, from sleeping on a futon\nTo being driven in a presidential Lincoln or a Yukon\nAnd I know you always stay down for the cause\nYou love me even for the flaws\nBut don't do this shit for applause\nSoon as I get right then I'mma take care of you\nSwear I'm so prepared to love you\nKnow it's no one there above you\n\n[Hook]\nMy whole life has changed\nSince you came in, I knew back then\nYou were that special one\nI\u2019m so in love, so deep in love\nYou make my life complete\nYou are so sweet, no one competes\nGlad you came into my life\nYou blind me with your love, with you I have no sight\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, pick it up where I left you at\nNever want to go have to go get you back\nEnough hard times, yeah we went through that\nBig ol' house, I'mma get you that\nOverseas trips, baby let's do that\nLookin' at your face and I'm thinking' about the place where I met you at\nYeah, and since day one, you supported these dreams\nAlways stayed right by my side\nTrust, I notice these things\nEven way, way back\nWhen my buzz was dead like bee stings\nBroke as ever, when your vision's far it's tough to see things\nAnd whenever we ate out, we might split an entree\nBank account with $3k, that's no relation to Andre\nAnd that would be a hot day save for rain, that's what my moms say\nI think just putting cash away is what she was trying to convey\nCause money comes, money goes; People switch to funny roles\nAnyone would tell you that one good girl's worth twenty ho's\nSoon as I get right I'mma take care of you\nSwear I'm so prepared to love you\nKnow it's no one there above you\n\n[Hook]\nMy whole life has changed\nSince you came in, I knew back then\nYou were that special one\nI\u2019m so in love, so deep in love\nYou make my life complete\nYou are so sweet, no one competes\nGlad you came into my life\nYou blind me with your love, with you I have no sight"}]}
