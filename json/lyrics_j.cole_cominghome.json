Cole]\nBack where I belong\nI\u2019ve never felt so strong eh\nFeeling like there\u2019s nothing that I can\u2019t try\nAnd if you feel me put your hands high, high, high, hey\nAnd if you feel me put your hands high, high, hey\n\n[Verse 1: J. Cole]\nThis is my story this is my song\nIf you ain't got the heart, don\u2019t attempt to try this at home\nIt\u2019s just a poem from a man once living wrong\nNow I\u2019m in the zone, tell the World I\u2019m coming home\nBeen a long time coming, been a long time coming\nThis song feel like the greatest of all time coming\nCause I do it B-I-G, I remember we would be high\nWho\u2019d have thought we\u2019d be running rap when we was knee high\nTo appreciate the sun you gotta know what rain is\nOr cause I\u2019m famous you don\u2019t gotta know what pain is\nBut I bounce back, would ya look at that\nI take my spot at the top and I ain't looking back\n\n[Hook: Skylar Grey]\nI\u2019m coming home\nI\u2019m coming home\nTell the World I\u2019m coming home\nLet the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday\nI know my kingdom awaits and they\u2019ve forgiven my mistakes\nI\u2019m coming home, I\u2019m coming home\nTell the world I\u2019m coming\n\n[Verse 2: J. Cole]\nHey, confusion like I was losing my mind\nBut one thing I never lose is my grind\nMy closet need a lot of cleaning now\nI can\u2019t sleep cause I dont like the shit I dream about\nHey Dear Lord please help me get the demons out\nAnd then help me get my genius out\nAnd get back to what I had\nIf my good\u2019s outweigh my bads, do you think my mistakes is gon even out (even out)\nI guess try and see, it\u2019s on my diary, I\u2019m living for my kids\nNow they is just as fly as me\nTalk well, wonder if Andre Harrell knew how great I would be when he fired me\n\n[Hook: Skylar Grey]\nI\u2019m coming home\nI\u2019m coming home\nTell the World I\u2019m coming home\nLet the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday\nI know my kingdom awaits and they\u2019ve forgiven my mistakes\nI\u2019m coming home, I\u2019m coming home\nTell the world I\u2019m coming\nI\u2019m coming home\nI\u2019m coming home\nTell the World I\u2019m coming home\nLet the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday\nI know my kingdom awaits and they\u2019ve forgiven my mistakes\nI\u2019m coming home, I\u2019m coming home\nTell the world I\u2019m coming"}], "artist": "J.
