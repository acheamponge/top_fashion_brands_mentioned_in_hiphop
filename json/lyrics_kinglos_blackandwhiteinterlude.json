What you say now?\nGet down or fucking lay down\nMy whole world is black and white, black and white\nMy whole world is black and white, black and white\nWhat you say now? What you say now?\nThis whole world\u2019s your playground\nWhat you say now? What you say now?\nGet down or fucking lay down"}]}
