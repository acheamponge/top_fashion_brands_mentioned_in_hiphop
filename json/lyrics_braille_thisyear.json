It's all about this year right here (x4)\nIll flavor in ya ear wit a message!\n\nThis is the Bay ta test for the main event\nI speak from the soul, my skintone is irrelevant\nCanada to Germany, LA to the East\nI did shows in Japan, I'm a travelin man like MosDef\nI got ten-thousand of Yen\n8 bucks, 5 Euro, keep it live in ya borough or project\nI'm on a mission with ambition\nBringin transmission to spiritual transmission\nSpread throught the airwaves like a air-raid\nDroppin concepts never heard on the airplay\nAnd airborne evolution's takin place\nIt all starts with you, Mic check 1, 2\nWhere you at, huh!?!", "year": null, "album": "Box of Rhymes"}], "artist": "Braille"}
