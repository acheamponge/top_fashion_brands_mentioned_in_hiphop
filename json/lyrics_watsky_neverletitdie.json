If they say that your magic is black\nJust do what you do when you do what you do, keep on pulling that rabbit from hat\nYou might think that you're ruined. You might think you're defeated\nIf you love what you're doing you've already succeeded\nBut there's gonna be bleeding, when another one bites that dust\nSo get ready to beat it, cause it might be us, and I'm telling em\nThat the journey is oh so slow and we wanna say \u201cno no no\u201d\nCause to make it is difficult, but we go go go\nAnd my father was telling me that I better be ready ride on through\nCause I know that it's tough, but it's gotta be somebody, so then why not you?\n\n[Chorus]\nI\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die\nI\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die\nI\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die\nI\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die\n\n[Verse 2]\nCarry the spark as we're marching into the darkness\nI don't care if they're marking where they bury my carcass\nI'm working in this circus and searching for purpose\nLearning from the bird who's perched on top of the church and chirpin a sermon\nYou want that early worm? Be the determined sparrow\nFlying in loops around the sternest scarecrow\nOnce cupid hit me with his burning arrow\nHe lit the lava in my churning marrow\nSo when I'm tested I remember I've been blessed\nWith that tender ember resting left of center in my chest\nAnd yes, if you fuck with us you'll see my game face\nCause no matter who you pray to when you say grace\nAnd no matter where you come from in this great space\nEvery single person is escaping from the same place\nSo if you got a flame that's blazing hot within\nTake a deep breath and feed it oxygen\n\n[Chorus]\nI\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die\nI\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die\nI\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die\nI\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die\n\n[Interlude - Mom]\n\u2026So I was really interested and loved folk music, and then when I was in seventh grade, in the fall of 1963, I started getting interested in politics. This was about a year after my dad died, and I think it was a real way to connect with him\u2026 with my memories of him\u2026\n\n[Chorus]\nI\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die\nI\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die\nI\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die\nI\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die, I\u2019ll never let it die\n\n[Interlude - Poetry section]\nTore the pages from their Torahs, hurled torches at their doors\nSo they departed Polish ports and boarded boats to court the green lady with that copper torch who rose up gorgeous off the shore\nEndured that stormy weather for me\nEllis Island, hellish journey\nMaggots in the hard barley\nSome shot off their own toes so they couldn't be forced to march in the Tsar's army\nBodies pitched in ditches, singed and bludgeoned\nBurned the children in the ovens by the dozens\nBurned the witches in New England by the coven\nThey burn the different ones, so clutch your cousins close\nCause such is life, it's cuts and strife, and stitches, punches, knives and hungry crows\nNothing guarantees survival\nAnd we won\u2019t stop this terror sticking flowers in the barrels of their rifles\nWe fight the hatred with the light\nAnd when they think we'll fold and wave that bright rag\nWe won't surrender\nWe'll wipe the blood up with the white flag", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0199ac49c667975a2b0c5188cae549aa.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "All You Can Do", "title": "Never Let it Die"}]}
