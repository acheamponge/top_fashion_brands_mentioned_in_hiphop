Ring the alarm\nLet off the scram if a man wants arms\nIt might come as a shock\nBut I can't get raid and I can't get robbed\nCut through your block and your jewels get gone\nDon't care if you're bad, mean or strong\nKeep on tweeting, talking trash\nYou don't wanna see me pull round to your crib\nMan don't wanna war, man don't wanna clash\nMan's got big metal arms like Jax\nFlick out the blade like Sonya\nLeave a reptile six feet under\nSaid I wasn't really gonna get him till I got ya\nNow he's looking sick, a brudda better call a doctor\nYou don't want smoke, cuz, you're a wally\nMan like me will touch up a strolly\nShower man down, make him look like a brolly\nBut I don't wanna get cage like Johnny\nOT in the country\nMC Hammer, man can't touch me\nMan will get left on the floor in your blood, G\nMan's all pale when I flow like Kwanghee\nRun from the scene like Lennon\nNobody saw, who's gonna tell 'em?\nLittle things just like Sara, that's Bellum\nRifle and I'm all black like Heron\nPut a quick hole in his denim\nShooters active, don't let me bell 'em\nSwear I'll dead 'em, split man's melon\nStrap's off beat like Soulja Boy Tell 'Em\nI shoot speed off like mobiles on Lyca\nI ain't defensive, 'cause I'm the striker\nI'm from Grove but trust, I'm no biker\nArms like Goro, stripes like Tiger", "year": "2015-05-30", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/c1da1725f3674657bc28af32ebd6ad23.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "AJ Tracey"}
