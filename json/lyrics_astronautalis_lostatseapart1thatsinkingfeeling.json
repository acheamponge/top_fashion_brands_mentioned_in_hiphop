Gotta drown it out\nIt's just a little further baby gotta get what she needs... Gotta build it up\n(x2)\n\nThe famous waves escaping all my lame attempts to drag them in & ride to safety. Hate me. This is a coronation decorate me in your favorite, sinking, maybe, save me. Save me. Save me\n\nIt's just a little further baby gotta get what she wants... We're all lost at sea\nIt's just a little logic we're all crazy for it... My god the stars are falling in\nHe's just a little lazy we all have walked it lady... Slipped off and falling in\nIt's such a lovely evening baby wants to go for a walk... It's easy friend\n\n\"I don't think that they're gonna like this. How often am I gonna do this? Who makes songs about this crap? I don't think the album has enough rap songs, y'know? *sigh* When am I gonna get over this shit?\"", "year": "2006-05-23"}]}
