Shots bang out of clips\"\n\"Recognize the G\"\n\"Macs, tecs, which ones you like?\"\n\n[Blaq Poet]\nWhat, what, WHAT~?!\nPoet's unstoppable, rhyme style remarkable\nFlow like an AK, poppin you, droppin you\n{*gunfire sprays*} I'm known as the wildest\nI get it in, I'm the motherfuckin foulest\nWho wanna test? I leave a bloody mess\nAin't none of y'all niggas, built for my stress\nReady for war wearin Timbs and fatigues\nTakin no prisoners it's you versus me\n... I'm the hardest of the hardcore\nIt's God's law, I'm trained in the art of war\nHow many times I gotta say this shit?\nGotta remind y'all niggas, y'all forget quick\nI rep QB to the fullest\nGot the whole rap industry sweatin bullets\nYou know my motto was fuck the police\nFrom Queens Plaza to 59 Street\nTouch mine and it's problems\nSo many problems... a genius can't solve them!\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Reef the Lost Cauze]\nThe righteous will prosper, I'm higher than opera notes\nTote guns, spit fire like Mothra - don't\nEver look into the eye of a monster\nI'm not, tryna battle you I'm tryin to pop you\nYou dumb! I was tryin to stop you\nNow you dyin cause I hold the iron iron that shot you\nYo guns don't kill people, the soul of a man does\nLeave you faceless like the mascot for And1\nThrowback shit, hold that clip\nI just collect money chill, and roll that piff\nUntil you get the picture, like a Kodak strip\nThey call me raw dog Cauze, I'm on that Kojak shit\nTelly Saval' I'm ready for all, demolition\nHit 'em, until they ready to fall, hold my heat ready\nAim steady and all\nTake niggas back to school like every fall\nIt's the Cauze young boy...\n\n[Chorus]"}], "artist": "Blaq Poet"}
