You should roll up that Cali weed\nAnd play bust it wide open on the PS3 (Bust it wide open)\nGirl, you gotta be a freak to be fucking me\nAnd if you ain't, it ain't no point to fuck with me\nBend over, bust it open give me something to see\nI ain't your baby daddy don't be making love to me (I guess so)\nWhat the fuck you mean you guess so?\nI got my neck, she got my dick, let go\nShe got to sucking it but it was sensitive\nGoing crazy, I couldn't finish all my sentences\nI done nutted two times, this bitch was feeling Kidd\nPut on my Tru's and walked out so bro can get in\n\n[Hook:

Cashout bitch you know that I'm on\nLet me fucking keep it moving that's what tip I'm on\nTonight come on\nCause this might be your lucky one\nMy bitch left me so I guess I need another one\nFat ass,

killer pussy some get to murdering me\nI ain't got time for the small talk, baby take it all off\nMagnum's in my Tru's I don't go on hoes raw, dawg\nHell naw, not P\nEat the pussy , not me\nGood dick and Vans got me walking 'round cocky\nWhatever happen baby I'ma forget\nCause I'm off to much Liq' and now I got her ass bent\nShe said after that  'Pay I'm on all on your dick'\nJust answer when I call that 3 cause I'm on dat tip\n\n[Hook: Payroll Giovanni]\nI got Patron in my cup, kush in my blunt\nScrolling through my phone tryna see who I can fuck\nI'm on that tip, I'm on that tip, I'm on
