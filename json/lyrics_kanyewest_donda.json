I really appreciate the fake DW twitter page but since it\u2019s not official I can\u2019t co-sign any information on it\n\u201cSimplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\u201d \u2013 Leonardo Da Vinci\nMore clarity\u2026 I have no agency representing me currently\u2026 William Morris was fired after Cara Lewis quit. I love Cara Lewis :-)\nI love being back at my fashion office learning and creating. It\u2019s so challenging and fun and I\u2019m surrounded by amazing people. They say you only live once but every time I come to work I feel like I\u2019m starting a second life. You guys might think I have some type of backing for my line but I don\u2019t. I did the first fashion show out of my own pocket and used the money I made touring to follow my passion. I\u2019ve been working at this for 8 years now. From the first offers to do urban clothing lines that I turned down\u2026to begging Bape to do my line and never making any real headway\u2026to having an office in LA that was shut down after the \u201cMTV\u201d moment along with my tour with (Lady) Gaga\nI moved to Japan for one month after that and designed every night in my room. I had this opportunity to intern at Fendi and was also offered a position at Versace which I could not take due to my contract with LV which was for 2 years. I moved to Rome after I left Japan and worked at Fendi for 4 months undercover. I was there to give ideas for the men\u2019s collection. I snuck to Giuseppe Zanotti\u2019s factory still under contract and learned to design womens shoes for 2 years before my first show in Paris. After doing the first LV collection I was sure I would get a second shot to create but was never given the opportunity\nI designed a sneaker called the (Air) Yeezy with Nike. I\u2019m \u201callowed\u201d to design 1 pair of sneakers every 2 years. I have more ideas\u2026\nEarly 2011 I moved to Paris and opened a small design studio. The language barrier was quite difficult. I still don\u2019t have a Paris VAT number to this day. I don\u2019t know what a VAT is but every time I asked why we didn\u2019t have fabrics they said it was because of the VAT. In Paris I met many great people in design including the master Azzedine Alaia. Azzedine even came by my studio one day :-). This was the greatest feeling to stand in his presence in my embarrassingly small Paris studio in a courtyard opposite Collate\nI remember being 5 years old picking and my mother taking me with her shopping at the discount fur spots. She said I would always point to the most expensive furs, even as a child. LOL. There is something about making clothing that always brings me back to that point. For the first 16 or 17 years of my life the only thing I knew about women\u2019s clothing was what my Mom would wear. I guess some critics would joke that I still don\u2019t know anything. LOL. My Mom would wear blue jeans with a fur and an embellished \u201cCosby Show\u201d sweater :-) to pick me up from school. The teachers said I couldn\u2019t focus. I used to get kicked out of class for bringing dirty magazines and drawing Nike\u2019s in 4th grade\nBeing a celebrity has afforded me many opportunities but has also boxed me in creatively. I was just discussing becoming the creative director for the Jetson movie and someone on the call yelled out, \u201cyou should do a Jetsons tour!\u201d\nThis just happened a few hours ago. I was very insulted of course because for anyone that\u2019s seen the Watch the Throne Tour, Coachella, Glow in the Dark or Runaway know that I have real ideas\nI appreciate having the most nominations at the Grammy\u2019s but I feel so conflicted by the fact that award shows sometimes are completely illogical. Good logic tells me \u201csmile Kanye\u201d, the world likes you again. \u201cRed or blue pill?\u201d\u2026aaaaand Swallow. LOL. I wouldn\u2019t have the prestige I have if it wasn\u2019t partially for the Grammy's validation and I honor that\nHmmmmm, what to wear? Here I go again\u2026 Yeezy the trend setter or complete f*cking fashion victim\u2026the verdict is still out. This is just a train of thought but I figure it\u2019s better to read than trained thoughts\nWhat good is fame and prestige if you can\u2019t use it to help people? I want to help by doing what I know how to do best\u2026create\nI have started a new company and I\u2019m so excited about the name\u2026it\u2019s got the best name ever\u2026of all companies\u2026of all time!!!\nThe name of the company is DONDA\nDONDA is a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers and put them in a creative space to bounce there dreams and ideas. I used to blog all the time an fit was a way to get my opinion out. Dr Dre redesigned headphones and made more impact off of one product. I am assembling a team of architects, graphic designers, directors musicians, producers, A&Rs, writers, publicist, social media experts, app guys, managers, car designers, clothing designers, DJs, video game designers, publishers, tech guys, lawyers, bankers, nutritionists, doctors, scientists and teachers\nDONDA will be comprised of over 22 divisions with a goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford. I want to put creatives in a room together with like minds that are all way doper than me. We want to help simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see hear, touch, taste and feel. To dream of, create, advertise and produce products driven equally by emotional want and utilitarian need.. To marry our wants and needs\u2026DONDA\nThis will all take time but I wanted everyone\u2019s to know what I really care about\u2026I care about people\u2026I care about my fans\u2026I care about people who have never heard of me\u2026There are over 7 billion people on the planet now\u2026It\u2019s something about coming from music that makes me so optimistic. Music travels and is not limited to only the wealthy. Sometimes my grammar is wrong but my thinking is right :-). My mom was an English teacher so I know she sends an SMDH from heaven :-). 5:18 am in London, my dreams keep me woke\nThe Watch the Throne tour was a small example of what a DONDA experience can be\u2026\nI\u2019m currently working on a new 7 screen experience\u2026\n\nThis is one of our projects to be released this year called 2016 Olympics\u2026It\u2019s semi sci-fi, since 2016 is only 4 years away, :-)\nWe would also like to design the MTV awards. We\u2019re taking everything 10 steps at a time, LOL! I wanted to put this in the world, in hopes that the people who can actually make a difference will stand up and reach out. We need as many amazing powerful smart talented wealthy people to be involved. Come get on board\u2026don\u2019t just sit there\u2026reach out\nWe can collectively effect the world through design. We need to pick up where Steve Jobs left off\nWhen I said wealthy I wanted to point out there are so many billionaires in the world that can come together and help to redesign it and help education. School systems were designed to turn people into factory workers. Schools should be designed to prep human beings for real life\nSpike Jonze and I want to do a Summer school that tries new forms of curriculum. Math classes should teach addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, accounting and money management aaaaaand cut!!!\nUNLESS YOU\u2019RE A MATH MAJOR!!! Kids you should be able to take majors starting in grammar school like how it is at performing art schools. Instead of kicking kids out of schools for using their iPhones\u2026why not promote it?\nAllow kids to use search engines to do test\u2026like the real WORLD!!! Give kids the amount of test they would have in a year in one day but they have to get everything perfect\u2026please excuse my grammar\u2026I know it\u2019s extremely ironic\nSome kids have better memories than others\u2026what about emotional IQ\u2019s? What about kids who do bad in school because of how bad their surroundings are?\nExcuse me\u2026I just get excited at the possibilities\u2026the more excited I get the more grammatical errors you\u2019ll see\u2026\nWe need to take what Michael Jackson felt and Mcqueen and Steve Jobs, and we need make things better\nWhen me and Jay toured, every night I peered into the audience astonished by the different walks of life that came to support us\nThe adrenaline is running\u2026I don\u2019t know if I can even get to sleep now. From Wall Street to the London riots to Chicago murders\u2026I sit everyday and ask what can I do to make a difference. I know this is not a very rapper thing to say but I haven\u2019t bought a new car or piece of jewelry in about 2 years\nI invest every dime back into creativity, hiring amazing creatives, paying for flights, offices\u2026etc. My area of expertise is in music, my passion is in music, design, film and products\u2026my strength is connectivity\u2026\nThere are so many broken systems from the economy to school systems to jail systems\u2026we need experts for this. We need scientist and top world designers to directly affect governments\nI just wanted to share what\u2019s been on my mind\u2026\n\u201cIf you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple\u2026but if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.\u201d \u2013 George Bernard Shaw"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
