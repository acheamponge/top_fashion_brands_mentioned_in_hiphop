{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Intro]\nWe're so excited, we don't know what to do\nBecause we're about to reenter the level above humans\n\nI couldn't have had a better life than I've had in since 21 years\nAnd if it was good here, I know it is going to be good-twice as good when I get up there\n\nThis isn't a troubling circumstance, don't take it as that-it is just a gateway, just a drawing\n\nW-What we're doing is we're going home. We're going home to those individuals who sent us here to do this task, and this is the happiest and joyous thing that you can-\n\n[Aesop Rock]\nAlright\nRaised on dirty hot dog water and popcorn butter\nEPMD tellin' me every popstar a sucker\nDon't let him smell the potstickers, he'll stick around for supper\nHe'll stick around for cheesecake, then three days, then the summer\nWhere spiders eat their mothers, where rodents eat their young\nI'm not here to make sense where there is none, that's dumb\nMy attitude is ghastly, any gallantry been going gone\nI think I'm probably a lot like dating Mola Ram, I should work on that\nThe geezer not a leader, I'm a loner\nLover, believer, upholder of the under\nJust not a people person, please forgive me if I'm flustered\nI'll save a thousand whales before your grits are even buttered\nMy name is Aesop Rock, I've been a mess for my entire life\nAll I know is fight or flight, what the fuck's a silent night?\nWho the fuck are you to tell me who the fuck you even are\nThis is more than band-aids over itsy-bitsy bleeding hearts\nThis is GNR announcing Jesus Christ on lead guitar\nFinding Heather Hunter still inside your college VCR\nMirror mirror on the wall, I feel like a fucking dog\nSomething this depraved is not a product of a loving God\nPeriwinkle Pegasus through rat-infested LEGO bricks\nHug his mother briefly, then we're off to see the exorcist\nI will not be checking messages\nWhy, should I be?\n\nSpecial is as special does, you aren't special just because\nYes your mother said you was, that's pretty much what mothers does\nSomeday I might find the pluck to roam the Earth with zero strings\nCut the tether float this feather over eastern seaboard winds forever\nLike seaboard kings invested in the the froth and fog\nThey'll talk of his adventuring and call him things like \"salty dog\"\nHe freed like a bajillion prisoners from some secret haunted vault\nAlways had a L to puff, never yelled \"Get off my lawn!\"\nFull disclosure I don't even have a lawn\nIf I did I'd probably grow the grass until the house was gone\nKick it \u2018til the town forget the address or the house at all\nThis is how performance art exacerbates an albatross\nI should maybe shake some hands\nI should turn the music down\nHave some people over without asking them to move a couch\nBut, since you're here I've got this awful futon I could do without\nShould take like two seconds...", "title": "Hot Dogs", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/d01189aa12ec22348da8b6fdb271f6fd.633x629x1.png", "year": "2017-11-01"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
