Pull out some brew\nAnd make 'em feel it when I say a rhyme\nCause ain't no telling, when my time coming\nNiggas gunning, but I got no time for running\nYou ain't missing nothing, but drama and your mama\nI swear I walk these streets I pack my heat, these niggas don't care\nAnd to my G's on lock, I pop the top\nPull out some liquor for your tears, and all these lost years\n\n[Hook - 2x]\n\n[H.A.W.K.]\nNow time has gone by, and the years have passed\nTrying to block you out of my mind, is a complicated task\nI mash for my cream, but my job ain't done\nTake it from John it ain't no fun, it's easier said than done\nTo get over you, my boy Big B\nYou gone but not forgotten, up in H.A.W.K.'s memory\nDay-Lee I stop and stare, gaze in the air\nKnowing that nothing is impossible, through hope and prayer\nSo my big bro, I know you know\nIt happened a long time ago, but it's hard for me to let go\nNow C-O and also, K.K. and Big Dead\nDoing time for the crime, keeping that family fed\nHold your head up high, and avoid the shife\nCause when the judge gave you ya sentence, he didn't say life\nWill I see you again, I know the thought is scary\nThe Obituary cemetery, and then you buried, hail Mary\n\n[Hook - 4x]\n\n(*Big Moe singing*)", "title": "Missing Our G\u2019s"}]}
