Kennedy]\nThe artist, however faithful to his personal vision of reality, becomes the last champion of the individual mind and sensibility Against an intrusive society and an officious state\nHe has, as Frost said, a lover's quarrel with the world\nIn pursuing his perceptions of reality\nHe must often sail against the currents of his time\nThis is not a popular role\nYet in retrospect, we see how the artist's fidelity has strengthened the fibre of our national life\nIf sometimes our great artists have been the most critical of our society\nIt is because their sensitivity\nAnd their concern for justice, which must motivate any true artist\nMakes him aware that our Nation falls short of its highest potential\nI see little of more importance to the future of our country and our civilization than full recognition of the place of the artist\nIf art is to nourish the roots of our culture\nSociety must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him\nWe must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda, it is a form of truth\nFor poets, there is nothing worse for our trade than to be in style\nIn free society art is not a weapon and it does not belong to the spheres of polemic and ideology\nThe highest duty of the writer, the composer, the artist is to remain true to himself\nAnd to let the chips fall where they may\n\n[Kid Cudi]\nHey let's have some fun this time"}]}
