Quoi de neuf?\nEverything the same under the sun, that's why we burnin' up\nDon't believe astrology, but man, I hated cancer\nBreast, lung, throat, blood, prayin' for an answer\nSeem like it was yesterday, they came and took your breath away\nAnd I ain't get a chance to tell you everything I want to say\nNow they say your sister got it too\nYeah, they say it's true\nGuess it's never finished 'til it's you\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\n\n[Chorus 2: Lecrae]\nOne time for the memories, two times for the crew\nThree times for the love, y'all\nAnd four times for the truth\nAnd some days are a nightmare\nAnd some dreams come true\nBut the Lord's still right there\nIt's just d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nIt's just d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nIt's just d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, y'all\nIt's just d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\n\n[Outro: Lecrae]\nIt's just d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nIt's just d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, y'all\nIt's just d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nAnd some days are a nightmare\nAnd some dreams come true\nBut the Lord's still right there\nIt's just d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
