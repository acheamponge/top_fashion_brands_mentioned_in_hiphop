I got this urge to rock a show\nDamn near everywhere I go\nAre we there yet? I got this urge to rock a show\nDamn near everywhere I go\nAre we there yet? I got this urge to rock a show\nDamn near everywhere I go\nAre we there yet? I got this urge to rock a show\nDamn near everywhere I go\n\n(Break)(x2)\nI can't take this, are we there yet?\nPut the pedal to the metal, and let's ride!\n\nWe on these crazy highways, smoke away the night before\nConversating about when we come back, it's got to be just as dope\nOh the party in the parking lots, on the streets up by the beaches\nIt takes so much time to get there, I always have the urge to speak\n\n(Chorus)\nBoogie nights, doing it right\nUp till the sun comes up so who's driving?\n\nAll I know is that you better pay attention\nThere might be something, you're missing\nSo keep your eyes wide open\nAnd look out for something weird\n\n(talking)", "year": "2005-03-22"}]}
