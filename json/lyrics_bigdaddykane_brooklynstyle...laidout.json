Time to represent for the map\nWhere the peeps smoke blunts and like to wear mad gold caps\nThe party addict about to explode\nFrom the 1-1-2, the double-3 ill zip code\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nParlayin on the corner, drinkin 40's shootin cee-lo\nIt's a Brooklyn thing, aight? You know our steelo\nAnd for those who just don't know how it go\nPlay like a substitute teacher and ACT like you know\n\n[Scoob]\nSo yo, who wanna set it? You better kick your best G\nYou and your whole entourage couldn't test me\nI represent for the fo' main\nAnd if you're not a booty bandit, then niggas can't hang\n\nChorus\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nNow, let's get straight down to the point\nI represent for this Brooklyn joint, baby pah, where we're takin it to\nMakin a few dollars don't mean you gotta forget\nWhere you come from and try to be someone, that you're really not\nAnd front with what you got\nYou're gonna be looked at as a black man still so keep it real\nWhat type of mission can I say you on?\nBecause you musta done changed to some Grey Poupon, heh\nI'm really happy to see you blew up\nBut always remember my man you grew up\nIn the PJ's all your life, in a broken home\n(Scoob: Well alright now)\nUp in the PJ's all your life, keepin it strong, WHAT!\nI be the Louis Ave livin, live long lastin lover\nBonafied black brother, word to the mother\nSkilled at trades at hand with those who made\nThe man with support and always stayed a fan\nMy dialectic style is perfected\nIn ways you can't imagine rap bein accepted\nFunk'll slam like a doper jam, pops\nI'm takin mine like taxes with Uncle Sam\nSo check out the asiatic type of flow\nLike water in the Nile, but it's Brooklyn style\n\nChorus\n\n[Scoob]\nYo, this is Big Scoob, no practice\nI'm flippin on niggas like little kids on that mattress\nYou know my style, Baby Pah from the PJ's\nMy lyrics so dope, they too fat for local DJ's\nSo hear me out, no doubt, no need for screamin\nMy boys in the back, clockin your jewels, and they scheamin\nWhy did they step to me, I hit em, bow, bu-dow\nKnocked out his fronts cause the kid was mad fragile\nNo need for beef chief I'm rollin mad deep\nSo pick up your teeth, I got him shakin like a leaf\nNot tryin to scare you, I just wanna aware you\nI bet you won't even look at my face (WHAT WHAT WHAT) I dare you\nYo nigga please, yo I'm nice with these\nWhile you're guardin your grill, I'll be beatin up your kidneys\nMe and my boys with the fat tec 9's\nWith my joint cocked back, in case a punk tried to take mines\nWhere I'm from there's no need for hesitation\nWe cock and squeeze, now where's the doctor for this patient?\nHe's drippin blood and now he's down to his last breath\nBut he won't make it, cause he knows that my joint is def\nThe ill, type of Brooklyn artist\nWho rocks the har-dest, regard-less\nWho you know and where you're from I pull your file\n(How?)
