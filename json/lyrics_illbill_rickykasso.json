Who's scheming?\nWho's smoking angel dust with Rick and Russell?\nWho's equipped to hustle?\nWho's the one that always thinks first and who's the muscle?\nWho's the bible burner?\nDid that guy that wrote Fight Club realize that 'Tyler Durden' rhymes with 'violent murder'?\nSometimes I gotta\nRethink my strategy\nRethink reality\nRethink sanity", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8ada7e190ceb4cd543137da9736ec2ae.640x640x1.jpg", "album": "Howie Made Me Do It 3", "year": "2013-11-26"}]}
