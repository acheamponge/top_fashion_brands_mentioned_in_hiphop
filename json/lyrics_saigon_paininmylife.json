Then maybe I should just stay away\nLet my man Trey Songz and them hit it\n\n[Hook: Trey Songz]\nSo much pain in my life, if there was pain up heaven\nWouldn't the rain leave bloodstains down here\n'Cause down here, not much changed in the game\n'Cause everybody wanna thug, man\nSo much pain in my life, if you knew the pain I sustained\nJust from lettin' my gun bang, yeah\nYou would pump your breaks young man\nYou would jump in the other lane\nSo much pain in my life, if there was pain up heaven\nWouldn't the rain leave bloodstains down here\n'Cause down here, not much changed in the game\n'Cause everybody wanna thug, man\nSo much pain in my life, if you knew the pain I sustained\nJust from lettin' my gun bang, yeah\nYou would pump your breaks young man\nYou would jump in the other lane", "album": "The Moral of the Story"}], "artist": "Saigon"}
