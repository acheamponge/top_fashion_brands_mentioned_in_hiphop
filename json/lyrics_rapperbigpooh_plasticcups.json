Uh!\n\n[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]\nYo, I flow liquid, Poobie been gifted\nWrote it in my manual watch how I shift it\nNo breaks, two takes at the max\nHeavy on facts got me cruisin at a slow speed\nHaters watch from afar and catch nose bleeds\nOr do some Big Syke shit like have your car keys\nA bad seed tryin to do good\nNiggas can't cause they too hood, I'm too nice!\nI'm steady rollin like two dice\nYou now starrin at a fresh slice, for my old man\nRapper tryin to touch old grams\nPut a couple on the stand keep my people out of prison\nThey praise me faithfully no religion\nI thank God everyday what's He's givin\nI'm livin, no glamourous life\nAin't nobody sayin, \"Yeah Rapper, you do that light!\"\nI do this right! You lookin at the sun\nOr you lookin at the one and the rest is flash lights\nSomebody tell these pussy niggas good night\nI'm like a pair of stretch jeans homey - extra tight!\nGet it right or get it right where you stand\nI say I'm on the mission my nigga I'm not playin!\nShoutout to Ronnie J what's up\n\n[Hook: in tune to J Dilla's \"Love Movin'\"]\nWe keep it ghet-to with the plastic cups\nI keep it ghet-to with the plastic cups\nReal ghet-to with the plastic cups\nWe keep it ghet-to with the plastic cups\nR.I.P.

I can do bad on my own\nGot me pickin up trash, my whole summer is gone\nSeventeen years old, man I\nShoulda been home\nInstead of out doin dumb shit, I wanna do fun shit\nGo to house parties with the cats that I run with\nGet drunk, smoke weed, party and pass out\nSleep in late instead of takin the trash out\nWorkin for free, I need to work with a fee\nThis community service shit just ain't workin for me\n\n[Hook: in tune to J Dilla's \"Love Movin'\"]\nUh, I keep it ghet-to with the plastic cups\nWe keep it ghet-to with the plastic cups\nReal ghet-to with the plastic cups\nR.I.P.
