No\nIt's never me, I'm glad to say\nI've been changed like presidential campaigns\nUse to wake up in the morning pursuing the wrong things\nNow I wake up in the morning pursuing the Lord's name\nTake me higher than the highest, You're my hope and desire, lifting me up high\nDespite of this gravity, lead me higher\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n[Hook: Mike Donehey]\nLead me higher\nLead me higher\nAnd lift my eyes up\nTo the light where\nI can see all the pain coming to an end\nLead me higher into Your fire\nBurn away all other desires\nAnd let my heart beat again"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
