Sometimes I feel nice\nMost times it feels right, re-charge, re-live and re-die\nWe get, Asics on my feet\nEdward Norton, no sleep\nOut in Dubai for three weeks\nI be with my team\nWhite phone, no clone\nLean, lean, a broken home\nFuck with me, I'll break your bones\n\n[Hook: Baba Stiltz]\nRecharge my whole life\nUpload all my sorrow\nSmoking, feeling so nice\nNo tomorrow\n\n[Verse 2]\nI be getting money like my first name Curren$y\nSwitching lanes, switch address like they heard of me\nThe further we go, I'ma put you in the snow\nI'ma leave you where it's cold\nDo you wanna recharge?\nPenthouse on Mars\nBars like a prisoner\nI could be your minister\nDreams looking sinister\nI could be your minister\nDreams looking sinister\n\n[Hook: Baba Stiltz]\nRecharge my whole life\nUpload all my sorrow\nSmoking, feeling so nice\nNo tomorrow", "title": "Re-charge"}]}
