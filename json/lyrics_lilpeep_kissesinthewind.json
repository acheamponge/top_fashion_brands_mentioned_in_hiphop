(Fu, fu, fu)\n\n[Chorus: LiL PEEP]\nBlowing kisses in the wind, I'mma show her how I swim\nWhen the lights get dim and the time right\nWe just met on meeting ends, I could fuck my bitch's friends\nI'mma fuck that bitch to death, yeah, her pussy tight\nBlowing kisses in the wind, I'mma show her how I swim\nWhen the lights get dim and the time right\nWe just met on meeting ends, I could fuck my bitch's friends\nI'mma fuck that bitch to death, yeah, her pussy tight\n\n[Verse: Lil Tracy]\nI can see the future, I see paparazzi\nBad bitch riding on me, rolling off the molly\nThat's your girl? Wait, hold up, she ain't let me know it\nInstagram, she posting photos just hoping I notice\nStep in the club, they tryna get cameras in focus\nI'm a vampire, I do not like the light on me\nFuck a friend, fuck a homie, I'm all by my lonely\nKush smoking, wine pouring at four in the morning\nPeep and Tracy, two Mercedes, we race to the castle\nNo new friends, I feel like Drake, baby, I'm such a asshole\nBreak the cocaine off the brick and put it in her asshole\nVampire in the moonlight, counting up the pesos\n\n[Chorus: LiL PEEP]\nBlowing kisses in the wind, I'mma show her how I swim\nWhen the lights get dim and the time right\nWe just met on meeting ends, I could fuck my bitch's friends\nI'mma fuck that bitch to death, yeah, her pussy tight\nBlowing kisses in the wind, I'mma show her how I swim\nWhen the lights get dim and the time right\nWe just met on meeting ends, I could fuck my bitch's friends\nI'mma fuck that bitch to death, yeah, her pussy tight"}], "artist": "Lil Peep"}
