MTV Raps\nWhat's the haps on the craps?\nShake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em\nRoll 'em in a circle of homies and watch me break 'em\nWith the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven\nSeven even back do' Lil' Joe\nPicked up the cash flow\nThen we played bones, and I'm yellin domino\nPlus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A\nToday was a good day\n\nHehe..\n\nLeft my homie's house paid\nPicked up a girl been tryin to do since the twelve grade\nIt's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic\nThe Lakers beat the Supersonics\nFelt on the big fat fanny\nPulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny\nAnd my jimmy runs deep, so deep\nSo deep put her butt to sleep\nWoke her up around one\nShe didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun\nDrove her to the pad and I'm coastin\nTook another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion\nI was glad everything had worked out\nDropped her butt off and then chirped out\nToday was like one of those fly dreams\nDidn't even see a berry flashin those high beams\nNo helicopter lookin for the murder\nTwo in the mornin got the Fatburger\nEven saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp\nAnd it read, \"Ice Cube's a pimp\"\nDrunk as hell but no throwin up\nHalf way home and my pager still blowin up\nToday I didn't even have to use my A.K\nI gotta say it was a good day", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bd986178756b67188db2d06a77696b78.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Bootlegs & B-Sides", "year": null}]}
