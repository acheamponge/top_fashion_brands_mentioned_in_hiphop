I'm Horny, short for the Horned Reaper\nI'm chums with the Dungeon Keeper\nUnbelievers better take a step back\nBecause I set traps till they leave your necks snapped\nForget a pimp slap switch up the syntax\nTake away the P, see I deliver Imp Slaps\nThere's a slim chance that you've ever seen an enemy\nWith melanin as red as this; the menacingest skin rash\nBetter bring your shin pads\nCause when I swing axes\nThere's an equal need for medicine and bin bags\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm Horny, short for the Horned Reaper\nI'm chums with the Dungeon Keeper\n(x2)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou ought to have taken a tad more care\nWith your fortification 'cause that wall there's\nGonna fall and then cave in, I'll nab your lair\nYou'll be sore as the day when I stabbed your bare bottom\nAnd in case you've forgotten\nI hail from a place that is fatally rotten\nSo debased I can make even Satan pee off\nAnd I must say that is painfully often\nYour safe, I'm unlockin', knicking your millions\nSticking your minions straight in a coffin\nI plunge in to your dungeon, lungin' through your little buggers\nLike I'm cuttin' through an onion\nUnder ye' foot, plunder ye' loot\nFunneling your funds to me, can you compute?\nThe heart of your dungeons the dungeon heart\nI'm taking pleasure, breaking it and pulling it apart\nThen take your treasure, claiming it, as bullion in carts\nNow you see red, I'm the bully in the dark\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm horny, short for the Horned Reaper\nI'm chums with the Dungeon Keeper (x2)\n\n[Outro]\nThe hand of evil strikes again!", "year": "2014-02-03"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
