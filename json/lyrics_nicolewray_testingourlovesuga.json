I want the whole world to see\n\nSuga, see I'm just testin' our love for the record\nJust testin' our love\nOhh suga, see I'm testin' my love for the record\n[Incomprehensible] ohh suga\n\nDon't you get funny with me, give me your hand, let me hold it\nDo you have got something to hide or maybe too much pride?\nYou say I'm the only one, doesn't show as good as you tell it\nI want the world to see that you're happy with me\n\nSuga, see I'm just testin' our love for the record\nJust testin' our love\nOhh suga, see I'm testin' my love for the record\n[Incomprehensible]\n\nSuga, see I'm just testin' our love for the record\nJust testin' our love\nOhh suga, see I'm testin' my love for the record\n[Incomprehensible] suga\n\nGot us testing\n\nSuga, see I'm just testin' our love for the record\nJust testin' our love\nOhh suga, see I'm testin' my love for the record\n[Incomprehensible]\n\nSuga see, I'm just testing our love for the record\nJust testing our love\nOhh suga, see I'm testin' my love for the record\n[Incomprehensible] suga"}], "artist": "Nicole Wray"}
