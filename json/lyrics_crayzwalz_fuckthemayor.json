Hey, what\u2019s that on your hip?  Hey, let me check that\n[Civilian]\nYo man, that ain\u2019t no fucking gun.  That\u2019s my beeper.  Get the fuck out of here, man\n[Officer]\nHey, hey, what\u2019s that, what\u2019s that?  The brick fist gang?\n[Civilian]\nThis ain\u2019t no gang symbol.  It\u2019s a Stronghold t-shirt, you dickhead!\n[Officer]\nHey, hey buddy, wanna [?] me?\n[Civilian]\nWhat you, what you gon\u2019 do?  Arrest me?  Come on\n[Officer]\nHey, hey, come here.  Officer requesting backup.  Officer requesting backup.  Officer requesting backup\n\n[C-Rayz Walz Talking over Skit]\nFuck them niggas\nLike a hundred niggas right there.  Stronghold, OBS, People\u2019s Army.  I\u2019ll kill y\u2019all niggas.  Fuck Rudy\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nI wrote this one blunted.  Get that bitch in Gracie Mansion hunted\nNY, do or die.  Who done it?\nBlue suits coming?  Fuck that\u2014I ain\u2019t running\nOn point, shooting sharp shit like ninja gunmen\nSlugs for Uhuru.  STD niggas is voodoo\nUs against the pigs something brutal\u2014nothing neutral\nFuck what you used to.  Rudy wanna swing ya from trees\nWith the noose loop for a deuce deuce\nBlocks is hot, politics this dragon breathes\nGet a nigga 25 to life for a bag of weed\nThey ain\u2019t catching me.  Cappadonna said, \u201cRun\u201d\nI hold knife-sized guns and sell branch until I\u2019m done\nLike stic.man, rolling out for dead presidents\nStill know the plan of the hit man.  Evidence:\nThe blue van.  On some bullshit like a tourist\nI got the eye of the tiger like Horace in the jungle fortress\nUndercover cops think they Bruce Willis on some fake shit\nBut I\u2019m Keanu Reeves in the Matrix\nQuick to run with speed through a building basement\nBeats got my heart racing\nGiuliani think it\u2019s mad niggas in the street that need replacing, long vacation\nI\u2019m saying, \u201cHold up.\u201d  They roll up, my shots make \u2018em leak donuts\nClip bombs in the precinct frequent\nStations are like the phoenix when I\u2019m done creeping\nOn the D train, I see flames like \u201cDouse him\u201d\nFuck hell\u2014jog through Central Park\nCatch you while they can\u2019t tell I hold clips.  TNT patrolling my dick\nI\u2019ll blame it on Judy \u2018cause he put out the hit\nFucking faggot.  Made my hustle hard\nCan\u2019t even swipe [?] with my metro card\nFucking transvestite.  Yo, where you dressing your wig at?\nIf that bitch get shot, bet green money I did that\n\u2018Cause police smoke crack.  Even rats carry gats\nRacism relax where I\u2019m at\nDrinking malt liquor.  Push ups in the slum\nAll my niggas act dumb and get smart when cops come\nThey think they musketeers with shotguns\nFuck a badge number\u2014this summer, I\u2019m grudge-thirst with mad hunger\nRevenge for my black ass without the plunger\n41 shots?  I send 82 drama-full\nTo kill Rudy Giu\u2014rest in peace Amadou\nFuck the mayor!"}]}
