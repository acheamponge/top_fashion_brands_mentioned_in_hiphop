at the Moon\nAfter cesium exposure, launch homing missiles off of the shoulder\nSpider drones blow the front doors open\nKick your picket fence over, shoot up the engine block motor\nExplosion, fire extinguish the chauffeur\nThey say black lives matter for sunrise sacrifice on the Sabbath\nIs this a floating city or a sinking palace?\n\n[Break: Wrestling commentary samples]\n\n[Verse 2: Canibus]\nI focus on one thing, the sound of insects crunching\nRefugees barefoot hunting\nWars and rumours of wars, dullahs wearing scrubs doing chores\nDelivering new bars on the floors\nSmall cities under the surface, shadow government purpose\nOver medicated population make 'em nervous\nRelocate, recover, retaliate\nBloodthirst for the solar sunburst, I salivate\nPurple lips call me amethyst face\nDriver says, \"Whatever it takes, just don't let Canibus escape\"\nCoyote wolf, hybrid breeder, 3D print lower receiver\nPass it to my ominous leader\nShort term speaker, long term dreamer, Massachusetts, Medina\nNigga got more excuses than FEMA\nBaking in my bugout bag, my dog tail wag\nThree days a week, I'm at Full Sail class\nAllahu Akbar Ferrari world snack bar\nThe return of 19th galaxy rap star\nMirror mirror on the wall, sing to my broad like Aaron Hall\nMy name tattooed above bra\nMy logo tattooed barely above drawers\nLove it to see she didn't get nothing stupid like dog paws\n\"Just you and me\" castaway key\nNice room, 2 G's, blue seat, cool breeze\nIt's takes 720 degrees to move me\n360 degrees is food for the beast\nK-Solo, Canibus unique, Kevlaar kids, big beats\nBorn Sun peace, god peace\n\n[Break: Wrestling commentary samples]\n\n\n[Sample: Unknown artist]\nI just handed a mic\nYou should save yourself\nI just handed a mic\nRun for your life\nI just handed a mic\nBring you to the Guillotine\nBringin' you that  [?] dramatic\n\n[Verse 3:  Burns]\nHey yo\nSmoke a blunt a cigarette and drink a brew before breakfast\nDrunk before lunch and walk around like I'm headless\nHip hop scholar not the best that should test this\nCause Burns is a force that you don't want to mess with\nWhat's with the stuntin' do not know [?]\nGot a crew big enough to clock ya stop ya proper\nBout to bring the pain\nBigger than the movie Clockers\nAnd they'll be sick of my name\nTil they need to see a doctor\nFat rhymes flat lines\nTravelin' at mock speed\nMetaphors mega roar\nLeaving niggas knock me\nSing a Hail Mary to the one who's trying to Pac me\nCause Burns got that rock that's top\nWith hip hop speeds\n\nFrom \"King of Tallulan\"\n\n[Intro: Earl Hazard]\nSay Bis\nMe know I'm not ready for the fire, sin\nGiven that Saddam bomb fire Rude Boy that ruckus\nSin?\n\n[Verse 1:  Canibus]\nEarl Hazard\nKing Talula\nAcronym NWC (is it me?)\nNiggas With Computers\nBig horn trombone tubas\nEthanol front lawn movers\nCatepillars with blowers\nComin out the hood loofahs\nPink boots not cheap loops\nFire belt seat belt harness\nLow cage, I don't need no booth\nSheriff\nGregory Peck\nMy eyes wide open all the time even if I know the enemy's dead\nHere's the thing Capital C\nClose quarters rap with the beat\nMusic casualties don't matter to me\nCan-I-Bus nom de plume\nRip the Jacker rendezvous'\nA brave new world\nDrop they shoes\nIt's Headquarters\nSheep to the slaughter\nVinegar IP\nNo water\nPotassium burns your veins til you holler\nBanana man selling bananas from banana stands in Afghanistan\nBartered bananas with the camera man\nI'm the hammer man any which way you can\nEastwood Callahan\nWhat's so funny fancy pants?\nIt's a battle staff warm-up\nReserve contingent callin' em up\nPoorly trained, no guts, they all suck\nHot day agalo agalo\nPlant my plantanos\nPrimer de sabado de el jefe vamanos\nI'm a son of a bitch black baboon silver back raccoon\nIn the shit-hit-the-fan chat room\n\n[Verse 5: Canibus]\nMagnus Sebastian\nCanibus  [?]\nAssassins\nPoetry manifest action\nI've got a dove faced grill\nMy face shaped like snowplow sill\nSnowmobile tank tracks for wheels\nI say respect to the nth degree to the fullest\nGive em mercy with a bottle of water\nOr a bullet\nHard body buff, bad rotator cuff\nMotivated to get going when the goin' get rough\nThey call me Canibus Electronica\nPneumonic\nI recover rare earth metal drunk electronics\nNo matter how you slice it\nWe meet our fate\nThe ruling class says let them eat shit layer cake\nNano lithium powered\nI sit atop trillium tower\nCounting every single invisible hour\nAutomaton automated foo fighter formations\nStandin' ovation\nPoet Laureate of the Nation\nI play my part for this law star\nRock tar par plot\nShit when I sit with the pop tart\nNip to tune per miss mock tot\nFlare no qui velo
