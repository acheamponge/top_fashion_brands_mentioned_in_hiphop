(go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\n\n[Hook: Tedashii]\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\n\n[Verse 1: Lecrae]\nLord, kill me If I don't preach the gospel\nI'm still in my twenties, but I'll die if I got to\nEh man, I'm already dead, man, forget my flesh\nI done been crossed over, see the full court press\nI'm a full court mess if the Lord don't use me\nRunning from my trials thinkin' everything's groovy\nIf the cross don't move me then I don't wanna breath no more\nIf I ain't seeing Christ, partner, I don't wanna see no more\nRep Him every day without worrying about a bruising\nI been to China, man, I seen some real persecution\nIf you didn't know Christ, would your life look the same?\nCan they tell you value Jesus by the way you rep his name?\nMan, what's the point of living if I'm living for myself?\nLord, empty out my life before I put you on the shelf\nSo for God, I go hard, I don't wanna die tonight\nBut there's too many people living who ain't heard about the Christ\n\n[Hook: Tedashii]\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\n\n[Verse 2: Lecrae]\nWent to Asia had to duck and hide for sharin' my faith\nThey tell me \"Water it down\" when I get back to states\nThey say \"Tone the music down, you might sell a lot of records, but it's people out here dying and none of 'em heard the message\"\nTook my wifey on mission trip in Central America\nShared her testimony, 40 people stood and stared at her\nWhen she said Jesus, should have seen, it was insane\nCause 40 out of 40 never heard of Jesus name\nOh man, we ain't focused on the war we just kickin' it\nWorried bout our image and our space up on the internet\nTake me out the game coach I don't wanna play no mo\nIf can't give it all I got and leave it out there on the court\nThank you for the Grace for the will and the desire\nGot me living for your glory stead of living to retire\nBut I pray I'll never tire of going hard for Messiah\nI don't need no motivation, You the reason I'm inspired\n\n[Hook: Tedashii]\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\n\n[Verse 3: Tedashii]\nGo Hard for the Lord baby 'til He takes us home\nGo Hard for the Father baby go on get it on\nThat's what that is baby, that what that mean, that what that mean\nThat what That is baby, That what that mean, that what that mean\nWha-What that mean?\nThat mean that we, should be out up in the streets\nNot just in houses with our bible's summarizing what we read\nMan this ain't deep (man this ain't deep), why we ain't doing what we read\nIts like we sleep (its like we sleep)\nBut sinners sleepwalk when they sleep\nSo why can't we (so why can't we), the redeemed of the LORD\nAct out, what He said, and make a scene for the LORD\nAction-cut, say what, like we was the director\nBut you better get a Grip like movie sets, and get to stepping (Martin)\nI know you done it da-done it, da-done-and heard it all\nYou was going hard for the Lord before you heard this song\nBut don't play yourself to save ya self and walk in fear\nScripture's like a mirror, the truth is closer than it appears\n\n[Pre-Hook: Lecrae]\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\n\n[Hook: Tedashii]\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nGo hard (go hard)\nOr go home (go home)\nLord, use me (Lord, use me)\nLord, use me
