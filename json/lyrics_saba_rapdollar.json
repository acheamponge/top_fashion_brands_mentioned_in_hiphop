Clear?\nLike resuscitation, bro I brought it back\nTo Life, To Light\nTill I die my hair turning gray\nMy bills never paid on time\nThis the life that I chose\nGetting choked up on the stage at 15\nIs this really your scene?\nWhile Pops was singing\nWhile Mom unemployed\nWhy Uncle locked up?\nWe on Massasoit\nWith a 4-track and more raps\nAnd more rats in the basement\nI wish I could build me a spaceship and fly\nTowards them\n\n[Hook]\nRap Dollars\nRap Dollars\nRap Dollars\nRap Dollars\n\n[Verse 2]\nSay, did that blog post you?\nPro tool, hard work paying off\nWith a call from an A and R\nAnd a coffin to your old life\nAnd the cause of death\u2019s a larger check\nDoctor check his pulse, is he ok?\nOr is he too far gone?...\nThe Drake\nThe traits\nThat he got from his pop got him popular\nHe popping now, consider dropping out\nCuz school the opps\nWith no illusion, all these obstacles is optical\nThe sight 20-20, if I ain\u2019t on when I hit 20\nAre you still rocking with me?\nThat\u2019s all I ask\nThat\u2019s my concern\nSee me to my turn\nBandwagon bad rappers\nYou can see my gift, like a bad wrapper\nSab fans is family\nThis for grammys and them\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: With Jean Deaux]\nThis for all of y\u2019all\nWho always had to hustle hard\nThis all we know\nThis all we are\n\nX4", "album": "GETCOMFORTable"}], "artist": "Saba"}
