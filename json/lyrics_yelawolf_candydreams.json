(Four)\nYep, and I'm wondering, which one, (Three)\nWhatever moves best to the kick drum. (Two)\nGet me to the moon, it's this one. (One)\n\n[Verse 1: Yelawolf]\nOne, two, three, feet and rising\nThere are five I wanted to plug one\nHey, the day in L.A.'s got soul\nIt's Night in Alabama do you want some sun?\nSo, what's a 20 minute flight pulling your boots like Napoleon Dynamite\nWe'll work it up while we work up an appetite\nLooking at Earth from my personal satellite\nGot it right\nThen got left\nGoing up - take a breath\nIt's a giant leap for all mankind\nBut for us it's just a simple step, baby step\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Yelawolf]\nPeople in cars go vroom\nSpeeding to the NOCO vroom vroom\nLet's go half on a tank\nIf you got some fuel then I got that boom boom\nCrank my truck I'm still a country boy PBR's in the cup\nYou wanna sit beside the astronaut farmer\n5 4 3 2 1 buckle up!\n\n[Spoken bridge]\nDon't worry\nI'll bring you back home safe\nIt's okay\nHahaha!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Yelawolf]\nDang, she's got that ground control\nI'm looking at the skies where should we go to-Na-na-na-Night\nLights in the club don't shine like that tha-tha- that's gotta be your back\nYou almost gave me a heart attack\nYou musta put something in my cognac!\nI'm kinda like an Alabama advocate\nMyspace game will now be maxed\nAnd if you wanna know where i'll be at\nThe ship's out back with\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Candy & Dreams"}]}
