Git! Go on! Git! Go on! Git!\nI'm out here chasing cream\nGo on! Git! Go on! Git! Go on! Git!\nNeed it, by any means..\n\n[Verse 1: Ace Hood]\nMama went and got it, daddy never home\nStarted learning from the streets, but I know my heat a chrome\nNever sold no kind of dope, just a real nigga\nTake the canned foods, I'm tryna get a real dinner\nGet your money stacked, your paper keep away the feds\nKeep it real and fuck a hater\nThat's what my brother said\nKeep my head high, nevermind them local jokers\nFrom the minute I wake, I grind\nGotta make that monthly quota\nWe too legit to quit though\nCan't stop, no wait, no slow-mo\nGotta feed the team and my kin folk\nThink of all the stress that I've been through\nWay too much fuckin problems\nWay too much fuckin bills\nBy any means necessary, gotta see my mom in?\n\n[Chorus: Ace Hood]\nAnother day, another dollar\nEvery 24, I'm thinking money and the power\nGo on!

Blew him for 30 bands\nGotta get it while the getting's good\nThat Desert Eagle stainless steel, the handle cherry wood\nI got that G-lock, 33 ladder works\nI bag a bullet to your belly, make your bladder burst\nNow you pissin blood, I'm fishing for grub\nI'm in the water with the Great White, I'm whippin up\nDon't make me hop our with that thing and start spraying shit\nChopper bullets longer than the Section 8 waitlist\n\n[Chorus: Ace Hood]\nAnother day, another dollar\nEvery 24, I'm thinking money and the power\nGo on!

All in his own piss\nFather bless me: Jesus Christ\nCause I'm about to go and commit my worst sin\nJust know that whenever we gonna defend it and survival\nOf the people that I love and all the people that I feed\nAnd I'm ready to kill and massacre anything movin\nPass me the rest, muthafucka, best believe I'm going in\nSee now I'm commin to get it and then I STOP\nDon't speed-rap this this part, let me walk thru em\nThis topic... we addressing... so serious: let me talk to em\nLook at my baby's eye, while they smile at me playful\nFuck you think I'm gonna do when the hunger gets painful?\nEvery day I hit the street and I taste it like grapefruit\nIf I ain't eat your food yet - you better be grateful!\nBe grateful that you had time to think that I overlooked it\nAnd you had an extra day with it before I came and took it\n\n[Chorus: Ace Hood]\nAnother day, another dollar\nEvery 24, I'm thinking money and the power\nGo on! Get it! Go on! Get it! Go on!
