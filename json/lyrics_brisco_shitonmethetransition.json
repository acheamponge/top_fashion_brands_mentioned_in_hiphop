Yeah\nYa'll know who it is (Do you know who I is...)\nBrisco... uuunh...\nI-I been kinda puzzled\nI got a question... Yeah\n\n[Chorus:]\nI been such a good guy, Why they shit on me\nTell me, Lord, Why they shit on me\nAnd I been down all my life, Why they shit on me\nTell me, ya'll, Why ya'll shit on me\nAnd sometimes, sometimes I can't win for losing\nAnd if the option was there, I couldn't win for choosing (Yeah...)\nAnd it's the transition...\n\n[Verse 1:]\nYeah... I been such a good guy, why they shit on me\nSell me one, then go in my key\nGimme dap and try to fuck my girl\nYou can have her, you can give her the world\nBut you will never be me\nI said that you can never be me... ha\nI got pressure you can tell I'm pissed\nThe price of pussy and gas prices be higher than a Biiitch... Yeah\nAnd I'm higher than a Biiiitch\nBut I know that niggas switch\nAnd I know that girls talk to other girls\nWho talk to other girls and start some shit\nSee, ain't that a Bitch...\nWhen you shove shit off a Bitch think you soft\nAnd when you hit 'em with the hammer\nThen yougo to the slammer\nThen uh... this the transition\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2:]\nYeah... my co-D told on me and I can't see\nMy co-D tellin' on me, I couldn't believe\nMy co-D rode on me... ha\nI saw the deposition, yeah, he wrote for me\nHe told 'em everything we did and everything we sold\nI couldn't believe that he could be so cold\nAnd it's the transition...\nYeah... we never really got along because I had more pearls\nHe could never be strong 'cause he was weak for them girls\nHe could never be wrong 'cause he was always right\nAnd when it came to coppin' bottles he was always tight\nHe was always talkin' bout the drop offs and pick ups\nAnd when them people came, they dropped off and picked up (Damn...)\nThis the other transition\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nHa... If you a hater get away-ay-aaaay\nCause I been down and I been real since the first day\nYeah, and listen dawg, I was always there\nAnd you ain't have to think twice, boy, I'm always here\nI make them niggas go away-ay-aaaay\nAnd I been down and I been real since the first day... Yeah (Real talk, real talk, homeboy)\nAnd it's the transition\nI done been down and backstabbed and shot in the foot\nYou wouldn't believe all the shit I took\nCould you believe all I ever really wanted\nWas just to keep it real with' my homie\nAnd when my dawg was down, I would pull 'em up\nAnd when he would drift off, I would pull 'em in\nHa... yea... this the final transition... to win", "year": null, "album": "Revenge"}], "artist": "Brisco"}
