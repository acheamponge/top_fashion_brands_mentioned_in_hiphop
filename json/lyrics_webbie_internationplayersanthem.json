Reconsider read some lither.\"\nSure you on the subject, You sure? Fuck it\nYou know we got ya back like chiroprac\nTick if that bitch do you dirty\nWe'll wash her ass out in some detergent\nNow hurry hurry\nG'on to the alter\nI know you ain't a pimp, but pimp remember what I taught you\nKeep ya heart 3 stacks, keep yo heart, aye\nKeep yo heart 3 stacks, keep yo heart\nMan these girls is smart 3 stacks these is smart\nPlay ya part\n\nWebbie\n\nSweet Jones\n\nNigga Pimp C taught me not to fuck without a rubber\nLater on the sheets I nutted all over the cover\nDiamonds on the dresser\nHit her with the pressure\nTop notch hoes get the most, not the lesser\nYou know me I fuck a forty thousand in the club\nFuckin up the game, bitch you gets no love\nHigh to the sky blowing pounds of the pot\nA thousand a pot I'm pulling Bentley's off the lot\nI smash with a gray what\nBought me a red\nEvery time we hit the parking lot we turn heads\nSome hoes wanna choose me\nBut they too scary\nRest in peace Pops\nTrillest nigga ever buried\nSweet Jones", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5a6259511dc000afa8b2e11fb5051a00.336x336x1.jpg", "album": null, "title": "Internation Players Anthem"}]}
