Only God knows\nI ain't for sure, give me strength just to change what I can\u2019t\nAnd understand the difference between a nigga and the King that I am\nGotta keep ya finger on the trigger\nPac died, Biggie died, they ain't found a killer\nMomma say she worried \u2019cause I rap about the Government\nAnd how the Church caked other people out there struggling (its real though)\nI just call it how it is, folk\nI\u2019m breathing for a reason, what you here for?\nThey got it where the villains who we cheer for\nCause they murdered all the heroes\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Big K.R.I.T."}
