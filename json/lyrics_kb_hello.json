The Gospel lifts me from my fall\nI have no sins to pay; Jesus has paid them all\nThat's why I preach\nBetter get that Gospel to me\nYou see the power indeed is available through belief\nBelieve\n\n[Hook: Suzy Rock]\nOh, I'm letting go of my yesterday\nGrab a hold free in your grace to live\nThere's no more guilt\nI know that I've been forgiven\nHello new mercies\nHello every morning\nEvery day I live\nIs another day I know that I've been forgiven\n\n[Bridge: Suzy Rock]\nI am His\nHe is mine\nBought with the blood of Christ\nEvery sin\nOn Him lay\nI'm spoken for\nNo condemnation\nI am His\nHe is mine\nBought with the blood of Christ\nEvery sin\nOn Him lay\n\n[Hook: Suzy Rock]\nOh, I'm letting go of my yesterday\nGrab a hold free in your grace to live\nThere's no more guilt\nI know that I've been forgiven\nHello new mercies\nHello every morning\nEvery day I live\nIs another day I know that I've been forgiven\n\n[Hook: Suzy Rock]\nOh, I'm letting go of my yesterday\nGrab a hold free in your grace to live\nThere's no more guilt\nHello new mercies\n[Hello every morning\nEvery day I live\nIs another day I know that I've been forgiven"}], "artist": "KB"}
