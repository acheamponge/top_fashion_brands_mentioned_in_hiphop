Glocks and 100 men\nDroppin' More shells than run and 'em\n\n[Scarface]\nActin Bad\nSmash a nigga stash and mash\nSnatch the bag\nBust him in his ass and dash\nUn cock the mag\nKill him I don't need

can start to soften up\nShit never that\nDog forever my baretta cat\nHittin' niggas in they fitted cap where the letters at\nI told ya'll that the truth in here\nRecognize hottest thing in a booth in here\nThe Gooch in here\nAy yo it's over in here\nGod damn somebody bring me some juice in here\n\n[Scarface]\nI used to be a drug dealer\nHangin in the cut sellin' dime rocks\nGettin' cash to eat with\nPunchin' a time clock\nIn the ghetto makin' small change\nSlingin' till the sun up\nGot to pay my phone bill focusing on the come up\nGot 6 shots numbers strait\nCrank bout 38\nBig boys trippin' on me tryin' to nigga hate\nThis 17 year old Tony Montana type\nAin't never did the killin' but still I'm lovin the drama right\nUndercovers pass by thinkin I don't know the truth\nMakin niggas these offers they know these niggas can't refuse\n(Fade To end)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a5d876dd3d88aa58a26a93ff8e32c391.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2000-02-29", "title": "Mac And Brad", "album":
