"[Hook: Sauce Walka]\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI might take your bitch today, I might pour a fifth today\nGrandmaster my wrist today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today\nI'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich\nI'm feelin' richer than a bitch\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\n\n[Verse 1: Takeoff]\nI just cashed out on a lick\nFeel like creating a bitch\nMe and Philthy we with twenty hoes\nI'm 'bout to break me a bitch\nSlap a bitch with all my rings on\nI beat the race off a bitch\nNever fuck a bitch for free my nigga\nBitch gotta pay for the dick\nI just left the jeweler, nigga got me walkin' out like it's a block of ice on my wrist\nAll my niggas from the trenches, please don't get offended\nSee police, we jumping the fence\n\n[Verse 2: Quavo]\nYoung nigga handsome and wealthy\nQuavo Quavo Makaveli\nThe money you spent on that bitch\nI take the bitch and make her help me\nPull out the lot in a\nPull out the lot in a wraith\nI'm on a jet\nTalking on FaceTime while a bitch give me face\nI'm making money, I'm getting money\nWhy you gon' spend it and waste it?\nI'm in a corporate office with my styrofoam\nWhite man want to taste it\n\n[Hook: Sauce Walka]\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI might take your bitch today, I might pour a fifth today\nGrandmaster my wrist today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today\nI'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich\nI'm feelin' richer than a bitch\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\n\n[Verse 3: Sauce Walka]\nI'm feelin' richer than a bitch\nBuy a pint, pour a six\nI might just pimp out your bitch\n100 thousand dollars, breaking tricks\nTaking dates and doing back flips\nI'm smoking zips, I ain't selling zips\nAll I do is sell sauce, I send a bitch to your house\nDing ding, right at your door\nI'm with Mozzy and we pouring fours\nI'm with Philthy and we in a Ghost\nInvisible, I feel like a ghost\nSauce Twinz, yeah we do the most\nIt's the reason we got all the hoes\nIt's the reason we do all the shows\nAt 19 I was thirty toes\nOn this and that, really sending hoes\nHitting jewelry, buying rose gold\nNow I buy it by the kilo\nRose gold, subzero\nKick a nigga's ass for the cash\nSpill spill spill spill, split then dash\nI worked hard to be a rich nigga\nI prayed to god to be a rich nigga\n\n[Hook: Sauce Walka]\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI might take your bitch today, I might pour a fifth today\nGrandmaster my wrist today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today\nI'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich\nI'm feelin' richer than a bitch\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\n\n[Verse 4: Philthy Rich]\nI'm feeling rich today\nMy bitches hit for 20K\nNow they one week and one day\nYou broke hoes is just in the way\nThe Sauce Twinz was just in the Bay\nWe was just up in the Wraith\nSalute to the nigga Mac Dre\nI pimp on that ho like Mac Dre\nI fired four hoes at one time\nNever had four hoes at one time\nNever had four hoes in your life\nI'm sipping a cup of the slime\nI tell that ho look and she listen\nOne look from the ho and she missing\nThe roof on the foreigns, they missing\nYour diamonds, they don't really glisten\nDesigner is on me, I'm dripping\nThe iron is on me, don't tempt me\nBroke niggas mad so they dissing\nBut no I don't pay it no 'ttention\nI got the bitch down on mission\nI told the ho what is the mission?\nShe only call about chicken\nThe Jackson's, Grant's, and Benjamin's\n\n[Hook: Sauce Walka]\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI might take your bitch today, I might pour a fifth today\nGrandmaster my wrist today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today\nI'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich\nI'm feelin' richer than a bitch\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\n\n[Verse 5: Jose Guapo]\nI'm feeling rich today\nI might fuck your bitch today\nMight flood out my wrist today\nMight go hit a lick today\nI might smoke a zip today\nToday I might drink me an eight\nTomorrow might drink me an eight\nDamn I might drink a whole pint\nI come in steppin' in Maison Margielas\nI got my durag but no I'm not Stella\nI got my racks open, no I won't let up\nI'm finna go ice out the brand new bezel\nPiped up, young rich nigga\nNever cared about a bitch nigga\nMiddle finger to a bitch nigga\nIt's fuck you and your bitch nigga\nI pay a cost to get you knocked off\nHead honcho, nigga I'm the boss\nLet her give me head right on the couch\nFuck on the bitch and I'm kicking her out\nI got designer all over my house\nThey wanna come first, they know what I'm 'bout\nI'm a young nigga that's coming with clout\nSpend 100K just on my mouth\n\n[Hook: Sauce Walka]\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI might take your bitch today, I might pour a fifth today\nGrandmaster my wrist today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today\nI'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich\nI'm feelin' richer than a bitch\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today", "year": "2016-08-24"}]}
