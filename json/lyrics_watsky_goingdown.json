If the nut is what truly makes it foul\nThen just get him close to busting and hand him a paper towel\nYup! No gravy on your chin!\nYup! Everybody wins!\nYup! Squirrel to an acorn\nDudes like to look at dicks in their straight porn\nPut your hands up if you got hangups\nPut your hands up if you got hangups\nIf I could get with it I\u2019d have a wider ocean I\u2019m fishing in\nBut I\u2019m inhibited by my social conditioning\nSo where my head\u2019s at present the odds are gloomy\nThat I would agree to feast on a D that\u2019s presented to me\nBut I\u2019m not officially ruling out\nThat at some point in my life I\u2019ll have a dingaling in my mouth", "image": "https://images.genius.com/caf3c17709b04ff24300da4d62da46fa.630x630x1.jpg", "album": "x INFINITY", "title": "Going Down"}]}
