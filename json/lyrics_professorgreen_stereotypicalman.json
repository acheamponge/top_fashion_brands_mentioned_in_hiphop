Some women say were all the same were all as lame as one another and ought to change, shame this is probably true, Im a stereotypical man thats a reason not an excuse\n\n(Chorus)\nStereotypical man, ill act like I dont need you till you leave and then get you back, Stereotypical man, typical ill love you and leave you with the bill for the cab, stereo typical man, till my breathings done Ill be readin page 3 of the sun, stereo typical man I dont think that youre any other Im just a stereotypical man\nIf you dont know you ought to know that Im male therefore I own the remote control, I speak truthfully, I dont perve at women, no, I appreciate boobies, I mean beauty it was a slip of the tongue, were all grown men even though we live with our mums, something else about how we live, women all we do is eat sleep and shit, this penis means that I dont clean up and I always leave the toilet seat up I dirty big bollocks the dogs nackers are completely stereotypical of what a man is\n\n(Chorus)\nStereotypical man, ill act like I dont need you till you leave and then get you back, Stereotypical man, typical ill love you and leave you with the bill for the cab, stereo typical man, till my breathings done Ill be readin page 3 of the sun, stereo typical man I dont think that youre any other Im just a stereotypical man\nStereotypical I am, its given but what about stereotypical women, Im not bitter its not that I am mad I guess I might get hit with a few handbags but think logically they always expect us to pay but campaign for equality, its logic, obviously if they didn't leave the toilet seat down we would pee on it, be honest, women are all the same all you do is play games youre all the insane, the rage, crazy and change minute to minute, depending on the day what can I say, period. You cry at soppy films always need tissues and hate on other decent chicks, what have women without issues and unicorns got in common, theyre both myths neither exist\n\n(Chorus)\nStereotypical man, ill act like I dont need you till you leave and then get you back, Stereotypical man, typical ill love you and leave you with the bill for the cab, stereo typical man, till my breathings done Ill be readin page 3 of the sun, stereo typical man I dont think that youre any other Im just a stereotypical man", "year": null}]}
