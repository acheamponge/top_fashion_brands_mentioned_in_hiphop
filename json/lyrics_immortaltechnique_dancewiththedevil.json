concern was makin' a million\nBein' the illest hustler that the world ever seen\nHe used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams\nA corrupted young mind at the age of 13\nNigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend\nShe put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober\nHer son's heart simultaneously grew colder\nHe started hangin' out, sellin' bags in the projects\nCheckin' the young chicks, lookin' for hit-and-run prospects\nHe was fascinated by material objects\nBut he understood money never bought respect\nHe built a reputation, 'cause he could hustle and steal\nBut got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal\nSo criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real\nYou see, me and niggas like this have never been equal\nI don't project my insecurities in other people\nHe fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles\nSo he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil\nA feeble-minded young man with infinite potential\nThe product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental\nCoincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed\nDancin' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed\nBut he was sick of sellin' trees and gave in to his greed\n\n[Hook]\nEveryone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences\nYou probably only did a month for minor offenses\nAsk a nigga doin' life if he had another chance\nBut then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance\nDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block\nBut that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock\nDevils used to be God's angels that fell from the top\nThere's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo Billy started robbin' niggas, anything he could do\nTo get his respect back in the eyes of his crew\nStartin' fights over little shit up on the block\nStepped up to sellin' mothers and brothers the crack rock\nWorkin' overtime for makin' money for the crack spot\nHit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine\nFulfillin' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain\nTired of the block niggas treatin' him the same\nHe wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs\nBut when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love\nThey told him any motherfuckin' coward can sell drugs\nAny bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs\nAny nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood\nEven Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club\nBut only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die\nStandin' in front of them, starin' straight into their eyes\nBilly realized that these men were well-guarded\nAnd they wanted to test him before business started\nSuggested rapin' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted\nSo now he had a choice between goin' back to his life\nOr makin' money with made men up in the cyph'\nHis dreams about cars and ice made him agree\nA hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be\nAnd so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three\n\n[Hook]\nEveryone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences\nYou probably only did a month for minor offenses\nAsk a nigga doin' life if he had another chance\nBut then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance\nDance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block\nBut that's what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock\nDevils used to be God's angels that fell from the top\nThere's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey drove around the projects slow while it was rainin'\nSmokin' blunts, drinkin' and jokin' for entertainment\nUntil they saw a woman on the street, walkin' alone\nThree in the mornin', comin' back from work, on her way home\nAnd so they quietly got out the car and followed her\nWalkin' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her\nThey wrapped her shirt around her head\nAnd knocked her onto the floor\n\"This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw\"\nSo Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair\nAnd dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there\nShe struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs\nThey got to the roof and then held her down on the ground\nScreamin', \"Shut the fuck up, and stop movin' around!\"\nThe shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed\nSo Billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jaw\nThe dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin'\nThey kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin'\nBlood leakin' through the cloth, she cried silently\nAnd then they all proceeded to rape her violently\nBilly was made to go first, but each of them took a turn\nRippin' her up and chokin' her until her throat burned\nHer broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned\nWhen they were done and she was lyin'\nBloody, broken and bruised\nOne of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22\nThey told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through\nAnd if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew\nHe thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead\nAnd so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head\n\n[Sample]\nI'm fallin' and I can't turn back\nI'm fallin' and I can't turn back\n\n[Verse 4]\nRight before he pulled the trigger and ended her life\nHe thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice\nAnd he felt strong standin' along with his new brothers\nCocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover\nBut what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter\n'Cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own mother\nShe looked back at him and cried 'cause he had forsaken her\nShe cried more painfully than when they were rapin' her\nHis whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate\nHis corruption had successfully changed his fate\nAnd he remembered how his mom used to come home late\nWorkin' hard for nothin', because now what was he worth?\nHe turned away from the woman that had once given him birth\nAnd cryin' out to the sky, 'cause he was lonely and scared\nBut only the Devil responded, 'cause God wasn't there\nAnd right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold\nAnd so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul\nThey say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it\nAfter that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it\nAnd listen, 'cause the story that I'm tellin' is true\n'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too\nAnd now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go\nIn fact, I'm sure he's standin' among one of you at my shows\nAnd every street cypher, listenin' to little thugs flow\nHe could be standin' right next to you, and you wouldn't know\nThe Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked\nWhite, brown, yellow and black \u2014 color is not restricted\nYou have a self-destructive destiny when you're inflicted\nAnd you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top\nThere's no diversity because we're burnin' in the melting pot\nSo when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never\nBecause a dance with the Devil might last you forever\n\n[Part TII \"I\"]\n\n[Intro: Immortal Technique]\nOh, y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?\nWell, it\u2019s not, you didn\u2019t count on a fallen angel gettin' back\nInto the grace of God and comin' after you\nY\u2019all niggas ain\u2019t shit, your producers ain\u2019t shit\nYour fuckin' A & R ain\u2019t shit\nI\u2019ll fuckin' wipe my ass with your demo deal\nYo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker\u2019s head off!\n\n[Verse 1: Diabolic]\nGo \u2018head and grip Glocks\nI\u2019ll snap your trigger finger in six spots\nYou\u2019ll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots\nI\u2019ll watch you topple flat\nPut away your rings and holla back\nCan\u2019t freestyle; you\u2019re screwed off the top, like bottle caps\nBeneath the surface\nI\u2019m overheatin' your receiving circuits\nBy unleashin' deeper verses than priests speak in churches\nWhat you preach is worthless\nYour worship defeat the purpose\nLike President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service\nBeyond what y'all fathom, I shit on cats and jaw tap 'em\nShow no compassion, like havin' a straight-faced orgasm\nTour jack 'em, have his half-a-10 bitch suck my friend\u2019s dick\nIn the meantime, you can french kiss this clenched fist\nDiabolic: a one-man brigade spreadin' cancer plague\nFist-fuckin\u2019 a pussy\u2019s face, holdin' a hand grenade\nSo if I catch you bluffin', faggot, you\u2019re less than nothin'\nI just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction\n\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nYou motherfuckers are nothin', you cannot harm me\nI\u2019ll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army\nStorm the planet, huntin' you down, 'cause I\u2019m on a mission\nTo split your body into a billion one-celled organisms\nImmortal Technique\u2019ll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch\nYou\u2019re faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix\nI\u2019m 'bout to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chips\nArsenic language transmitted revolutionarily\nI\u2019m like time itself: I\u2019m gonna kill you inevitably\nChemically bomb you, fuck usin\u2019 a chrome piece\nI\u2019m Illmatic, you won\u2019t make it home, like Jerome\u2019s niece\nI\u2019ll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me\nAnd then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy\nThis puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology\nSo you\u2019re nothin', like diversity without equality\nAnd your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology\nUsin' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven\nProduces more digits than 22 divided by seven\nYou\u2019re like Kevin Spacey: your style is usually suspect\nYou never killed a cop, you, not a motherfuckin' thug yet\nYour mind is empty and spacious\nLike the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist\nFace it, you\u2019re too basic, you\u2019re never gonna make it\nLike children walkin' through Antarctica, butt-naked", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6d36e046f448659a1f6dd9e3bc669044.220x220x1.jpg", "album": "Revolutionary Vol. 1", "year": "2001-09-14"}]}
