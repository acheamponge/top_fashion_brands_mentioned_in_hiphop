hurricane\nGive me shelter from the rain\nPlay me some music when a family member dies\nAnd all I can do is hug and crie\nPlay me some music when my woman leaves\nAnd all I have is memories\nPlay me some music when I can't laugh\nAnd IRS takes all I have\nWhen you play me some music for all the illegal stops and eveyone that gets robbed by the cops play me some music while I drink my beers wipe my tears and spread my cheers\nPlay some music music\nMusic play me some music music\nMusic\n\nHaddiesburg Mississippi meber jefferson davis confederate guy used to enslave us  if you don't its cool I
