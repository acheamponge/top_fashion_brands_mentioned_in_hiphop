Go with what makes sense\nSince I know what I'm up against\nWe as rappers must decide what's most important\nAnd I can't help the poor if I'm one of them\nSo I got rich and gave back, to me that's the win/win\nSo next time you see the homie and his rims spin\nJust know my mind is working just like them (rims, that is)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy homie Sig' was on a tier where no tears should fall\n\u2018Cause he was on the block where no squares get off\nSee, in my inner circle, all we do is ball\n'Til we all got triangles on our wall\nAin't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record\nI recall, \u2018cause I really been there before\nFour scores and seven years ago, prepared the flow\nPrepared for war, I should fear no man\nYou don't hear me though, these words ain't just 'pared to go\nIn one ear, out the other ear, no!\nYo, my balls and my word is alls I have\nWhat you gonna do to me, nigga? Scars will scab\nWhat, you gonna box me, homie? I can dodge a jab\nThree shots couldn't touch me, thank God for that\nI'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back\nAnd the whole BK, nigga, holla back!\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2008-08-26", "album": "Volume: One!
