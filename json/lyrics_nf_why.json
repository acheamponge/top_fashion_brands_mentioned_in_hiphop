(Ayy)\nI don't trust the thoughts that come inside my head (Woo)\nI don't trust this thing that beats inside my chest\nWho I am and who I wanna be cannot connect; why?\nDon't think I deserve it? You get no respect (Woo)\nI just made a couple mil', still not impressed\n\"Let You Down\" goes triple platinum, yeah, okay, okay, I guess (Ayy)\nSmile for a moment then these questions startin' to fill my head, not again!\nI push away the people that I love the most; why? (Woo)\nI don't want no one to know I'm vulnerable; why? (Woo)\nThat makes me feel weak and so uncomfortable; why? (Ayy)\nStop askin' me questions, I just wanna feel alive\nUntil I die\u2014this isn't Nate's flow (Woo)\nJust let me rhyme; I'm in disguise\nI'm a busy person, got no time for lies; one of a kind\nThey don't see it; I pull out they eyes; I'm on the rise!\nI've been doin' this for most my life with no advice (Woo)\nTake my chances, I just roll the dice, do what I like\nAs a kid, I was afraid of heights, put that aside\nNow I'm here and they look so surprised, well so am I, woo\nThey don't invite me to the parties, but I still arrive\nKick down the door and then I go inside\nGive off that \"I do not belong here\" vibe\nThen take the keys right off the counter, let's go for a ride\nWhy do y'all look mortified? (Ayy)\nI keep to myself, they think I'm sorta shy, organized\n\"Let You Down's\" the only song you've heard of? Well then you're behind (Woo)\nStory time; wish that I could think like Big Sean does, but I just can't decide (aah!)\nIf I should stick my knife inside of Pennywise\nI, I don't care what anybody else thinks\u2014lies (Haha)\nI do not need nobody to help me\u2014lies\nI kinda feel guilty 'cause I'm wealthy; why?\nI don't understand, it's got me questionin' like\n\"Why? Just tell me why\"\u2014not back to this flow\nInside I feel divided\nBack when I ain't had a dime, but had the drive\nBack before I ever signed, I questioned life, like, \"Who am I, man?\" Woo\nNothin' to me's ever good enough\nI could be workin' for 24 hours a day and think I never did enough\nMy life is a movie, but there ain't no tellin' what you're gonna see in my cinema (No)\nI wanna be great, but I get in the way of myself and I think about everything that I could never be\nWhy do I do it though? Ayy, yeah\nWhy you always lookin' aggravated?\nNot a choice, you know I had to make it\nWhen they talk about the greatest, they gon' probably never put us in the conversation\nLike somethin', then I gotta take it\nWrite somethin', then I might erase it\nI love it, then I really hate it\nWhat's the problem, Nathan? I don't know!\nI know I like to preach to always be yourself (Yeah)\nBut my emotions make me feel like I am someone else\nMe and pride had made a pact that we don't need no help\nWhich feels like I'm at war inside myself, but I forgot the shells\nI hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell\nA lot of people know me, but not a lot know me well\nHold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell\nA lot of people know me, but they don't know me well\n\n[Outro]\nToo many faces, too many faces, too many faces"}], "artist": "NF"}
