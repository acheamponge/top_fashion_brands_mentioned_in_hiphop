Better yet, go get a spaceship\nI'll shoot you to the moon with one boom when the bass hit\nBukkake till your face drips, so go ahead and taste it\nThat's a million children I just wasted, so don't waste it\nThese white girls is wasted, flaky, Space Cases\nThey dropping N-bombs like they racist\nAll day, while...\n\n[Hook 1: Sample from Buckshot on Black Moon\u2019s \u201cI Got Cha Opin (Remix)\u201d] (x2)\nMe and my crew walk the streets at night\nLike looking for the right one, baby\n\n[Hook 2: Sample from Stephanie Mills\u2019s \u201cYou and I\u201d]\nYou and I could be together for all...\n\n[Hook 1: Sample from Buckshot on Black Moon\u2019s \u201cI Got Cha Opin (Remix)\u201d] (x2)\nMe and my crew walk the streets at night\nLike looking for the right one, baby\n\n[Verse 2: Suave-Ski]\nRolling downtown, trying to find another bird\nWatch the whip swerve, observe the suave flow of words\nPull up to the curb, curvy made her curtsy in a summer dress\nUnimpressed, I just want to see shorty come undressed\nCumming on her breasts \u2018cause I heard that cum on the flesh\nIs way better than lotion.  I'm so cunning and fresh\nAnd now that Suave's on the job, tricks slob on my knob\nY'all are frogs on a log trying to swallow pollywogs\nI'm a problem for blogs, bust globs on a blonde\nMake her ass jiggle like fat blobs get a job\nTake some groupies to the movies then to Ruby Tuesdays\nAnd make them do me two ways.  I'm too blazed\nI get away like a ghost\u2014that's how it's supposed to go\nI see it, I want it, I beat it, I'm running\nMan I never ever host these hoes\nI dick 'em, I diss 'em, dismiss 'em, don't miss 'em\nPlay your position.  I'm fixing the system.  Bitches don't listen\nTuck in your lip and quit tripping\nJust strip and get tipped and listen to me ripping this shit\nThe illest to spit.  I'll evict a video vixen out the crib like the rent\u2019s late\nThe anti-Drake, the asshole all your friends hate \u2018cause...\n\n[Hook 1: Sample from Buckshot on Black Moon\u2019s \u201cI Got Cha Opin (Remix)\u201d] (x2)\nMe and my crew walk the streets at night\nLike looking for the right one, baby\n\n[Hook 2: Sample from Stephanie Mills\u2019s \u201cYou and I\u201d]\nYou and I could be together for all...\n\n[Hook 1: Sample from Buckshot on Black Moon\u2019s \u201cI Got Cha Opin (Remix)\u201d] (x4)\nMe and my crew walk the streets at night\nLike looking for the right one, baby\n\n[Hook 2: Sample from Stephanie Mills\u2019s \u201cYou and I\u201d]\nYou and I could be together for all...", "year": "2015-06-30"}]}
