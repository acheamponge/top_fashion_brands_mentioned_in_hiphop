So for me, I wanted to y'know\nI wanted to have a conversation to all my fans, y'know what I'm sayin'\nThat's on the water in the hood doing what they do\nOn that grind every day, cause I know that\nI know what that is, y'know what I'm sayin'?\nAnd who's the grimiest nigga in the street, y'know what I mean?\nDJ Drama\nAnd I mean it's my first mixtape and shit, know what I mean there's more to come, so\nWe 'gon do what it is we gotta do", "year": "2006-04-04"}]}
