Yeah, give it up\n(Ooooh, do it from the bacK) C'mon, c'mon\n(Don't you wanna do me?) Give me some of that coochie coochie\n\nI said \"Come on in\" and \"Oh hi, how ya doing?\"\nConversation was fake, cause I was thinking bout screwing\nShe gave me a hug and a real wet kiss\nZip goes the zipper and I whipped out my dick\nI know you're wondering, what did she think?\nShe got on her knees and started sucking my beef link\nAnd believe me, the head was kinda right, bro\nI got served like a Cutlass in a side show\nAnd the nut came gushing like Niagra falls\nShe took it out and I nutted in her eyeball\nNow what's next, is it time to get some dick?\nShe said she wanted to get licked\nEat the pussy? That ain't fly, no\nI'm not a lick 'em low, Pooh-Man lied, ho\nAll I wanna do is knock some boots\nSo let me see you in your birthday suit\nEvery bone in the cock I was preparing to break\nCause the bitch had a fucking Ms. America shape\nNow it's time for the sticking, watch the bitch get stuck\nBy the big-dick gangsta Banksta and the late-night fuck\n\n(Don't you wanna do me?) Yeah, give it up\n(Ooooh, do it from the bacK) C'mon, c'mon\n(Don't you wanna do me?) Give me some of that coochie coochie\n\nI was chopping up the cock just like a Ginsu\nShe opened up her legs wide enough to ride my Benz through\nThat's about the time I stuck it in her socket\nShe shouted \"Pop my coochie!\" Best believe that I popped it\nAnd I kept on stroking\nBut I couldn't feel the pussy with the old-school Trojan\nI had to wear it last week, I heard she burnt Pooh\nI slapped her ass cheeks til they turned blue\nI had her hanging off the bed with her hands on the floor\nJust like a pro, hitting nothing but pussy hole\nShe started wiggling, I couldn't keep the bitch still\nJust like En Vogue, I'm giving her something she can feel\nI was sweating and dripping cause we was working out\nShe started moaning cause the nut came squirting out\nHuh, now it's time for me to bust mine\nI'm a have to end it and shit, I'm finna finish up this fuck rhyme\nNow I think I had enough\nOh shit, my late night fuck!
