You ask\nThe guy with the razzmatazz with ten duffel bags packed with pazazz\nIn the past cut twice by the ladies of my life\nBoom stitched up by my wife\nWho am I?\nIt's suffice to say found gold in my heart\nPut the ice away\nNicer day, live foul homie it's a price to pay\nEven when it's rainy still I say it's nice to day\nWho am I?\nThat brother with the platinum plaque\nWith the strength to stand and say gangsta rap was whack\nThe fact is that when that brother rap or act\nHold position, front of the pack\nWho am I?\n\n[Tatyana Ali]\nI be fully educated\nNot the one to play with\nAnd I find that some of y'all hate it\nBut you wanna know baby\nWho am I?\nI be fully educated\nNot the one to play with\nAnd I find that some of y'all hate it\nBut you wanna know baby\nWho am I?\n\nBaby if you really wanna know about me\nI'll tell you who I am\nI'll tell you I be not the one for games\nBut if you're right with me\nI know I'll do the same\n\nI be fully educated\nNot the one to play with\nAnd I find that some of y'all hate it\nBut you wanna know baby\nWho am I?\nI be fully educated\nNot the one to play with\nAnd I find that some of y'all hate it\nBut you wanna know baby\nWho am I?\n(L-Y-T-E)\n\n[MC Lyte]\nWho am I?\nYou dare to ask\nThe same female who hailed from Brooklyn and wailed on that ass\nI'm your worst nightmare, you're best wet dream\nBreak the bank papi cause we're coming for the cream\nAnd while I'm in the world ain't none of y'all safe\nHold face, sell a million and you still won't equate\nSo who am I? It ain't hard to tell\nLike staying on track cause you thinking I fell\nSee a lot know my face but a few know me well\nJust who I am is the one to make you gel\nWho am I? The chick that keeps spittin'\nTaking back all my snip that was bitten\nRewritten dangerous laison\nWith the shades on\nMaking sure the track stays on\nDays on end I'll be that one true friend\nThat will always be around when the world falls down\nI'm honest to the bone\nNo question, suggestion\nYou don't wanna know\nI give the truth, nothing less than\nI'm sweet with a heart to fit\nSmart as a whip\nYou feed me well but I'm still hard to get\nI'm like a calculus problem you just can't solve\nStudy me well if you wanna get involved\nAnd even after that I'm still unpredictable\nNow who am I? I'm unforgettable\n\n[Tatyana Ali]\nI be fully educated\nNot the one to play with\nAnd I find that some of y'all hate it\nBut you wanna know baby\nWho am I?\nI be fully educated\nNot the one to play with\nAnd I find that some of y'all hate it\nBut you wanna know baby\nWho am I?\nI be fully educated\nNot the one to play with\nAnd I find that some of y'all hate it\nBut you wanna know baby\nWho am I?\nI be fully educated\nNot the one to play with\nAnd I find that some of y'all hate it\nBut you wanna know baby\nWho am I?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6d35ec81cf7a17dcc359661f467d19b0.899x899x1.jpg", "album": "Willennium", "title": "Who Am I?"}]}
