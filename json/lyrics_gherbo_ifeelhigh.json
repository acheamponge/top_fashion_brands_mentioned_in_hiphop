We want it on sight\nNow them nights, I had all over\nYou want to show us the price\nLot of shit changed, since I got older\nBut you niggas been ho's all my life\nI took control for my bitch in the rover\nI told her it's nothing, that's light\nClutchin' it close like that bitch, in a holster\nI don't give a fuck 'bout your life\nI lost a whole lot of money in life\nI don\u2019t give a fuck \u2019bout this ice\nI lost a whole lot of lovers in life\nI don't give a fuck \u2019bout his fife\nCan't believe how I'm cashing out\nEveryone busy when I was broke\nNow I'm all they ask about\nAnticipated when I got that cake, like I was gonna pass it out\nStill fucking racks up\nNew wheel smacked up\nAll tryna gas it out\nSee us all fucked up\nAshing out\nStill on my grizzy\nWorking my rizzy\nSmoke till I\u2019m dizzy\nStill got the glizzy\nStill back and forth from LA, making history\nStill got to come back, had 2 cribs in the city\nCould've got a .50\nStill holding grudges for Capo\nYou clipped and get killed in the pity\nSmoked in a minute\nWho show up in it\nYou probably hoping you kill me\nHope you know that you goin with me, ayy ayy\nBut I'm with some animals\nDefinitely responsible, you come near me\nStill ain't no fear in me"}]}
