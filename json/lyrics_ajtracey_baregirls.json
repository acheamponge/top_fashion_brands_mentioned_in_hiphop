I own it\nSee the chick that I keep grabbing, her man own it\nIf I never gave you my number, then don't phone it\nBare tings after the pecker\nI've got the tools for the job like I'm Black or Decker\nI made her pussy purr once, after that, I won't check her\nYou wanna see me after that? You've gotta chat to Rebecca\n\n[Hook: Jammz & AJ Tracey]\nWhy?
