Ganja\nMahatma Gandhi in concert before the whole world\nWas conquered by the antichrist, I watched it\nThese problematic mystic nescient narcissistic\nDimwits still obsessed with the way that I spit shit\nYou sitting on the highway stuck\nI get around traffic in a high rail truck with a flywheel clutch\nThe rap music watch dog, Hip hop robot borg\nI got JP Beats on the boards\nWe Rap music watch dogs, Hip Hop robot borgs\nJP headphones got cobalt chords\nSpecial agent Alexander has bad manners\nHe gerrymanders cancer communities, speaking bad Spanish\nAnd since it's now legal, the task force going wild weasel\nThey confiscate drugs from the people\nEvolved from clips and chrome to bone age cone head clones\nWith nano ohms operated headphones\nBack in the day I used to order chicken parmigiana\nAt the Mondrian and have a sunset seance\nShe put a nice n\u00e9glig\u00e9e on\nA soft mink bed spread, we could both lay on and just talk\nShe flirting, combing through her hair with her own fingers\nI wouldn't expect her to know those lyrics\nShe can't wait to get the album, it downloaded 500 thousand\nShe says I'm the King of Crap Mountain\nFor me to sell out, that means somebody gotta buy in\nNobody bit the bait Bis, try again\nConfirm life is real, the wound too deep to heal\nA man like that does not want to feel\nThey say I'm too old to rap, six minute mile laps\nI'll stop when I'm too old to do that\nI work for three shifts of eight then I'm out the gate\nI post haste forthwith before I walk away\nI been the worlds leading rap manufacturer for quite some while\nDon't even trip when they bite my style\nI want the whole world to upgrade, humankind struggle to this day\nMany survived the double digit age\nBut the mortality rate everywhere is not the same\nPromote life after life like St. Germaine\nRhymes, reasons, signs, times and seasons\nThe latest in line with unprecedented achievements\nWe all know what these was, bees where the bees get buzzed\nMy super bug is immune to the drums\nWatch him howl at the Moon, the son of a bitch, half baboon\nHe got a wrap around serpent tattoo\nHe sent floods and radiation to poison our blood\nHe deceived the whole world to destroy our love\nHe has no color, he doesn't see the other as his brother\nEven though he knows we need each other\nHe's a animal that walks upright with a fucked up love life\nHe can't even get a hug for the night\nIf you see me with my teeth fixed, that means I'm rich\nIf your teeth is fucked up it's cause you sucked my dick\nTalk to the Comms chief, he asked, \"What's the status?\"\nWe got to survey the fire lit caverns on Saturn\nWhen we landed in a damaged flight cabin\nI got out and saw a hexagonal pattern, walked over and grabbed it\nThe co-pilot was dead holding a picture of his kids\nIt would be insensitive to say he wasn't meant to live\nI walked forty clicks the from the edge of the A Ring\nCrossed over the Encke divison, Molybdenum bridge\nThe creature I saw, a cross between a pig with the face of a squid\nAnd fine hairs like an Arachnid\nIt said, \"If you gonna stand there and stare\nYou might as well walk over here and yank my beard if you ain't scared\"\nI've seen enough I gotta get back to where to I live\nFrom that place of abundance called the Dyson sphere\nI moved to the U.S. when I was two years old\nI've paid taxes here so long, this is where I call home\nThe spectre metrics edit is exceptionally impressive\nSyndromic tornado Tourette's but what's that?\nShow mercy upon my soul through proper governance and goodwill\nI am your obedient servant still\nWe are consumed by war, slave class martial law\nBlood red like the plateau on Mars\nI will live, love, learn and try not to burn\nFor one day soon the golden one shall return\nIf we discern and work hard to earn, get what we deserve\nThe golden ones return, it's our turn\nFreedom of press means you getting too nosey\nGet sentenced to death 'cause those were some senseless steps\nLet the rooster take care of his biz, let the hens lay eggs\nLet the hard working people make bread\n'Cause we don't want much, we just want what we want\nYou act like we had a choice, like you didn't set us up\nIf you can't stand the sound of your family's moans\nThen you need to get over there and bandage those bones\nSqueaky wheels get oiled, silent frogs sit there and boil\nAll refrigerated items might spoil\nAny knowledge is not good knowledge\nUnless you gain enough knowledge to emerge from the darkness where it all started\nTill the light sparketh, manifest itself and departed\nNever to return but yet still a part of it\nDo you comprehend that? Say that last part again\n\"I was busy watching football again\"\nThe power cut off again, on again, off again\nIt's the end of the world but let's all pretend\nIt was just an awful dream, can't even express what I mean\n'Cause I don't even know what I seen"}]}
