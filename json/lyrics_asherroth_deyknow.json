Yaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!\nOh yeahhh! Oh my god yeahh!\nThis is awesome! Soo awesome! (Yaaaahhhhh!)\nCANNON! (CANNON!)\n\nThey know me, this yo I spit like a little kid\nRap thinks I?m a dirty hippie?icky\nHarry potter, don?t you try nothing tricky\nMuggles befuddled by my?wizardry\nPancake ?misery? of all any beat\nI am instinctively syncing my energy\nWith the high heavens\nSecretly developing a brand new pedigree, specialty, a better me\nI essentially, must defeat what is left of me?the evil me\nMay you rest in pieces\nRecently deceased, I believe that world peace is\nEasily in reach if religion is decreased. Eh\nG-G-G-Gs!\nI don?t believe in Jesus\nDoes that mean that I am a DEMON?\nCouldn?t God and Allah have the same meaning giving someone something to believe in?\nCuz these days, between the T-Vay and what I read, I don?t foresee a brand new way\nOf living in the U-S of A\nDo us a Fay-vor?I think we need to smoke some WAAYD!\n\nYes! Excuse me waiter, where are my capers?\n(Forreal, I don?t wanna be a pain in the ass but I wanted capers on this salad YEA BOI!)\nAnd we act (we act)\nLike they know (like they know)\nBut it?s clear (it?s clear)\nThat they don?t (that they don?t)\nSo we bitch (yeah, we bitch)\nAnd we moan (and we moan)\nAnd won?t switch (and won?t switch)\nTill we vote?and pick a new leader for the new year\nYES WE CAN! Did you hear? That?s the new cheer\nTwenty-twelve. Did you hear? That?s the new fear\nSo, oh well, roll a blunt, get a new beer\nAsh be the truth?sorry yo, I?m new here\nDid not introduce me\nI am so rude-arrrrrogant shoes, hell yeah they be a new pair. (good grief)\nHell, oh well, tell me who cares\nWho dares to play musical chairs with the fair-skinned Farrah Khan of hims?\nI am sit-ting, sticking my ?one dick in? writtens\nA Maryland terrapin, American lyricist with a pen, they call me a terrorist cuz I can embarrass the top ten. I guess I am Clark Kent. Ash Roth, uh, add me as a top friend", "year": null}]}
