The record you are about to hear contains. Heavy bass, thick drums, crisp highs, low lows and strong gospel lyrics, which may cause you to reflect on all the stupid things you did in your whole life. Remember when I told you not to smack your grandma in the back of the neck her dentures fell out and the cat peed on it. Remember when you super glued you sisters hair to the flag pole. Awe man, remember when you stole those Heavy D concert tickets you went to the concert you stood in the front row he stage dove off the stage right on top of you and nobody helped you catch him. Remember that time when you spit in your homeboys taco from lookin at your girl funny in the second grade. Remember when I told you to stop drinkin and drivin you get in a big ole accident you lose one one of your legs and now we can't even kick it man think about your life think about what your doin\n\nTbone:\nYo Tech Tech wait wait man hold on I think they got your point bro\n\nKing Tech:\nI'm sorry man, and now back to the record"}], "artist": "T-Bone"}
