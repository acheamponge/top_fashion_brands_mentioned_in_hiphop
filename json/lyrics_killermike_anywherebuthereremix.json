(Atlanta)\n\n[Hook]\nLet the city peel away right from under you\nThere are too many clouds in this town\nI can hear them calling out to me\nI can hear them calling out\nAnywhere but here\n\n[Verse 3 \u2013 Chamillionaire]\nYou know there\u2019s so many ways in the streets to get money\nBut it\u2019s plenty more ways you can die\nWhen you get to the sky, tell the Lord I said hi\n\nI rap behind tint through my city, like that H-Town Diddy\nCheesy cake\u2019ll make em walk more than a mile\nThe paper chase got embedded in our heads\nBut don\u2019t let it get it twisted, they might kill you with a smile\nAnd you can say it\u2019s a pity in the city where they\u2019re really killin\u2019 us\nProlly the city that\u2019s in style\nSee we promote that foolish, then they go and rep to it\nAnd we act like we didn\u2019t notice how\nYou see the young gettin\u2019 younger but they tougher\nChopper tucked behind the buckle \u2018til they pull it like pow\nJust \u2018cause the turf where you steppin\u2019 or the people you was reppin\u2019 with\nJust wasn\u2019t who you should\u2019ve been around\nNever caught him by his lonely, he got homies with homies\nAnd he think they\u2019ll be the ones to hold him down\nBeen watchin\u2019 First 48 and actin\u2019 like he can\u2019t relate\nYou know your friends the first to snitch on you on trial\nSit down"}]}
