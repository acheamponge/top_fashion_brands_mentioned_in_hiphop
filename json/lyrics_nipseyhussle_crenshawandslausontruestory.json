"Crenshaw", "year": "2013-10-08", "lyrics": "Look, relate to you, I can't if you's a fake nigga\nWhere Level 4 in the state what your mistakes get you\nRap niggas, they just wanna double date with you\nTwitpic and show these hoes that they affiliate with you\nLabels used to treatin' rappers like a slave, nigga\nStarvin' artist, \"Just be happy with your fame, nigga\"\nShit changed, now it's such a different game\nAll the niggas like myself is controlling everything\nIf you, pay attention see exactly what I mean\nFuck the middleman, I said that in 2003\nWas 18, White Lincoln, chrome feet\nBlack .40 was my pillow, every night I go to sleep\nGrown niggas treat me like they OG\nHoldin' on to every word that the tiny loc speaks\nI had a vision that nobody else could see\nSold my shit to D-Mac, a little less than 10 Gs\nBrought my grocery bag of cash back to Blacc Sam\nHe matched a nigga, next day we went to Sam Ash\nWe bought a Pro Tools and a microphone\nStudio was far from plush but them lights was on\nCouple hunned thousand stashed at my mama's home\nReal estate in Atlanta, but ain't nobody know\nMac 11s in the safe, hidden in the floor\nMy bro did it like nobody that I've ever known\nScreens on every wall with 16 camera angles\nDouble pane bulletproof glass pushin' past the haters\nCuban links and Rolexes, fold a check from Epic\nThis industry ain't gotta like us but they gon' respect it\nBuilt the label up from money we was savin' up\nNo details 'til the statute of limitations up\nCouple niggas got flipped tryna play with us\nThe demonstrations speak loud so I ain't sayin' much\nWas a charismatic nigga, I don't play as much\n'Cause life is real when you live it in a place like us\nSchool pictures crackin' smiles, now my face is stuck\nShell shocked to see how much they really hated us\nCouldn't keep a kind heart, get yo' hatred up\nStreets smarts, nigga, get yo information up\nWatching Belly, smokin blunts, take Jamaican puffs\nOne day I'ma have a house and car like Jamaican cuz\nCredits roll, back to stress pound breakin' up\nHad to fight before we hustled, and it made us tough\nEarly '90s, neighbor's rooster used to wake us up\nMama had a bucket and a shack but we ain't make a fuss\nBlue Cutlass, no license, .380 tucked\n'96 Caprice 'Bolt Da Fatts' was savin up\nThey gettin' packed out if niggas try fade with us\nCrenshaw and Slauson, True Story, Zo, play the drums\n\nPART 2\n\nI got to this paper, no industry favors\nSpeaking to they soul, so they tell me I'm they favorite\nBeen through it myself, yeah, I know how it make you\nNever let 'em judge you cuz they ain't you\nI could tell a long story or just say I'm grateful\nI could tell a gang of reasons or just say I'm faithful\nI can sell a million records or just mixtape it\nThey don't really give a fuck long as I just keep pacing\nQuiet for a year, gave no explanation\nNow I'm 'bout to drop, I got 'em on that Proud 2 Pay shit\nHalf of a million cash, he gon' offer me a label\nTold him that I need to own it, so I'm cool, kept it gangster\nHolla back, real niggas what you calling that\nYou see the game fucked up, look, what part is that\nThey compare where I'm at to where I started at\nThey put me in the Getty, I'm a artifact\n\nThey can't never hang me on the wall, though\nWe presidents, nigga, we push buttons\nThe rest of y'all just react\nVictory Lap, nigga, this Marathon\nStill don't stop though\n\nCount me up, count me up\nI'm in this shit, you niggas is out as fuck\nI'm used to people doubting I'd amount to much\nI thrive off the challenge, I'm a childish fuck\nI love toys so I'm by the buck\nI hate to lose so I play too rough\nI speak my mind and say I say too much\nMinus the hip-hop, cops say I don't say enough\nI know they listening to my raps\nWhile I'm out running these laps\nTryna make my paper stack\nIt's like this and like that\nI think I'm KRS\nI think I'm dead prez\nI think I'm 2Pac, nigga, I need some fuckin' meds\nI think I'm Eminem, I'm going crazy\nShoot in front of the shop, Nas & AZ\n\nI never planned to make it to a old nigga\nPlant the bag, 560 off a zone, nigga\nDip my Giovanni feet in chrome nigga\nDrop them bitches on Pirellis, hit the road with 'em\nI should get the cover of the Rolling Stone, nigga\nI should perform at the Old Republic or Rome, nigga\nI'm not a rapper or a poet, I'm a poem, nigga\nAin't it amazing how I'm standing on my own, nigga?\nAlways pull up in foreign that's never loaned, nigga\nAlways speaking my music straight from my soul, nigga\nMy business partners Jewish but I'm all nigga\nStill ghetto that ain't wrong is it?\nWay I see it long as I ball, nigga\nI'm a California don, nigga\nHundred thousand on my car, nigga\nYou know very well who you are, nigga\n\nPART 3\n\nI been that nigga before the fame happened\nThat tell them hoes go get my name tatted\nI rock a Roley 'cause my game classic\nAnd repped L.A. before it came back in\nI know y'all see me in my lane smashin'\nI know y'all hate me with a strange passion\nI made examples out y'all lame asses\nI love my life, y'all could hate that shit\nAll the smart money got they bets on me\nAnd all them real niggas wish the best for me\nAll these bad bitches got some sex for me\nShout out them bad bitches getting dressed for me\nThey down to stand in line 'cause it's well worth it\nPull up to my shows in Chanel purses\nThey jeans fit the worst but they smell perfect\nNever argue with they niggas but they yell verses\n\nAy, I'm true to this game\nGimme that pussy 'fore she tell me her name\nAy, I'm true to this game\nAll Money In No Money Out on my chain\nAy, I'm true to this game\nNo guarantees, you gotta live for today\nAy, I'm true to this game\nDo it big 'til they remember your name\nHustle\n\n[Break]\n\nAy, I'm true to this game\nGimme that pussy 'fore she tell me her name\nAy, I'm true to this game\nAll Money In No Money Out on my chain\nAy, I'm true to this game\nNo guarantees, you gotta live for today\nAy, I'm true to this game\nDo it big 'til they remember your name\nHustle\n\nWe still them same niggas that we used to be\nBlacc Sam in that sedan in the coupe is me\nHundred thousand for the car so the roof was free\nWhile I'm in it flashback on how it used to be\nWildin', nigga, can't relax, it was the youth of me\nThat make a smoker buy the bullets for a shooting spree\nFound myself, same time family losing me\nBut all that violence from the past is what produced a G\nAll the real L.A. niggas know the truth is me\nNo hotline, homie, I could tell your future free\nGet on your Marathon 'til you bruise ya feet\nOr run the streets 'til the reverend write ya eulogy\nFishbowl in the six with all my jewelry\n'Cause I heard my haters is supposed to be shooting me\nI'll never let a broke bitch influence me\nSlauson Ave, getting money and the proof is me\n\n[Outro]\n[Suge Knight]\n'Cause I tell everybody all the time\nOwn your masters, own your catalog\nCan't none of these niggas say they own their masters and their catalog\nIf they do, they're lying to you\nOr they gon' say own some of it or they gon' buy it back\nAll that is bullshit\n\n[JAY-Z]\nJust had to get our little thing together\nWe picked up distribution\nNow we're strong, now we're legit, naw'mean\nAnd we're a force to be reckoned with right now, word up"}],
