We wouldn't kill Bill Clinton\nWe was more interested in finding where the pith is\nAt nightfall, in dazing places\nSmithsonian Museum of Air and Space\nAnd while you're mourning\nMe, I'm never crying\nYour legacy is living cause to me you're never dying\n\n[Hook: Freddie Bunz & C-Rayz Walz] * 2\nYou can live every second of the day having fun\nOr you can be pissed, never get anything done\nYou can celebrate life\nOr you can want death\nI'd rather celebrate\nCause in the heart she never left\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nSeeing J in 2000 (?)\nThe first time I seen him\nAlmost went heat-to-heat at the Fat Beats freelance (?)\nI know I speak on behalf of the Rotten Appleists (?)\nAnd for many soldiers from Minnesota, Minneapolis\nThe Leaning Tower of Pisa you bought slices for fans\nBudweisers in hands, looking like you in the band\nI'm at a loss for words, with no Scrabble\nBut I'm glad you beat Technique in the Fat Beats (?) battle\nI thought it'd be me and you, same at Blaze\nTen years later, still got flavor, daze\nFreestyle leaders, follow the spark\nTo understand The Many Faces of Oliver Hart\nFrom the Fifth Element to the first rapper who staged(?)\nTo urban plaza(?), getting hype off rage\nRhymesayers forever, every verse is a blessing\nAbilities manifest, we on earth for a lesson\nYour vocal's a Moghul (?), no wonder\nInstead of a cell, you gave me your home phone number\nSo when I heard news of your passing, I called up Kathy\nLike, \"Ma, what happened?\"\nAnd she confirmed the truth of strange factors\nHeadshots couldn't explain the brain fractures\n(That night (?))\nIn my mind every time I rhyme you've always been\nNow you gotta trade verses with time, divine flim (?)\nSo tell the Father: The sun is still shining\nLiving light, cause a bright Eyedea never dies\nMr. Larsen, you left the mic molested\nThe truth of real talk, this ain't no deep confession\nDope on the whole, so I know it's peace you rest in\nOverloading the flow 'til the beat's congested\nFirst Born\nAs I mourn feeling torn By the Throat\nOn the Carbon Carousel, I forgot what I wrote\nThis Is Where We Were, you're where we all gotta go\nFace Candy, sad face (?), happy clowns on the low (?)\nNo joke, this is The Some of All Things\nYour advice: When in Rome, kill the king, like Larsen\n\n[Outro] * 2\nYou could count every star in the sky at night\nLive by the tongue, die on the mic\nInfinite Clock Ovens (?)\nTime's never done\nAll apart we come together as one to celebrate"}]}
