Night\nHave you ever been to heaven at night?\nHeaven at night\n\n[Verse]\nHave you ever been to heaven at night?\nClosing your eyes, the feeling so right\nAt first you might see just one bright beam of light\nClutching your soul to the toll of the bright\nHappy unites and feelings take flight\nBlind to the evils, you give them no sight\nFocus on floatin', your focus is tight\nLike you rewrote an essay for a class, to pass in the night\nHave you ever seen an ending so nice?\nYou feel so free, like you're high as a kite\nLike how you feel if you drink some Bud Light, followed by Jag\nModels who smile, then tilt their head back\nThese are a few of the visions I like\nMixed in with light, these are my favorites to dream in the night\nThis is my heaven at night\n\n[Chorus]\nHave you\nEver been to heaven at night?\nHeaven at night\nOh, have you\nEver been to heaven at night?\nHeaven at night\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nMan, oh\nI need what the world can't give me\nCan't give me\nMan, oh\nI see what the world can't show me\nCan't show me\nDawg, oh\nI lack what the world can't give me\nCan't give me\nDawg, oh\nI sing it but the world can't hear me\nCan't hear me\n\n[Bridge]\nHeaven at night\nHeaven at night\n\n[Chorus]\nHave you\nEver been to heaven at night?\nHeaven at night\nOh, have you\nEver been to heaven at night?\nHeaven at night"}]}
