To say your prayers\n'Cause I don't think that you gon' be able say 'em later\n\n[Hook]\nI'm so scared of the light (I'm so scared of the light)\nThat's why I only come out at night (I only come out at night)\nI love to howl at the moon (I love to howl at the moon)\nKeep your kids outta sight (Keep your kids outta sight)\nOr they'll be eaten tonight (Or they'll be eaten tonight)\nI love to howl at the moon (I love to howl at the moon)"}]}
