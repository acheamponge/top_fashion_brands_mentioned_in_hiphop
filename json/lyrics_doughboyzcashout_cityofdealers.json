Not from me but my nigga official had a connect when YG came and needed a pistol\nWanna cop me a 50 I just need it for issues but niggas wanna see us down signing papers with initials\nUsed to be on Sussex peeping out the window\nJust woke up but still dreaming bout a Benzo\nSnapped in reality a nigga hearing gunshots\nNothing new it's just that one block\n\n[Hook]\nRaised in the city of the dealers and the hood full of killers keep the bullshit I just want money\nSo I hit the block and I got my own money\nWas only 21 playing with grown money\n(x2)\n\n\n\n[Verse 3: Roc]\nI got a message to deliver I demand to be heard\nBefore I got locked up I was on my way to a bird\nIt started from flipping grams, niggas was doing scams I was catching a sitting off I'm a blessing I been a boss\nMy presence had niggas still tryna get out a Dodge\nWhether I just be by myself or the whole entourage\nWhen my face tore up you better know I mean business cause in the next couple seconds my 40 gon start spitting\nI get love from my city\nBest believe niggas know me\nAnd I got a black [nigga] he gon fosho kill for me\nReal talk I got bands guy\nLawyer you on stand by\nCoupe muscle 22's ice got a nigga cool\n[?] got a nigga tatted up from head to chest\nA sticky situation show what friends the best [?] to the left\nI got stripes like a ref\nPlay in the D and it's death (Play in the D and it's death)\n\n[Hook]\nRaised in the city of the dealers and the hood full of killers keep the bullshit I just want money\nSo I hit the block and I got my own money\nWas only 21 playing with grown money\n(x2)"}]}
