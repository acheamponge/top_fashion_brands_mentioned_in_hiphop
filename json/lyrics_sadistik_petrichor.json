Burroughs in my hands\nI burrow with my hands on a burrow in the sand\n'til it's purple and collapsed from the digging\nSearching for a path to the virtue that I had\nSurfaces will crack from the circles that I've ran in the city\nCity of the Living Dead wishing they could live again\nRip me into little shreds I'm filthy\nAdmitting all my differences drifting into bitterness\nKiss me 'til I'm innocent and kill me really\nI feel rosy two pockets full of poesy\nI'm nosy that's too obvious for Cody\nToo cautious just to hold me like the cigarette I lit\nJust to get another hit when new monsters can control me\nAnd it's an arcane parlay but hearts aren't really heart shaped are they\nI don't really know why but today is different from the last\nI don't want to waste no time in wishing it would last\nI can feel it in my skin hidden in my laugh\nThat this moment doesn't seem like a symptom of the past\nI'm alive skipping by a land mine softly\nShip is gonna capsize probably it's okay\nI'll make my own way that's my hobby\nI don't want to be a sad eyed zombie with no brain\nAnd that means that I'd pay-pay no mind of grate-grateful times\nAs days-days go by and leave\nRather lead a grace-graceful life and say-say no lies\nAnd take-take both sides of me\nI've fallen into more pieces than are countable\nBut put 'em back in a sequence that amounts\nI'm fiending for an out that can set me free from writer's block\nI keep forgetting to remember everything that I forgot\nYea and they say when it rains it pours\nI'll splash in puddles when I know I can't evade the storm\nI'll burn another bridge just to make it warm\nThen I'll throw myself inside, watch me burn myself alive\nThis is a witches hunt zip it up lips are shut\nIf I run quick enough then I'll come into some\nSymptoms of innocence when it's crushed into dust\nIf I wasn't in love with it just give it up\nI'm feeling cold and under pressure\nAnd hide my nervousness with silence\nBut when a coal is under pressure\nThat's when it turns into a diamond\nI've been in front of the line of fire to hold still\nWatching all the people that try to bite through my stone will\nDon't cross the bear with your beef or a cross to bear\nYou either take the higher road or be the road kill\n\n[Talking: Sadistik]\n\nOn September the first 2007, I learned what it's like to feel the world collapse beneath me\nTo free fall for so long that you forget what the ground ever felt like in the first place\nAnd the only thought you do have, is that when you finally land you hope it's hard enough that no piece of you will be discovered again\nYou see..\nI watched my hero die that day my friends\nAnd so far I have survived every day since\nI have no choice but forward while being gnawed on by the birds of prey\nPraying that I never have to take another step in the same direction\nI am the deliverer of ashes\nA cultivator of roses in my fathers name\nAnd while I missed the pieces of myself that have been killed by my own hands\nI celebrate the ones that I have created since\nI have reinvented myself more times than I care to count and each one is a little less beautiful than the last which leads me to here, the now\nThe culmination of every moment of my life and I want nothing more than to tear every piece of my flesh off one by one to show you what's been hiding underneath\nBecause these are the flowers for my father", "album": "Flowers For My Father"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
