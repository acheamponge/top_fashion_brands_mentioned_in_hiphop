And why did he think that it was so vital\nTo remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible\nThey say Hell is underground, Heaven is in the sky\nThey say that's where you go when you die, but how they know?\n\nI've been to many churches, I've quoted many verses\nI've dealt with my base self, I controlled my many urges\nI used to study my lessons, that was a blessing not a curse\nI found out that heaven and hell exist right here on earth, word\nStudied with Rastafarians, found out from the dreads that hell\nIs called Babylon and that's where the crazy boarheads dwell\nThey got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs\nBut real muslims believe in paradise and resisting Shaitan\n\nSo it all sound the same to me\nBut when they say one's right and the other is wrong\nIt just sound like game to me\nIt's like God skipped past the church and came to me\nNo that ain't vain to me\nIt's just a particular way that I came to see\nThe difference between those that claim to be\nReligious and those that say they spiritual\nAnd recognize that life is full of miracles\nYou can see the flow is divine\nI glow when I rhyme\nCause it coincide with a growing tide\nOf those looking for God that know to go inside\n\nLooking for absolution\nLiving in mass confusion\nThe gas inducing psychopath created a last solution\nBased on his interpretation\nOf what the words are saying\nLooking for God but ended up doing the work of satan\nReligion create division\nMake the Muslim hate the Christian\nMake the Christian hate the Jew\nMake up rules of faith\nThat you condition to and gotta follow\nGod forbid you go to Hell\nBut if you ever been to any ghetto, then you know it well\n\nPeace"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
