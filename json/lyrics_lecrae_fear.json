Your rod and your staff they comfort me\n\n[Verse 1]\nI honestly grow insecure as I get older\nCause even when you hot there comes a day when you get colder\nComes a day when you slower\nTime is takin' it's toll\n45 on the back of the jersey upon yo' soul\nI'm scared of letting go\nI don't know what the future holds\nMy nightmares are having nightmares\nI'm quite scared of what's right and fair\nHow I fare an eternity\nWill I hear well done when He turn to me\nWill I hear you care too much 'bout all of this stuff that really don't matter\nYou chased the wind and you won it\nGot to the top of a two foot ladder\nWhat's after I can capture all this mess my heart was after\nWill I end up empty handed when I stand before my master\nDid I master the mathematics of a passive disaster\nAdding my selfish ambition all the while subtracting what matters\nI don't know\n\n[Chorus: Lecrae]\nLate nights I can't sleep\nWill I fall\nWhen I peek through the curtains all I see, fingers pointing at me\nAnd they watching, and they watching\nAnd I'm wondering what they thinking, thinking 'bout\nAt late nights I can't sleep\nCounting cash, counting sheep\nThrough the curtains all I see, fingers pointing right at me\nAnd I'm watching, and I'm watching\nAnd I'm wondering\nWhat they thinking, thinking 'bout it all\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn high school we tried to act all tough\nI remember a couple times I couldn't back that up\nLike when I ran from them vatos\nScuffin' up my zapatos\nScared of losing my hide\nI was so embarrassed inside\nIf I could go back in time\nI would stand and say something like\nI ain't never scared, never scared, never scared\nI'm lyin' I'm scared of these thoughts in my head\nI'm scared of possibly pushin' people right over the ledge\nWhen I said I pledge allegiance to the struggle\nThen I turn around and buckle under stress and under pressure\nBible on my dresser that could teach my pain a lesson\nBut I'd rather not address it\nAddress is in depression\nI'm scared if I confess it\nThat you gon' look at me like I'm somethin' less\nAnd I'm such a mess\n\n[Break]\nCelui qui a peur d'admettre ses craintes\nEst celui qui ne pourra pas les surmonter\nOn trouve la libert\u00e9 dans la confession\nEt la libert\u00e9 dans la reconnaissance\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd it just so happens I'm wrestling with my status\nI'm tryna see me like He do, not focusing on this madness\nThey count on me count me out\nOn account of they fear and doubts\nKeep account of my wrongs\nTrying to keep me inside they house\nSome just keep me around\nGotta wonder what that's about\nYea, they wanna be politically correct I suppose\nBut I'm comfortable in my skin while they just pretend in they clothes\nI'm scared of falling and failing in front of all of my foes\nAnd I feel some friends are unfaithful\nSo I keep my small circle closed\nI don't want no handouts or favors\nNo functional saviors\nI'mma tell that truth 'till it kill me\nAnd I'm chillin' with my Creator\nJesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus to all of my haters\nFor the ones that think I forgot Him\nAnd the ones who won't let me say it\nI ain't scared no mo'\n\n[Chorus: Lecrae]\nLate nights I can't sleep\nWill I fall\nWhen I peek through the curtains all I see, fingers pointing at me\nAnd they watching, and they watching\nAnd I'm wondering what they thinking, thinking 'bout\nAt late nights I can't sleep\nCounting cash, counting sheep\nThrough the curtains all I see, fingers pointing right at me\nAnd I'm watching, and I'm watching\nAnd I'm wondering\nWhat they thinking, thinking 'bout it all\n\n[Bridge: Natalie Lauren]\nEverybody always\nThey gon' have something to say\nWhether you like it or not\nEverybody always\nThey gone have something to say\nBaby, don't take it to heart\nSomething to say\n\n[Outro]\n\u6050\u6016\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u5165\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3082\u306e\u306f\u3001\n\u305d\u308c\u306b\u6253\u3061\u52dd\u3064\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3002\n\u5168\u3066\u306e\u3082\u306e\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u5165\u308c\u305f\u3068\u304d\u3001\n\u81ea\u7531\u306f\u5b58\u5728\u3057\u3001\u6050\u6016\u306f\u89e3\u304d\u653e\u305f\u308c\u308b\u3002"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
