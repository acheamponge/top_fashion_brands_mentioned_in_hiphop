AH-HA! AH-HA! AH-HA!\nYo, Yo, Check it!\nI dedicate this piece to my peeps who roam the streets\nGod bless their soul, may they each rest in peace\nThere's those who finance and those who choose to lease\nWhatever suits you, whether on a term of your lease\nDifferent strokes for different folks, GOD!\nI refuse to going back to being broke, LORD!\nHe got struck with lightning he got hit, HARD!\nFaces twenty like two maximum\nHis whole life was scarred!\nThe Preacher's Son and I, came off the Santa Maria\nTen case amount of, then caught the diarrhea\nWhole load of Refugees on the aircraft carrier\nSome say Dirty Cash?
