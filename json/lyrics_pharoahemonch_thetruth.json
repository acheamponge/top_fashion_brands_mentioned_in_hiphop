Time did\nWe find kids speaking 'cause it's naturally in us\nBut the false prophets by telling us we born sinners\nVenders of hate got me battling my own mind state\nAt a divine rate, I ain't in this just to rhyme great\nSee the truth in the thighs of a stripper, the eyes of my nigga\nIf it's only one, then why should it differ?\nSo constantly I seek it\nWondering why I gotta drink a six-pack to speak it\nTook a picture of the truth and tried to develop it\nHad proof, it was only recognized by the intelligent\nTook the negative and positive, 'cause niggas got to live\nSaid I got to give more than I'm given\n'Cause truth'll never be heard in religion\nAfter searching the world, on the inside, what was hidden?\nIt was the truth\n\n[Chorus: Female vocal]\nTruth, truth, truth, truth, truth, truth\nIn due time, we will find\n\n[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]\nCheck it, on my neck I still got marks from the nooses\nThe truth it produces, fear that got niggas on the run like Carl Lewis\nThe truth is my crew is the smoothest spitters of saliva juices\nLike The Roots is, more organic than acoustics\nHeavenly, what will set you free and kill you in the same breath\nThat shit you gotta get off your chest before your death\nUnless the way you speak is lighter than a pamphlet\n'Cause the truth give the words the weight of a planet, god damn it\nI ran with what God planted in my heart and I understand it\nTo be to bring some light to the dark, breathe some life in this art\nThis must be the truth (Why?)\n'Cause we keep marching on (True)\nThe truth lay the foundation of what we rocking on (True)\nYou can't see it if you blind, but we will always prevail (True)\nLife is like the open sea, the truth is the wind in our sail\nAnd in the end, our names is on the lips of dying men\nIf ever crushed to the earth, we always rise again\nWhen the words of lying men sound lush like the sound of a violin\nThe truth is there, it's just the heart you gotta find it in\n\n[Chorus: Female vocal]\nYou will find, you will find, you will find\nYou will find, you will find, you will find\nYou will find", "year": "1999-10-19"}]}
