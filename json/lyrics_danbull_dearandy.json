It seems pretty mean to me\n\nIt's a useless tactic using Wootton Bassett\nAnd with such a blunder, no wonder you're viewed as a fanatic\nI hate to be rude, but the fact's clear and loud to me:\nYou could use some class, Mr. Choudary\nHow many people do you think you're going to convert\nWhen recently you've seemed to be a bit of a berk?\n\nMost of these are just kids, they're not the warmongers\nThe decisions are made by politicians, they should face your criticism\nThere's better ways to raise awareness of Muslims' plights\nLike look at Lowkey, he's doing something right\nHe self-released a song for Palestine and Gaza\nAnd now the track's reached number one in the Amazon charts\n\nAnd people are listening, taking it on board\nAnd not retaliating with hateful scrawls on Facebook walls\nIt takes some balls to spread a polemic message\nBut it takes brains to ensure everyone gets it\nI want to see these countries free from military and killing\nI want to see stability\nSo if your protest goes ahead, I hope there's no stress\nBut don't be surprised that in the people's eyes you're hopeless\n\nDan Bull", "year": "2010-01-05"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
