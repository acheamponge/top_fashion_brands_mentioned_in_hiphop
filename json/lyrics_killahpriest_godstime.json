Or should I take the carpenter's role?\nIt's dark in this hole, that's as far as it goes\nHarps of gold, impossible, pot as a rose\nRemarkable soul, the resistance, instincts intakes a poisons\nThe devil's enjoyment is so annoying\nExploiting, morally destroying\nAround a flag their serpent's coiling\nMy spirit's boiling, it's simple\nIf we sin don't do it again, ask for forgiveness\nThis privilege saves us from max in their prison\nAttraction of wisdom, not this plastic system\nThe faction, we victims\nThe aspen is venom, relax and it's your ending\nFamilies deprived of their lives\nThe archives, lost tribe, pork rinds\nBut it's a new era, a new beginning\nA new ending, a new time, only a few inches\nWe getting closer, you choose, you make a decision\nNo collision, turn off the television\nThe Hell in women eyes and males we like we failed the mission\nIt's disciplince, militance, no tolerance for the ignorance\nWe live again, refuse to lose, spark minds it's God Time\nEvery bar in this line is stars aligned\nTurn on the searchlight, see we the owners of the birthright\nReverse the curse like we sold the drugs that's owed to us\nLet's get what's owed to us, what's really owed to us\nWe bust the guns when we was young\nNow it's change a higher plane, the sky is in my range\nThe third, I have wings\n\n(Hook) Priest"}]}
