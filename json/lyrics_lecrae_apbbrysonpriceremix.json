He gone\nYou seen 'em? He gone\nYou seen 'em? He outta there\n\n[Verse 1: This'l]\nBefore you heard about Jeezy, boy,\nI was already on some trap-or-die,\nWas a goon, before it was cool\nYou can still see the pain in my eye\nWhat you know about sitting in a jail cell, felonies, murder case,\nBest friend, rolled on me, take the stand, turned state.\n\nI am a felon, I tell no lie, hand on the Bible, head to the sky\nI want to live, I ain't wanna die\nwhen they roll upon me\nlet them bullets fly\n\nIt could have been the end though,\nOne way, hell's gates\nbut the Lord stepped in,\nChose to show grace,\nCoulda been layed in a box dawg\n6 of my homeboys carry me\nbut I'm alive and the old me gone,\n'Cause everyday dawg I bury me\n\n[Verse 2: Lecrae]\nThose who knew me be like \"who he?\",\nthey're trippin off the new me,\nThey like, \"Man, where the old Crae, you're crazy, you can't fool me.\"\nI would party so hard that the law tryin' to find me\nI pray to God they ain't find me.\nBut then I hear a {whoo-whoo}\nLook up in the rear view and they are right behind me\nRoll down my window,\n\"Boy, what's your name?\n'Cause you was doing 85 in the passing lane with no traffic, man\"\nThen I gave 'em my ID,\nguess what they say,\n\"This boy here crazy, nah, that's just Crae\"\nMayne I was psycho, wild as the hun is\nI do like the Chi, doing whatever I wanted\nUntil I was confronted, heard about Jesus and I changed\nThey like, \"Man what you do?\nTalkin bout 'you just ain't the same'"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
