my dayyy!\nAll the punk muh'fuckers who ain't feelin' that\nGet the fuck outta my way\n'Cause I'm intoxicated\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nDrink, drink (hey!)\nDrink, drink, drink (hey!)\nDrink, drink, drink (hey!)\nDrink, drink, drink, drink, bitch!\nDrink, drink, drink (hey!)\nDrink, drink, drink, bitch!\nC'mon everybody let's get..\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne x2]\nIntoxicated!\nI've been told I can still stand on all ten toes\nIntoxicated!\n'Cause I been throwed\nWhen I'm in funk, nigga, I didn't fold\nIntoxicated!\nI've been told I can still stand on all ten toes\nIntoxicated!\n'Cause I been throwed\nWhen I'm in funk, nigga, I didn't fold\nIntoxicated!\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nHill billy bar is the route\n'Cause not too many know what me bein' a star is about\nI ask for Hennessey up at this bar and it\u2019s out\nSo I told my homies \u201cfuck it, I got a bar in my house\u201d\nFull of whiskies and wines\nMixes, full liquors and bitches and pine\nWe smokin' 'stead of Sid Vicious-ing lines\nIf you the bartender this is the crime\nServin' me a margarita, I get a heater if it's missin' the lime\nDrinkin' Caribou plus\nI swear if you fuss\nWe added pineapple slices, even more flare when you fuck\nHave 'em [?], intoxicated, get a little pop inflated\nSprite and Moscoto, then add a bit of vodka to get you rocked and faded\nHave you contemplated\nHow you gettin' home this spot that's overpopulated\nWith lots of ladies\nThat's wit it and sex is non-debated, and none of 'em is ovulatin'\nMy na na puh wah wah dated was..\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nIntoxicated!\nI've been told I can still stand on all ten toes\nIntoxicated!\n'Cause I been throwed\nWhen I'm in funk, nigga, I didn't fold\nIntoxicated!\n\n[Verse 2: Txx Will]\nWalk up in the party, chicks throwin' me their pussy\nTold her later, now little bitches on me, the pussy\nI can turn down bitches like that, it ain't nothin'\nEven though she owe for two nights of flat-back fuckin'\nIf you lookin' for me, you can find me where the bar's at\nIntoxicated, inebriated, don't know where the car's at\nI started drinkin' 'fore I came here tonight\nBlazin' blunts back to back, so I came feelin' right\nLookin' for the right chick to put this thing in her life\nAnd if a nigga wanna trip, it ain't a thing, we can fight\nWe can party, we can fuck, or we can kick it\nOr we can tear this motherfucker up, you dig it?\nEither way, it don't matter, 'cause I'm with it\nI'm beating something the fuck down, do you get it?\nIf a nigga stepped quick, he get slapped quick\nThen I pull the next chick, take her to my house and watch Netflix\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nI've been told I can still stand on all ten toes\nIntoxicated!\n'Cause I been throwed\nWhen I'm in funk, nigga, I didn't fold\nIntoxicated!\n\n[Verse 3: Big Scoob]\nDrinkin' since the sun came up, or 'fore it went down?\nNo tellin' man, I'm drunk as fuck, that's how I gets down\nAnd I'm about to fight or fuck, after this next round\nBig fella like a monster truck, be knockin' shit down\nThey hate it when my villains is deep, and we in the building\nWe keep 'em deep in their feelings\nWe drinkin', cheefin', and chillin'\nI'm clutching, touching the Ruger\nAnd practice active as shooter\nThe whisky make me ruder, so I'ma blame it on the liquor\nBig fella drinkin' and trippin\nMy phone bangin', I'm missin'\nI'm laughing, mackin' these bitches\nAnd I fucking these snitches\nI'm rowdy, wild, and aggressive\nA bar brawler, the best-est\nI'm hooded proof, and I'm tested\nIntoxicated profession\nThe top dog in my section\nMy balls is hangin', I'm flexin'\nI'm way past the jeffin'\nWhich one of you bitches sexin'?\nUndressin', blessing my brethren\nBitch, bust it open and get it\nAn average night when I'm present\nYou're more than welcome to test it (Bitch)\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nI've been told I can still stand on all ten toes\nIntoxicated!\n'Cause I been throwed\nWhen I'm in funk, nigga, I didn't fold\nIntoxicated!\n\n[Verse 4: Bakarii]\nI'm strictly business, I got paper on my speakerphone\nI seen her booty, I said \"Baby what you drinkin' on?\"\nI'm sippin' Bailey's, plus the R\u00e9my try'na creep up on\nBut I never stumbled, I just rolled up a bubble clone\nAnother shot, let me get the mob up in the b-b-block and\nWe put her puffin, plus I'm countin' on them panties droppin'\nBut don't mistake me, fake me, 'cause I'm mackin'\nI grip the milli, really, peel it back and\nMore than a rap song, bubble on my Motorola\nThey got them straps on 'em, they ride around the corna'\nThey got the axe on 'em, tippy on my tippy toes\nThey got the max on their backs, out to get you gone\nIntoxicated, we just faded, get the swisher gun\nWe cop a fifth, and tip it back, and puff another one\nWe in this bitch, all them other niggas' overrated\nYou in the presence of them dogs, nigga\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nIntoxicated!\nDrink, drink (hey!)\nDrink, drink, drink (hey!)\nDrink, drink, drink (hey!)\nDrink, drink, drink, drink, bitch!\nDrink, drink, drink (hey!)\nDrink, drink, drink, bitch!\nC'mon everybody let's get...\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne]\nIntoxicated!\nI've been told I can still stand on all ten toes\nIntoxicated!\n'Cause I been throwed\nWhen I'm in funk, nigga, I didn't fold\nIntoxicated!\nI've been told I can still stand on all ten toes\nIntoxicated!\n'Cause I been throwed\nWhen I'm in funk, nigga, I didn't fold"}], "artist": "Big Scoob"}
