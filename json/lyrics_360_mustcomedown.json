Still\nIt\u2019s my life I\u2019m not giving it away\nI\u2019m sure these people hanging around who I can\u2019t trust, but fuck it, Let's toast of success\nCelebrate it;  couple more fucking faded\nI could stay here all night hoping to get a little bit more high\nOff a payment that all came\nFrom having a bit of foresight\nAnd I\u2019m just trying to make my way through all that ego\nHaters taking shots, you stave them off and then they reload\nNo point trippin\u2019 off of people that I never met\nFinally realising that this life I got is Heaven sent\nWith opportunities a lot of people never get\nIt\u2019s gone by so fast and I'm just trying to keep a level head\nYeah\n\n[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]\nI\u2019m coming down from the most natural high\nFeet on the ground\nI\u2019m coming down from the most natural high\nFeet on the ground\nWhat goes up, must come down\nAnd I'm counting on it\nI stay close, to the ground\nSo I don\u2019t go too far\nWhat goes up, must come down\nAnd I'm counting on it\nI stay close, to the ground\nSo I don\u2019t go too far\nSo I don\u2019t go too far\nSo I don\u2019t go too far"}]}
