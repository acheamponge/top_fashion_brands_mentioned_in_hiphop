I guess when I was smoking that shit\nSuitcase money and a bedroom full of bricks\nI smacked fathers and brothers for fronting\nBut I never hit no sister or mother for nothing, respect\nI know where the bodies lay low\nIn places where most men are scared to go\nBut I won't turn states on records and tapes\nSo the secrets will stay all the way to my grave\nI took weight from London to Japan\nAnd returned to Murderpan still the man\nDon't get it twist by the jewels and whip\nMost of my life, I hustled for material shit\nFuck what you thought, I'm far from rich\nBut when that day comes, I refuse to switch\nBut you'll be gunning for me then\n'Cause I got two more years to outlive my sins\nI like puddin on some DL shit\nBut I never swung dick to a Porky-The-Pig-looking bitch\nFor me, I do what work\nAnd if it don't work, then I return to do dirt\nMy word\n\n[Hook: Scratches by DJ Premier]\n\"Now get low when I do dirt\"\n\"I do a lot of dirty shit\"\n\"Dirty\"\n\"I advise you to tell us where the cash is\"\n\"Now get low when I do dirt\"\n\n[Verse 2: Smiley The Ghetto Child]\nI keep dirt in my drawers, got the four in the draw\nI was filthy on tour, robbing rich for the poor\nUptown to score from the papi store\nAct like I brought the soda, but it's really the raw\nIn them dirty pins with trifling gents\nSome niggas rob their moms just to get a hit\nDirty lawyers, dirty cops, even scheme on plots\nYou can pay a filthy judge just to skip and leave town\nI ain't underground, I'm under the underground\nWith worms and germs, where the fire don't burn\nI pollute my lungs like a Russian sun\nYeah rats in subways, dirty gun trays\nI'm dirty like the corner that's infested with the rest of it\n'Cause God never blessed it, my lungs stay congested\nI'm filthy like the [?] when your ass get arrested\nAnd dirty like a gun with no member when I test it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Hannibal Stax]\nStraight out of Brooklyn where we get to them, hustling\nScrambling through boroughs and states, no escape, trapped within my actions in\nLearned to do dirt when y'all was learning how to backspin\nBlew shots at niggas for the love of how the barrel spin\nCheated on my girl 'cause bitches found me attractive\nBy the age of 13, I was heavily crime active\nNow I travel the path that's narrow within\nBut wear my frown, throw that upside-down devilish grin\nStill looked at as the crook that sneak the metal in\nOnce even poisoned my own fam in the effort to win\nDown my regrets in [?], poker bets, and gin\nLet's not talk about stress, I don't know where to begin\nAll I know is when it came to ends, I robbed an old time friend\nRan to him recently and made amends\nBut if worst comes to worst, I'ma rob him again\nIf it's work, I'm getting dirty, I meant no need to pretend\nFuck the bullshit\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Big Shug]\nOne thing I hate is some straight fake motherfuckers who really ain't got no idea on what's real\nSo they're living a fantasy world and they think that's what it's all about\nBut they don't really know what's really real"}], "artist": "Big Shug"}
