This is uh, 360, AKA captain 6 dog, AKA Tommy 6, AKA 60 Cent, AKA 360 Mafia, AKA Dirty Love {PEZ laughs}. And you\u2019re listening to the Hip Hop Sphere \u2013 What You Hear Is What You Buy mixtape. Downloadable mixtape for all the net-heads and shit it\u2019s to sort of promote the album which is called What You See Is What You Get, which is out March 22, 2008 on Soul Mate Records (Cop that shit). Um, you\u2019re gonna hear some unreleased exclusive shit that isn\u2019t gonna come out anywhere else except here, so there\u2019s a lot of old shit, there's this bit of newer shit and there\u2019s some real heat in there. There's also two exclusive tracks off the album that you can\u2019t hear anywhere else except for this. And um, if you go to my Myspace which is www.myspace.com/emcee360 , so that\u2019s E.M.C.E.E.3.6.0., you can hear the two singles off the album, they\u2019re up, streamable now, and you can watch a music video as well, and you can look at me, which is a fuckin\u2019 privilege. Uh also, there\u2019s a track on this thing called \u201cFallin\u2019 & Flying\u201d, it\u2019s with GMC. It\u2019s off GMC\u2019s mixtape - The Three Letter Mixtape: Volume G, and uh, he\u2019s signed to Solid State Recordings, and G\u2019s probably one of my favourite MCs in this country or musical artist in general, and um, he kills shit, so make sure you cop that fuckin\u2019 mixtape as well. Also, PEZ\u2019s solo album A Mind Of My Own is coming out soon after mine, and it is crazy. Crazy original and the main single's featuring me too, so that\u2019s more incentive to buy it, bitches. Hiphopsphere.com. Yeah, make sure you cop the album What You See Is What You Get in JB Hi-Fi and Sanity around Australia and your independent stores as well. And uh, yeah, check us out, baby. We\u2019re gon' fuckin\u2019 smash it. We\u2019re gonna fuckin\u2019 smash it! Smash it! Smash it! Peace"}]}
