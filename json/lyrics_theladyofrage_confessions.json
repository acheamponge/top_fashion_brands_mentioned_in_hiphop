(singing), Lady of Rage (talking):\n\nAmen\nA-Men\nAmen\nA-Men\nAmen\nA-Men\nAmen\nA-Men\n\nHey God, can you hear me?\nCan you see me?\nI can see heaven there\nLet me see, what's wrong with me\nHey God, come take a walk with me\nHey God, come have a talk with me\nHey God"}], "artist": "The Lady of Rage"}
