He took his sin\n\nHe was told \"get in the boat\"\nAnd so he climbed in\nNow a fisher of men\nNow with his pen\nTo give you a picture of Him\nWhen he rhymes man\n\nHe's been forgiven more then x10\nFor Him, he's been livin' with all his time spent\nWith a purpose he's been given until his life ends\nHe found life when\nHe was lifeless\nNow his life 's His\n\nA man stood in the pulpit\nTold 'em what  Life gives\nHe bowed his knee in the bedroom\nNow his life lives\nHe was born again\nNow because of that life gift\nThat's the truth\nIt changed what his life meant\n\nNow, he's sent\nHe's got a story to tell\nA man on the radio has a story as well\nHe said, \"I rather scare you into heaven\nThen lull you to hell!\"\nHis eyes have seen the glory of a soul that is well\nSo thank you Dr. Rogers\nThough, you never got to meet\nA fifteen year old kid who was lost in the streets\nHis life was changed by the words that you speak\nThat fifteen year old kid\nThat kid was me"}]}
