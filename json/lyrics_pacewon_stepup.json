Yo, yo. \"Step up, nigga\"\n--Step Up-- *echoes* All them niggas out there\nTellin on all them niggas violatin STEP UP\n\n[Verse One]\nYo, yo; from the Himalays to the pyramids of Egypt\nPace Won flow is dumb as Forest Gump weeded\nLynch Mob's, Hit Squad's then I freak with\nMore Golddiggers than E or PMD did\n(Ha!) Word like so many hoochies on my penis\nBy the time I'm twenty-nine I have more Suns than Phoenix\nWatch the man bust, pose for the cameras\nAnd have reporters running/back like Barry Sanders\n(Yo!) My habits is spray paint (tsss) and rap fresh\nPace Won gets more bank than NatWest\nWalkin round thinkin which face to slap next\nLike Latifah my Wrath is Madness\nHo-ha, more smooth than Billy D\nDrinkin Colt 45 eyes slant like Phillipines\nServe the baseheads, my raps kill the fiends\nThat wanna MC but don't know what it means\n\nChorus:\nPeople wanna act large but can't take charge\nI tell em --Step Up-- *echoes*\nYo, yo; Kids ask me for advice Pace on how to be nice\nI tell em --Step Up-- *echoes*\nYo, yo; If I see your sister cryin or fallin behind\nI tell her --Step Up-- *echoes*\nYo, yo; If you don't need your teeth and your crew want beef\nThen you can --Step Up-- *echoes*\n\nYo, yo, Bring em all, yo-yo\n\n[Verse Two]\nSince my small days always been real\nWith raps thats more fat/phat than that ass on Kim Fields\nI'm roastin roaches, poets think I'm Moses\nPartin oceans, people feel me like emotions\nA poet and truth, I roll with the jewels\nVoice of the youth (uh) one a ya diehard boys that'll shoot\nKeep my rep up, rappers want somethin tell em --Step Up-- *echoes*\n\nChorus\n\n[Verse Three]\nYo, yo; You look soft, I hook off and kick butt\nAttack like Hitler, if your boys weak avoid me like I was thicker\nRollin with the rich kids\nSlick like the mac of the year, I know bitches\nThey bite you, scratch you, kick you in the groin\nA two-headed coin that be makin people point (look)\nAnd talk soft, but I walked off, I'll remember\nDefender of my people, makin legal tender\nGot it made, no more goin to court now\nI'm out doin the world while my brother hold the fort down\nHe said, \"Pace slit the wrist if the cross you\"\nWhen your hands are tied, you're only doin what your forced to\nDon't hate the Pace Won just cause my records sellin\nFind a playa hater and I tell'im\n\nChorus", "year": "1998-01-01"}]}
