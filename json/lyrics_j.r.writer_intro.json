A.R\nB.k.a. \"Who are you? You ain't on my radar\"\nGet it? This my play-yard, and I don't want these pawns around\nPlay hard, I play you out -- listen, this my stomping ground\nI want the crown even though that I'm a champion\nYou still buying Champions; shit, I'm from Lionel Hampton\n130th, burning piff with the burner grip\nI don't need a burner to murder this -- I just murder it\nI know you heard I'm sick, or if not, you heard I'm sick\nAnd yeah, the flow from outer space, but I'm earthing this\nHow you sold grams? You ain't never served a brick\nIt's like you got no hands -- you ain't got a bird to flip\nI'm from the murder strip, hood life shady\nNah, I wasn't born a rapper -- the hood life made me\nBut lately, I've been in the hood like crazy\nPut red marks on your head, you'll look like Baby, baby\nI am great, skipping on the race\n730, but what I meant it's twenty minutes late\nNiggas reckless, give the kid a break\nScott Tissue records, I'm shitting on your tapes\nBut hey, I'm still lamping, Lex with the grill dancing\nStill scrambling cause yes, I'm a real champion\nOf course, come mess with a real cannon\nYou thought I fell off, well welcome to Still Standing\nWriter!"}], "artist": "J.R.
