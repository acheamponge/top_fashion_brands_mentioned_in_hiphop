that\nA lot of y'all niggas just be talking just to talk\nBut you see where I'm from\nI mean\nWe do shit a little different\nA Boogie Wassup!!\n\n[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]\nYou can tell me this and you can tell me that\nBut I don't give a fuck and nigga that's a fact\n'Cause the fakest niggas say the realest shit\nThen the realest niggas say it after that\nAnd now I'm running down with some black sweats\nA black hoodie and some black boots\nA ski mask with a hat that match\nSo that's black on black on black on black on black on black\nAnd bitch I'm running down\nMatter fact I used to fuck with niggas that go back to back on me in situations\nLike if I get hit up then my niggas quick to let that MAC attack\nAnd now I'm going down\n'Cause where I'm from you either clap the ratchet or the ratchet clap at niggas that be actin'\nBetter have it on you 'cause I got it on me I ain't havin' that\nAnd when I come around\nI ain't playing no games with them\nFuck a PlayStation 2 K's hit 'em\nIf he call 12 let the gauge hit him (Let the gauge hit him)\nIf you catch me riding shotgun that mean I got one\nAin't no competition fuck 5,4,3,2 bitch I'm top 1\nI be with a couple niggas from the city\nYeah them niggas gritty\nPockets lookin' kinda Puffy\nCall me Diddy 10's,20's and 100's 50's\nI need everything even 1's and pennies\nI need Meagan Good to let me suck her titties\nI need OVO to sign me for a milli\nNiggas need to know that they ain't fucking with me\nIf you looking for me you can come and get me I'll be waitin'\n\n[Hook: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]\nYeah, That's word to my F yo I ride for this shit (I ride for this shit)\nThem niggas I rode with they ride for they shit (They ride for they shit)\nThem niggas I roll with is trying to get rich, when we rich\nPull up on every bitch that ever fronted when we ain't have money\nNow I ain't got time for this shit\nLadder on me like I'm climbing and shit\nIn my bag like I'm shopping and shit\nBlood with me like he poppin and shit\nBatman with me like we Robin and shit\nZip 'em up like I'm bodyin shit\nGloves on like we boxing and shit\nFuck it tho I ain't got time for this shit\n\n[Verse 2: King Ceazar]\n(Yeah, yeah)\nWhat would you do if I passed the assist\nMost of my life we can't manage this shit\nTryna be a preacher and a pastor and shit\nWonder when I die what happens after this shit\nI got into a fight and had a box cutter try to leave a nigga like a pizzeria\nIt was 12 AM and everybody sleepin' now I'm in the crib doin' Santeria\n'Cuz I need them Benjamins\nLook to the people, tell David let him in (At Night!)\nThe rockers of ganja (Oooh)\nWe got the shit that be breaking the glass like it's opera\nTats on my skin the ink it was there\nBut I love the fucking pain nigga\nSmoking so much weed a nigga can't even see think I'm fucking going insane nigga\nAddicted to paranoia (let's go)\nThis is a sign of creativity\nLike I'm looking in the sky then I wonder why damn weed really hittin' me\nForget about the hate and the pain and most of all all the misery\nAnd it's a mystery\nTo get the 4 kids and the dog to try to figure me lil' nigga\nStoic Stoic\n\n[Hook: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & *King Ceazar*]\nYeah, That's word to my F yo I ride for this shit\n(I ride for this shit)\n*(Yeah, yeah)*\nThem niggas I rode with they ride for they shit\n(They ride for they shit)\n*(Yeah, yeah)*\nThem niggas I roll with is trying to get rich, when we rich\nPull up on every bitch that ever fronted when we ain't have money\nNow I ain't got time for this shit\nLadder on me like I'm climbing and shit\nIn my bag like I'm shopping and shit\nBlood with me like he poppin and shit\nBatman with me like we Robin and shit\nZip 'em up like I'm bodyin shit\nGloves on like we boxing and shit\nFuck it tho I ain't got time for this shit\n\n[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]\n1090 'til my time go\nShoot on sight won't be no combo\nLike Ibaka keep that 9 tho\nTony Parker, bitch I'm Rondo\nI can't do no 9 to 5 no\nMove that work just like I'm Alpo\nI would never drop a dime tho\nPut that on my nigga Quado\nFuck around and crack a shell I ain't talking snails treat a nigga like a lobster\nIf my nigga need that bail money I ain't got it then I'm playing cops and robbers\nPut a nigga under\nI ain't even fronting\nNigga I ain't stutter I'll fucking pop ya\nOnly time you hear a stutter when that choppa bust and it go ba-ba-blocka\nOn some real shit wanna know when the last I fucking cried nigga?\nAfter niggas killed my bro Quo they just left him in the store to die nigga\nThat's the reason why my niggas carry heats and always keep it on the side nigga\nKing Ceazar, Trippy Rell with my nigga Flair YFN those (ha!!)\n\n[Outro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & *King Ceazar*]\nI ain't got time for this shit *(no, no)*\nI don't even got time for my bitch *(no noo nooo noooo)*\nYFN in this bitch\n*Yeah yeah*\n*Let's go*"}], "artist": "A Boogie Wit da Hoodie"}
