Alexander Wang\nBuy new clothes everytime I sell a whole thang\nMoving that coca and I ain't talking 'bout butter\nI leave it to my young niggas, they gon' cook it and cut up\nThey take it back to the block, they break it down, make it pop\nTrapping is not like selling records, it is not gonna flop\nTouch my mans and get dropped, touch my fam and get popped\nTouch my stash and I'm clickin', clockin', reload and then flock\n(Brrrrrrrrrrrrrr) I ain't never had a damn day job, nigga\nI been getting paid since tenth grade, nigga\nNever been in Feds but I make seven figures\nThat's the reason why these niggas wanna hate, go figure\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nHop up out the Porsche or out the Lamb'\nThat become my wrist juggie juggie, flip, juggie juggie, damn\nMy shotta got a Glocka, it go ham\nAll because my wrist juggie juggie, flip, juggie juggie, damn\n\n[Hook]\nI'm the plug (Birds)\nI'm the plug, I'm the plug\nI'm the plug (Birds)\nI'm the plug, I'm the plug\nI'm the plug (Cuckoo)\nI'm the plug, I'm the plug\nI'm the plug (You ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home)\nI'm the plug, I'm the plug", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7be5d53bb88364ffd8db37ac60d9a14f.600x600x1.png", "album": "SubTRAP", "year": null}]}
