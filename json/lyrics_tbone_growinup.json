And diamonds\nAnd thank the lord\nHe blessed me with the gift of street rhymin\nI remember growin up\nAnd all the things we went through\nI remember all the struggles and pains\nWhen no one cared you were there\nGave me hope and you answered my prayers\nI remember all the struggles and pains\nI remember growin up\nAnd all the things we went through\nI remember all the struggles and pains\nWhen no one cared you were there\nGave me hope and you answered my prayers\nI remember all the struggles and pains"}], "artist": "T-Bone"}
