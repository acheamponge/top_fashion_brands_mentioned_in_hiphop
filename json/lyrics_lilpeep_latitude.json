Why, why am I this way?\"\n\n[Chorus 1]\nAin't going nowhere, with that attitude\nI can't find anyone that's like me at this latitude\nAin't going nowhere, with that attitude\nI can't find anyone that's like me at this latitude\nGoing nowhere; when I'm mad at you\nI can't find anyone that's like me at this latitude\nGoing nowhere; when I'm mad at you\nI can't find anyone that's like me at this latitude\n\n[Bridge]\nTalk to me this time, she said\nJust talk to me this time\nFuck me right here baby, fuck me\nHold me this time, she said\nJust talk to me this time\nFuck me right here baby, fuck me\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAin't going nowhere, with that attitude\nI can't find anyone that's like me at this latitude\nAin't going nowhere, with that attitude\nI can't find anyone that's like me at this latitude\nAin't going nowhere, with that attitude\nI can't find anyone that's like me at this latitude\n\n[Outro]\nTalk to me this time, she said\nJust talk to me this time"}], "artist": "Lil Peep"}
