Catch a stain, all we know is gangbang\nWhat you gon' do if I front you a couple of them things? (What you gon' do?)\nBlock hot, leave the spot, gotta have patience\nDidn't know what a bando was 'til we said it's vacant (Bando)\nOne point two, I cash out in casinos out in Vegas (One point two)\nGive me my cash and money, my nigga, no time for no wait (No)\n\n[Verse 1]\nAll my fingers achin' (Achin')\nI'm in love with faces (Faces)\nNiggas pump-fakin' (Pump)\nAnd I remember faces (Faces)\nI've been through the phases (Phases)\nLet me out the cages (Cages)\nHeard that you was slavin' (Slavin')\nMinimum, your wages (Wages)\nI'm on front pages (Pages)\nMy pinky ring your savings (Savings)\nHope you don't think I'm flexin' (Flexin')\nMy necklace, your checkings (Checkings)\nI am an investor ('Vestor)\nSo I make investments (Cash)\nPlain Jane got me talkin' proper etiquette (Proper)\nYour main thing say she faithful, she with all the shits (All the shit)\nI might take a startin' five, make 'em sit that bench (Sit down)\nMake me grip the whole fire, 'cause I see you're tense (Tense)\nI done steal some cookies off that planet, still dense (Cookie)\nCodeine, I drank the last drop, I can't leave a drip (Lean)\nI poured a four, the glass top, jumpin' off the cliff (Lean)\nPoppin' big shit and we jumpin' out the VIP\nNiggas jumpin' out their skin, got you runnin' out your flips (Run)\nI'ma get that bread, like potato, I want chips\nSuck that, bitch, it's still head if she let it touch her lips\nFast car's fast, I might drag, then I drift (Fast car)\nI'm here for the cash, get that bag, then I dip (Bye)\n\n[Chorus]\nFast lane, nigga, soul chain, drippin' real fame\nWhole gang geekin' on the plane like it's Soul Plane\nWhat's your name?
