Shit, I ain't sweatin it\nApathy, hands down, king of Connecticut\nAh-yup, and all my tri-state neighbors\nCause when the East is in the house \"Oh my God,\" danger\n\n[DJ scratches: repeat 2X]\n\"Now I'm gonna show you how the East coast rocks\"\n\"Let me show these cats what rockin the mic's about\"\n\"Now I'm gonna show you how the East coast rocks\"\n\"I represent the East baby that's where I'm from\"", "year": "2006-03-21"}]}
