I ask you\nAlways, the love lords? I need you\nCan you open your heart to mine and accept me and all my faults\nDuring the human course activity, watch me give me my room\nI am radiant, give me my space, I am light\n\n[Verse 1]\nYo, 2/27/98 I wrote a check out\nTo H.W. funeral home for my little sister Christina\n15 years old damn man this fuckin world is so cold\n8 months before I had to do three years\nComing from the air port my face burning with tears\nI had this black cloud hovering over me\nFar back as I can check back down my family tree\nIts been with me since my first LP\n2nd LP I was sittin in court\n3rd LP I was trapped in the belly of the beast, got it back to the streets\nBy the power of the mind and positive of light\nSome say livin is death and dying is life\nI say pray for me that I should be born tonight\nI remember roaming the streets in those cold winter nights\nLook at me this is my life\n\n[Hook]\nSuddenly my life feels so alone, tell me what the hell is going on\nTell me, tell me, why my life feels so alone, so wrong\nTell me what the hell is going on\nHelp me, please help me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI can't even begin to explain the mental anguish\nI went through as a child when I heard my pops had passed\nI went to see him on the sick bed\nWith my grandmother, that day I knew it was the last\nI loved him but I had to grow up without him\nOver the years I've lived through frustrations and questions\nIn 90' I went to jail as an adolescent\nThen in 92' my moms had to go back to the essence\nGot me thinkin about the meaning of my existence (I lost my best friend)\nI realised the devil was spying on my from a distance\nHe don't want me to receive my blessings he fear me\nMy family suffered more deaths then the Kennedy's\nThis is real and if you don't believe me ask someone that grew with me\nKnow them and feel my energy\nPlease never fabricated nor duplicated so I ask you\nCan you open you hearts and minds and receive me with all my faults\nCan you open your hearts and minds unconditionally to begin to understand my cause\nHey yo this world is a pool of sharks\nBut I'm the animal right when I stand up for myself and bark\nAnd this year I gotta go all out for it\nI've been hustlin for 13 years, nothin to show for it (I mean nothin)\nLookin over my bills damn they eaten me up\nEntertainment task force watchin so what the fuck\nI paid my taxes too fuck you and your uncle\nThe laws of nature will see me through\nAnd yeah I peep it and naw it ain't no secret\nHow niggas give their word with no intentions to keep it\nI'm givin you the roots of the real\nMy emotional feelings bi-polar is how I feel\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Keith Murray"}
