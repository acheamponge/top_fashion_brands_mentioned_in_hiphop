How can I pay the rent?\n\n[Verse 3]\nI need to help with breast cancer\nHope this bracelet on my wrist brings an answer\nI'll walk a thousand miles if it brings forth smiles\n3000 BC, the Egyptians described cancer\nSo why we ain't got an answer?\nThe most common form of cancer's on the skin\nIt might affected your friend\nCount Basie, Bob Marley, Peter Falk, Walter Payton\nI'm waiting for that budget, for them big funds\nSo we can cure our loved ones\nSave the babies, the seeds\nThat's what the world needs\nLet's explore needs\nThe Race for Life could save a life for your mama\nI hope this strikes a nerve\nBut in the news we concerned with guns and purp\nHave you ever been to Ronald's House?\nTake your family there", "album": "Love, Hell or Right"}], "artist": "Sadat X"}
