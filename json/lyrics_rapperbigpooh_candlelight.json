Eazy\nThe most known unknown can't see the\nBottom line or even the in-between's\nUntil it's all done, my nigga, I'm talking Queens\nThings is uneasy when you switching up the scenes\nBetter stay inside that fence where the Astro Turf's green\nYeah, this is what they call boom-bap\nWhere they try to figure out what's in that backpack\nGold chains like I'm bringing Slick Rick back\nNo aim, extra clips for that black Mac\nNeither, one time for the believers\nWho wonder why my name ain't burning up, catching fevers\nIt's better than being mourned by the grievers\nWe on our 'Pac and Dre shit, they can't see us\nI'm in all black and brown, the provider of the sound\nNiggas reign and we never been crowned\n\n[Hook: Rapper Big Pooh and (Teddy Pendergrass sample)]\n(Turn off the lights)\nAnd light a candle\nGod gave you just enough for you to handle\n(Turn off the lights)\nI understand, oh\nNiggas try to put a trophy on their mantle\n(Turn off the lights)\nAnd light a candle\nGod gave you just enough for you to handle\n(Turn off the lights)\nI understand, oh\nNiggas need role models, here's a sample\n(Turn 'em off!)\n\n[Verse 2: Marv Won]\nKillers, you rappers is so flaky\nNigga, you can love or hate me, it won't break me\nDon't respect what you build and your foundation's shaky\nOutfit ain't worth a penny and that's word to J.C\nSo, go on ahead and retell them lies\nHow your man got butter and now he sells the pies\nKeep talking, nigga, yeah, detail the prize\nI need to see dough for the biscuit, heat, swell and rise\nBang, like a Maury dame, the story changed\nNiggas was big shots until Robert Horry came\nNow they Corey Haim's\nLook, nigga, either you gonna shit or get off the pot, it's seems poorly trained\nCaptain Jack Sparrow, I'm running a tight ship\n25/8, ain't no day or no night shift\nI want a pretty girl with a mouth just like a vice grip\nYou ain't never seen 2 fat niggas like this\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
