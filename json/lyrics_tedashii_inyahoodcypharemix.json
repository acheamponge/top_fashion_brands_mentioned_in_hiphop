Slaves to sin, you ain't seeing a change, the reason is plain, you ain't bow to Jesus' name\nLook we ain't got no time to slack boy, this here is major, that's why we bring the truth in trap form without the paper\nSo you gon see us posted when you look on the block, I'm a hustler I want your hood hooked on that rock (I got that rock)\nYeah that's right fam I'm rolling with Jesus whose body was broken up like B2K group\nCome on and shake loose like a Winans track, cause you're useless without your life and the Vine attached\nSo get connected with the truth dog and mash with that, cause without Christ it's hard to breathe like a asthma attack\n\nWhat it do, what's the deal, what's good? We saints, we scholars, we hood\nWe use Alpine and Fosgate to preach Christ, bang it in your speakers He fits any stereo type\nWe stay seeking His face plus our fellowship's deep, I couldn't survive just giving God one day a week\nYou would think I was from the farm and not the city streets, by the way that boy from Cali just love to feed sheep\nThey ask me why I do this, I got hits in my head, nails hitting His wrists, the gospels hitting the dead\nBut there's too many emcees and not enough preach, but if you wanna do more than rap then call Reach\nBut if you just wanna rap then call Diddy, you can make his band, catch cheesecake and run the city\nWe keep it FOTU til the day that He come, gotta call Christ the Son cause He shine like one\n\nWe back in ya hood, aw man\n\nWe in ya hood and we can't stop running, the clock's on, so get your boots laced and keep your socks on\nCause shorty still off on the ave with the Glocks on, and yeah they still banging them heads like rock songs\nKids getting grown and they doing profane things main, sinners still sinning, they doing the same thing\nIt seem kinda hard out here on a main vein, we preach God's truth in order to change things\nThe world still passing away, we passing the phrase, no, not passing a daze by passing a J\nNaw you can find us preaching Jesus passionately, and if you ain't using that microphone then pass it to me\nCause I rap, but some I folks don't do that there, lot of em behind the scenes like who that there?\nThey still preach Jesus while they do that hair, take orders sell shoes yeah they do that there\nWe ain't supposed to stop running dog we after the prize that won't bend break or rust or perish with time\nWe ain't chasing the wind naw we chasing to win women and men and tell them Christ erases they sin\n\nAw naw ya'll done messed up and let us in ya hood again, and my hope is to get you back where you shoulda been\nBack with the Father the fact is we falling we don't combat them we used songs to get at them\nAnd despite all their chatter and their whoopty whoop, we want you looking at the stratus like a roofless coupe\nBecause the Lord's coming back like those zootsy suits, but we caught up in ourselves like a bougie nupe\nWe fight a toothless brute who would confuse the truth and keep you going all in circles like a girl's hoola hoop\nSo we behoove the youth getting all in your area, accept the Christ because the fall's getting scarier\nWe bury ya now at 12 years instead of 80, that's 68 so from 6 to 8 before the dash meets the date we get it in in that 10 trying to get them in\nThat's why we all up in your hood like some spinning rims"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
