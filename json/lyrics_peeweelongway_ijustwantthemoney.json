Mayo like I play for the Bucks\nSlam dunking from the A to the Gump\nGood clean came in, went and criss crossed them\nHit with the beater watch it come back\nYou ain't seen a nigga face in the trap in a while\nMust've thought I fucked up ain't coming back\nI send my shooters come in back-to-back\nThat's just because of my social status\nBitch mad that a nigga hit the trap all night\nAin't got the time to get the groceries baby\nThey pull up to the trap like vultures\nLongway consistent in motion\nWatching the pack just scatter like roaches\nThe spot on Beta(?), beat it down, got ghost\nI just want the money baby, I just want the money\nI just want the money baby, I just want the money\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCan't nothing beat the failure but a try\nWell I'm trying to get me some money\nBitch want to fucking lay up all night\nWell I'm trying to get me some money\nI can't wait to stay down 'til I get right\nWell I'm trying to get me some money\nSending packs state to state whatever flavor you like\nLong as you sending your money\n\n[Chorus]\nI just want the money baby, I just want the money\nI just want the money baby, I just want the money\nI just want the money baby, I just want the money\nI just want the money baby, I just want the money\n\n[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]\nI\u2019m trying to see the pyrex hit the pot\nHitting the baby to 125\nI hit the block like Omar on the wire\nA pump in my trench coat for the disguise\nI go for the gusto chasing the blue benjamins\nI might go longways road running with pies\nPull up like 2 man in the trunk for the buck\nI\u2019m just gone fuck that bitch ain\u2019t gone lay up\nI just want the money baby\nAnd no bitch we not going back and forth\nTurn the whole spot to the trap house resort\nPut 2-3 ounces in them baby pull ups\nWhen I answer my phone I\u2019m like pull up\nI got pounds of OG I can\u2019t wait to zip up\nLearned from the OG\u2019s go go get at them bucks\nMomma said don\u2019t you never give up\nI hit the street got the sleek and no fucks\nI just want to see my shoe boxes fill up (cash)\nI just want the money baby\nNo codefendant don\u2019t fuck with niggas that ain\u2019t handling business\nConvo bout money when we eat at Benni\u2019s\nDon\u2019t got no time to go back and forth with bitches\nI overnight it everytime I send it\nGet the pack and trap it out the trenches\n\n[Interlude: Dj Drama]\nYou know what I mean\nWhen I picked the name DJ Drama\nIts like a gift and a curse\nEven when I don't be looking for it or asking for it\nThe drama always comes and finds me\nI done had the fame\nI done had the ups I done had the downs\nSuccess is good, but after ten years strong nigga just cut me the check\nI got my feet kicked up, I just want the money\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCan't nothing beat the failure but a try\nWell I'm trying to get me some money\nBitch want to fucking lay up all night\nWell I'm trying to get me some money\nI can't wait to stay down 'til I get right\nWell I'm trying to get me some money\nSending packs state to state whatever flavor you like\nLong as you sending your money\n\n[Chorus]\nI just want the money baby, I just want the money\nI just want the money baby, I just want the money\nI just want the money baby, I just want the money\nI just want the money baby, I just want the money", "year": "2015-02-23"}]}
