{"artist": "Big Daddy Kane", "songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSee the crowd in an uproar actin' unstable\nHere comes Dark Gable raps remarkable\nThe mic ripper, cash flipper, Cristal sipper\nDerrie're batalliere, that's French for ass whipper\nLong time puttin' work in this, to be tremendous\nIf I'm not the best, then I'm a damn strikin' resemblance\nI roll the dice on the streets that be cold as ice\nAnd cause great disturbance just like a poltergeist\nI come attackin' this enrage to disengage the missin' page\nTo the newest in age that's hittin' stage\n(Why that be?)\nFor I be one that knows the art\nTo get you up and out your seat if you was Rosa Parks\nTell me, how much can you take from me, the man that make\nRhymes that be so butter, my breath smell like Land O'Lakes?\nYou know the lick, see me hit 'em like a brick\nPlus my posse run thick, not that click from Mario flick\nBeware of one of the best they be\nYou wanna test the God? I hope you mean the SAT\nBecause your poetasterous style, it plain, bore me\nPardon the vainglory, but here's the Kane story (come on!)\n\n[Chorus]\nBringin' you that uncut pure, knockin' at your door\nAbout to give you more of the raw\nPoint yo' hands up to the sky-\n\n[Verse 2]\nAh, man, fuck the chorus\nAnd let the lyrics sit up in the track like rigamortis\nI spit a few to listen to when this I do it's as if you\nWas invisible, it'll make your life miserable\nHip-hop icon, keep a grip just like a python\nI be that wrong one to get fly on\nBoy, you got to get that playa hatin' out you\nThat's the other side of the game and I ain't Erykah Badu\nBlack Caesar, don't you even reach my way\nYou soon to find a vital point that's on Priest Pai Mae\nI heat it up to where I pasteurize half the guys\nA fast demise, disaster lies as he dies\nConfront one of the best at rhymin'\nWhat I write it be so rough that my ink pen'd need alignment\nThe untouchable, don't want to tempt me\nI come kickin' through your door, unlawful entry\nIt be me, even though none of y'all want to see me\nFor real, damn, I know how Jehovah's Witness feel\nI remember how I formed it up\nBecause I took what was raw and then I warmed it up\nI turned the fire down to simmer as I calmed it up\nBut take a look, I think the Kane about to overcook\nCome and get it, but you better come with paramedics\n'Cause you couldn't bring it to me if you worked for Fed Ex\nI come cuttin' through, split his gut in two\nI touch 'em, what him do? You know the style ain't nothin' new\n(Let's go!)\n\n[Chorus x2]\nBringin' you that uncut pure, knockin' at your door\nAbout to give you more of the raw\nPoint yo' hands up to the sky, high\nGet on down, baby, we keep it live\n\n[Verse 3]\nA good game it lets the plot thicken\nBut the thing that just ain't clickin'\nIs the way y'all legalize trickin'\nYou talk about your ride when you don't even got one\nBut I can pull a hot one when inside of a Datsun\nThe wicked in the bed, plus the wicked in the head\nWhen I shoot the game, it's like my tongue got infra red\nLet the Messiah take you higher as I supply ya what you require\nDesire and admire it entire\nSudden impact as I'm guttin' 'em, black\nClosest thing to me would be (what's that?) nothin in fact\nI come with more in skill to always score and kill\nFemales adore and thrill, sweeter thing than Lauryn Hill\nAs I return with a vengeance, here comes the day of independence\nApproach 'em all with some bad intentions\nIn other words, I'm makin' 'em resign, diminish mine\nRunnin' through 'em like a finish line\n\n[Chorus x2]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/55a075f6632f5b5a223681bd3f7a7ca8.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "1998-04-28", "title": "Uncut, Pure (Original Version)", "album": "Veteranz Day"}]}
