{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse: Action Bronson]\nHit the clutch, shift to the gear\nMash on the gas. You're soon to see me\nRight by the lake just like a bass (kid)\nBurn these sticks like a native, gold potatoes, cold tornados\nHash is like a ball of Play-Do\nBut never play, though, tryin' to get that play dough\nTo have the whole team creamy like alfredo\nThe mozzarella, basil, oil, and tomato\nThe thirty year balsamic laid up on that table\nNext to me, a cigarette of drugs lay\nThere in my lungs that's while i'm driving, never drunk, wait\nIn the taxi shorty blessing me with tongue play\nDitch the cab, gonna twist it up the one-way\nShe lost a shoe, I bounced - dipped on her\nJust a victim of the cold world to get warmer\nThen I did with my spic friend in a quick Honda\nPick up a package from Juan down at the ship harbor\nSell it off in the crib, making the shit marble\nMar-vel taking chugs out of the big bottle\nDick sucks disappears thanks to a thick model\nHer ass is fat but the coconut is a bit hollow\nNo point in asking if the motherfucking bitch swallow\nAbsolut(e), like the shit that's in the clear bottle\nStraight from Sweden, see me counting money cheesin'\nDucks get shot out the sky, that's when it's huntin' season\nPhone rings fiendin' for stuff, Danny Tanner\nI handle business like a man, you're just a tranny dancer\nI'm going down, kid\nEast motherfucking bound and down, bronsolino\nBon appetite, bitch", "title": "East Bound and Down", "album": "Bon Appetit.....
