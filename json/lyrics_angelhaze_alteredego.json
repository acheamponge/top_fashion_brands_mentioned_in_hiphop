I don't ever wanna have to worry about making it here again, so I gotta be just like them.\"\n\nCreating subcategories;\nI don't fit within the persona that fits with them\nI've become you\nTrue in a sense, but, I lie all the more\nAnd confidence is the key that unlocks every door\nThat way you'd never know I felt this; You'd never know I feel it\nWith my Spider-Man senses I can hang upon the ceiling and hold my head in shame\nLook from whence I've came\n\nMy eyes are brightening the cave within the dark slow lives behind\nThere is emptiness where my fears reside\nI am a queen and a Pharaoh\nI am the villain and the hero\nI am death and I am life\nI am lows as well as highs\nI am truths within the lies\nI am a heroine and a zero\nI am too, altered ego\nWelcome", "year": null}]}
