Rap]\nNew York, New York, the city that never sleeps\nBodies, covered in white sheets, are layin in the streets\nShit gets deep, as we creep up the block by the kids slangin rocks\nAnd holdin Glocks stolen from the cops to get props\nYou gotta split a top, on the regular\nOr get plugged in your mug, from a slug, by your competitor\nGunshots echo throughout the city like thunder, no wonder\nAnother brother six feet under\nYou know it ain't no jokin when the streetlights are broken\nSo keep your eyes open, or get ready for a, smokin 'loc\nStep out of line, I hope you got your nine gun son\nThe Smith and Wess', you better press 9-1-1 (word up)\nOr make a run for it there's too many to tackle\nThe Big Apple'll put your ass on ice like a Snapple\nSo even though I rap I gots to stay strapped\nNiggas act up I back up (PI-YAH)\nI bust a cap inside your fuckin hat\nDon't even pose with them hoes, the swinger that you chose\nJust might be down with the foes, only the shadow knows\nAnd ain't no lollipop, lollipop over here only the shottie pops\n(BOOM) Now just sit back and watch the bodies drop\nThe younger gunmen got the bigger niggas runnin\nThe shorties (what) the shorties (what) the shorties are comin\nTo push a nigga wig back, and leave his ass flat on his back\nThe motherfuckin ghetto knows, and it's like that\n\n[Hook x3]\nYo, you gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go\n(And aiyyo, what you don't know, believe the ghetto knows)\n\n[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]\nToday's headlines, another nigga dead\nSix to the body and fo' to the head\nFollowed the red bitch in the bed full of lead\nA drug-related case and now the place is filled with Feds\nRamshacked the shack, disclouse 'bout two kilos of dope\nTwo ounces of coke's caught in the pocket of his coat\nSo, another brother caught the ultimate surprise\nWith blown out brains, to drop stains on his eyes\nDazed as I sit back and watch the channel two news\nWatchin his family goin through all the boo-hoos\nYou lose, like an Ill Street, the Blues are gettin deeper\nNothin left in the room except for him, the Grim Reaper\nPolice will take a few snapshots, scoop up some blooddrops\nPull out a file on a juvenile child of mugshots\nThe cops knew he fell victim to laws on the street\nSo they just, pull out the white sheets, to cover up the dead meat\nSeal off the area with yellow tape, draw the white\nChalk around the body now the party has to motivate\nOne more outlaw, was murdered on the scene for the green\nDied at the age of seventeen\n\n[Hook x3]\nYo, you gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go\n(And aiyyo, what you don't know, believe the ghetto knows)\n\n[Verse 3: Kool G. Rap]\nStrollin the concrete, packin my heat, walkin the backstreets\nI seen niggas pull up, peepin me out the side a black Jeep\nSix feet deep, that's where I'm goin if I'm slippin\nSteady cockin my shit cause I already got the clip in\nNow who's the first nigga to run up, here they come up\nThe block hardrocks with Glocks rollin holdin they guns up\nI buck, I buck, and then I struck one in the chest\nNigga shoulda wore a vest but now his ass is put to rest\nBut now I got three mo' niggas, pullin triggers\nStrays are ricochetin off the bricks, zigga zigga\nBut who got the biggest strap? Who's bustin bigger caps?\nMy BOOM BOOM BOOMS against they PAP PAP PAPS\nNo haps, G. Rap ain't goin out like a sucker\nI reloaded the shot and dropped another motherfucker\nQuick, I duck and shit to dodge the bullets comin at me\nCause I won't be too happy with a slug inside my nappy\nTwo more niggas left, they scared to death, but I'm leary\nShit gets kinda scary when I got bulletholes near me\nI went between two cars, lettin off the quarter pound\nI see another body fallin down to the ground\nQuick I run up on him cause I don't think that he's dead\nStandin over his ass I put two more inside his head\nThat's three niggas down, only got one nigga to go\nI gots to send his ass to the gravedigger so\nI lay low in the cut and wait for moneygrip to slip up\nNearly shot my whole clip up, I got one more slug to rip up\nLook over by the GS, see his ass stickin his head out\nBoom, let the lead out, blew a piece of his brain dead out\nThe back of his head, now he's dead, because he fell face down\nRight on the motherfuckin streets that he dwelled\n\n[Hook x2]\nYo, you gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go\n(And aiyyo, what you don't know, believe the ghetto knows)"}]}
