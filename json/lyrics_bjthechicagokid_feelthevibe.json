I know that you ain't forget about your folk\nLate again, he may not come when you want\nBut I'm always up, on time\nSo roll up the smoke, la-la (La-la)\nThe weed's too potent so I had to call mama\nTell her how much I love her for cookin' them home products\nWhen them bills would pile up, cereal with the water\nIf Lord couldn't help us, we had Hamburger Helper\nWhen you want it done right, you gotta get it for yourself, uh\nIt don't seem right bein' older than my uncle\nSome people call it ghetto, I prefer another level\nBut I'm 'bout to board this plane, I can't wait to see your face and hear you say\n\n[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]\nCome on in, close the door and feel the vibe\nWe got macaroni and cheese, collard greens and chicken inside\nCan't forget the corn bread\nTalkin' shit with the old heads\nMama dancin' to some Al Green\nMy Auntie join her and my Daddy said, \"Go 'head\"\nWhile he shine up his pinky ring\nDon't forget to close the screen\nCome on in, close the door and feel the vibe\nWe got macaroni and cheese, collard greens and chicken inside\nCan't forget the corn bread\nTalkin' shit with the old heads\nMama dancin' to some Al Green\nMy Auntie join her and my Daddy said, \"Go 'head\"\n'Bout to roll up the sticky green\n'Bout to sneak and roll up\n\n[Interlude: BJ the Chicago Kid]\nRoll up\nRoll up\nRoll up\nRoll up\nRoll up\nRoll up\nRoll up\nRoll up\n\n[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]\nCome on in, close the door and feel the vibe\nWe got macaroni and cheese, collard greens and chicken inside\nCan't forget the corn bread\nTalkin' shit with the old heads\nMama dancin' to some Al Green\nMy Auntie join her and my Daddy said, \"Go 'head\"\nWhile he shine up his pinky ring\nDon't forget to close the screen\nCome on in, close the door and feel the vibe\n\n[Outro: BJ the Chicago Kid]\nRoll up\nRoll up\nRoll up\nRoll up\nRoll up\nRoll up\nRoll up\nRoll up\nDon't forget to close the screen\nRoll up"}], "artist": "BJ the Chicago Kid"}
