Well you better abort. it don't go well for you\nThat's hell for you, I'm telling you all\nI don't want to see you perish\nBut you wanna ball so hard like them Ninjas In Paris, kawasaki\nThey wanna put me in a box like Rocky\n'Cause I talk about God, but not me Papi\nLet me keep it honest like I had too much sake\nSome people say I'm cocky, I just know that God got me\n\n[Chorus]\nSome say I'm cocky, I just know that God got me\nSome say I'm cocky, I just know that God got me\nSome say I'm cocky, I just know that God got me\nI just know that God got me\nI just know that God got me\nGot me, got me\nI just know that God got me\nGot me, got me\nI just know that God got me\nGot me, got me\nI just know that God got me\nGot me, got me\nI just know that God got me\n\n[Verse 2]\nFeasting on God's word, chop it up properly\nWatch me put it down raw like hibachi\nUptown New York City where you can spot me\nSomebody told me I'm the only thing that can stop me\nNever will I grow beyond a servant\nSnakeskin on a strapback but I'm free from the serpent\nEverybody worship even if you're not churchin'\nWhat your living for is God, power, pleasure or your job\nSome livin' for they clothes, call it True Religion\nY'all ain't tryna hear me like them demos I be getting\nI think they get the memo, the Christians in the building\nAnd they been getting higher than the Keisha that you're twisting\nY'all know how to get it, encounters with the Most High\nYou don't need to blow loud, come and get to know Jah\nI'll introduce you to Supplier\n'Cause He don't want your deeds, boy, He wants your desires\nIt's hard to spit fire when you hardly get inspired\nBy the genre you're inside of, everybody wanna try to\nBe something they not, well guess what, do you\nI'm still covered in that blood like SuWoo\n\n[Chorus]\nSome say I'm cocky, I just know that God got me\nSome say I'm cocky, I just know that God got me\nSome say I'm cocky, I just know that God got me\nI just know that God got me\nI just know that God got me\nGot me, got me\nI just know that God got me\nGot me, got me\nI just know that God got me\nGot me, got me\nI just know that God got me\nSome say I'm cocky\nI just know that God got me\n\n[Spoken]\nMaybe it's just the New York in me\nI don't know\nSome say I'm cocky I just know that God got me\nUptown\nWash Heights, what up\n\n[Chorus]\nSome say I'm cocky, I just know that God got me\nSome say I'm cocky, I just know that God got me\nSome say I'm cocky, I just know that God got me\nI just know that God got me\nI just know that God got me"}]}
