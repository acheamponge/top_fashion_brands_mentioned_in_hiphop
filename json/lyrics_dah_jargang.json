I couldn't chase it\nHave to make it\nFuck I look like stressing writing papers, needing cake\nAnd knowing that my fucking talent being wasted, nah\nNot me, shout out Nasty Nell\nThese women and my vices made that cash appeal\nBecause I'm slipping for the paper, nigga that's for real\nBlunt facing everyday, just tryna catch a thrill\nThese hoes tell me what I'm spitting, nigga kinda far out\nRan out of weed, told my brother break the jar out\n\nYeah, told my brother break the jar out\nGot no Ls, told that nigga bring the car out\nTell me what I'm spitting is far out\nRan outta weed tell that nigga break the jar out\nYeah\nYeah\nYeah\nYeah\nDid somebody just come up here?", "album": "Caveman Files", "year": "2011-03-15", "title": "Jar Gang", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8364eac38f8e9f936d9169b02883e6b0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Da$H"}
