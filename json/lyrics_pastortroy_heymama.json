Glock first I cock then I hit 'em\nThey got me down here Right Street 7th floor\nAin't nothin I can change I just go with the flow\nI'm feelin kinda low, but I guess I'll be straight\nJust hit the lawyer up and try to rush the court date\n\n[Chorus] - 2x\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, verse 3, verse 3\nHey mama, they shipped me off to prison\nA home cooked meal only thang that I'm missin\nSo holler at my girl, so holler at my son\nAnd tell 'em that I'm sorry for the wrong that he done\nMaybe this could've been avoided but I'd doubt it\nAll I can do is write another rap about it\nAnd try to stay 'sane, it's all in the game\nWhen some here for killing, when some here for 'caine\nWhen some here for chilling wrong place wrong time\nWhen some here situation just like mine\nBut I have no regrets, it could've been worse\nI could've been dead if I didn't bust first\nSo mama, I hope that I'm forgiven\nI write you everyday while I'm chillin off in prison\nI'm tryin to get religion, I'm tryin to do better\nWith all my love, til' I write your next letter, your son\n\n[Chorus] - 4x", "year": null}]}
