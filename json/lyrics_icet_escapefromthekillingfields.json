We're black! We're supposed to be poor!\"\n\nShut up! Do you know how dumb you sound?\nThat mentality's  what keeps my people down!\nNo one wants to live in an urban war\nYou live there cause your parents were poor\nThey live there because theirs were also\nGet yourself together, hit the gates bro!\n\nCHORUS\nYa gotta get out! Ya gotta get out! Why?\nYa gotta get out! Ya gotta get out! Why?\nYa gotta get out! Ya gotta get out! Why?\n\u2018Cause the fields are where you die!\nI escaped from the killing fields!\nI escaped from the killing fields!\n\nYou try to keep us running and running faster\nBut I ain't runnin' from ya; I'm runnin' at ya!\nAnd my posse's thick, about a mil strong\nToo late to make up now, cause it's on\nI'm the one that's got ya in constant fear\nI'm the nigga ya shoulda killed last year\nBut you played yourself: you let me gain wealth\nNow I can change the way the cards are dealt!\nI've schooled my homeboys, made 'em all understand\nThe tricks and twists inflicted on the Black man\nHow ya make me think to be down\nI gotta stay around\nDown in the motherfuckin' battleground\n\n\"We got the Puerto Ricans where we want 'em, we got the Mexicans and the Blacks where we want 'em... Well, shit, they're all Black! We gotta keep 'em together, the same way we got those fuckin' Indians!\"\n\nThere'll never be any good schools in the hood\nThere'll never be any cops that are any good!\nThe hospital is a great place to go to die\nReal estate's cheap, let me tell ya why\nThe man's got a sure fire system:\nA economic prison!\n\nCHORUS\n\nI escaped from the killing fields!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8ba43671bb57813daf61c8431aebd0ea.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "O.G.
