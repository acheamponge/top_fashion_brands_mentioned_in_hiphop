The Rugged Man]\nCheck this, I wreck shit, I rip shit, no\nBring that shit back, rewind it (ihateeverybodyihateverybodyihateeverybody..)\nYou can't kick it what I'm talking bout\nBLAOW! Shout it out\nNow your faggot ass is walking out\n1 to head from the white bred and ya dead bled\nDripping bleak blood red, from the bloodshed\nWestern bitches with my big testes I molest them\nShitty rappers I dissect 'em, swallow 'em and the digest 'em\nIiii don't give a motherfuck about you\nThe whack rap I can't live without you\nI don't need it if I meet a stank pussy\nI meet greet it, I might eat it I ain't never been defeated\nNobody knows\nThat I got the ill flows, shit blows when my dick grows\nI'm doing tours I'm down with whores not jabber jaws\n(I got a man) Oh yeah word, shut the fuck up and drop your drawers!\nBloodshed hua, say goodbye to oo-eh, ooh eh\nStraight ooh eh\n\n[Hook: R.A. The Rugged Man]\nBloodshed hua hoo, hua hoo!\nBloodshed hua hoo, hua hoo!\nBloodshed hua hoo, hua hoo!\nBloodshed hua hoo, hua hoo!\nBloodshed hua hoo, hua hoo!\nBloodshed hua hoo, hua hoo!\nBloodshed hua hoo, hua hoo!\nBloodshed hua hoo, hua hoo!\n\n[Verse 2: R.A. The Rugged Man]\nBeastie neck fool down in Carolina\nI won't going \"downtown\"\nUnless there's gold in her vagina\nThey have opinions, the southern counties\nAct like [?] I take out three of them, I hate to be 'em\nWith the hua-haa, bloodshed hua hoo\nWit da new-eh, style for your crew-eh\nAnd I could just make it get to ya baby, blauuhh\n(Yo kick that real shit!) Now what was it?\nGot disgusted, now bust it, ya microphone is rusted\nI buh-buh-buh-ba-bum rushed it\nIt's ALRIGHT, I'll make ya feel it\nHopsy topsy, I'm lethal like a nazi you can't stop me\nWho da fuck ya think ya are?\nBla bla bla (R.A. The Rugged) a superstar!\nI don't need no nonsense, the constantly be jumping\nFrom my John-son (YES!) I be there where ya at punk\nYa better watch ya back cos I never fight fair\nSo bring some hookers and I might have some do rahh\nBloodshed hua haaa!\n\n[Hook: R.A. The Rugged Man]\nBloodshed hua hoo, hua hoo!\nBloodshed hua hoo, hua hoo!\nBloodshed hua hoo, hua hoo!\nBloodshed hua hoo, hua hoo!\nBloodshed hua hoo, hua hoo!\nBloodshed hua hoo, hua hoo!\nBloodshed hua hoo, hua hoo!\nBloodshed hua hoo, hua hoo!\n\n[Verse 3: R.A.
