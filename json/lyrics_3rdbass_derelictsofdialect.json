It's Serch and I crush this\nMental need for oppression\nOppressed and all vexed and just placed a suggestion\nLesson or loss enforce those in\nA spot who got your head frozen\nDefrost the eye and spy on the serpent\nOn act two, he tried to close curtain\nBut intermission I glimpsed and I clock more\nDerelicts watch act three and the encore\n\n[Chorus: Samples]\n\"Menace to the neighborhood\"\n\"Menace to the neighborhood\"\n\n[Outro: Sample]\n\"Individuals who are never satisfied with the static standards set by the masses\u2014the masses have always been lethargic. They have always opposed greatness, for it is beyond them to even\u2014comprehend greatness.\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ba67f25eba0c6951171aa44e82a3051a.600x600x1.jpg", "album": "Derelicts of Dialect", "title": "Derelicts of Dialect", "year": "1991-06-18"}]}
