'cause I really lived it\nIt's a never-ending battle, squares think that I'm wack\nEven though I'm twenty years strong with platinum and gold plaques\nKeep listening to your bubblegum raps, you punk biatch (What you gon' do?)\nI'ma kick back, count stacks and get rich\nI bust moves (BIATCH!)\n\n[Chorus: E-40]\nI bust moves\nI bust moves, OOOUH\nI bust moves\nLook, man, I stay bustin' moves\n\n[Verse 2: Droop-E]\nI go hard for my bread like toast, nigga\nSee through you fake fucks like a ghost, nigga\nThey say this liquor is the truth serum\nI'm faded so I'm saying how I feel\nI'm 'bout to make a few mill, every bitch on my heels\nFlow sound shallow but you know that it's the real\nMan, I bust moves\nCleaner than chlorine, got every bitch wetter than a pool\nYou already know\nDroop-E too cool, you already go\nI'm 'bout to be living high in the sky\nPenthouse higher than Rihanna hairline\n\n[Chorus: E-40]\nI bust moves\nI bust moves\nI bust moves, OOOUH\nI bust moves\nLook, man, I stay bustin' moves\n\n[Verse 3: Big Omeezy]\nWe bustin' moves dynamic, Dolby digital sound\nYou can hear us out your speaker box for miles and miles\nState to state, ready to increase my plate\nShow them niggas that be quitting that it ain't too late\nWatch me choose my fate, you see I'm in it to win it\nLike my father, he said, \"Get up, get out, and go get it\"\nIt's the way that I live, bust with a jab and a weave\nStay ahead of them suckas, stay havin' tricks up my sleeve\nI'm on the mound, I'm on deck, forever shoutin' my set\nThe biggest, realest, chillest, illest, I don't know about that\nBut if it's about getting my issue, shit, then show me the way\nBust a move, make it happen, put me in motion and play\nI get emotional, mayne, I came from nothing at all\nNow it's all about living, loving, straight having a ball\nSome nickels actin' back then, but now we having a feast\nAnd ask my partner AJ, he this mobbin' ass beat\n\n[Chorus: E-40]\nI bust moves\nI bust moves\nI bust moves, OOOUH\nI bust moves\nLook, man, I stay bustin' moves"}]}
