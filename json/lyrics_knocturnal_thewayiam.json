You know the night's just begun\nThe after hours spot is off the hook\nThe ugly crows buy the bottle of Crook\nThe fly crows keep smokin the kush\nSo you know I got a bird and a bush\nYou run up, you get stomped to mush\nLook it here, I talk to God, I don't pray\nWhen I want somethin, I don't play\nIt's Knoc-turn'al with a capital K\nBest believe it's a brand new day\nAnd if you feel me sunshine, come around my way\n\n[Chorus - Knoc-turn'al]\nPut your hands up, come off them grams\nI ain't trippin that's the way I am (the way I am)\nAnd if you see me with heat in my hand\nYou better duck that's the way I am (the way I am)\nI can't believe ya got up in them pants\nSexy lady gon' do that dance (*breathing noises*)\nCome on over when your sick of ya man\nAnd we can chill that's the way I am (the way I am)\n\n[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]\nLight blue shoes (shoes), dark blue pants (uh)\nFour, five bitches and they all wanna dance\nI don't get down bitch, that ain't my program\nI don't hold hands and I don't slow jam (uh uh)\nI C-Walk in the park with the fellas\nAnd make suckers jealous cause they can't out sell us\nYou wanna join us?
