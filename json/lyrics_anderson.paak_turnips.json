Don't know\nJust know my cuff low\nSo fill it up until I meet the brim\nSo I could sip it up until I meet my grim\nThen then, yeah\nRelease the matches\nLocked up in my pockets\nDrag it against my jeans  and drop it\nLet's see what happens\n\n[Hook]\nHey, I got them turnips for the turn up\nWhat a wonderful feeling\nI bought the five for the burning\nBut it rolled the building\nNow watch it burn down\nWatch it burn down\n\nGot them turnips for the turn up\nWhat a wonderful feeling\nI bought the five for the burning\nBut it rolled the building\nNow watch it burn down\nWatch it burn down\nBurn down, burn down\nBurn down, burn down"}]}
