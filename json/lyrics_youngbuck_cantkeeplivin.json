R.I.P. I got boys like that\nWho said they needed a white pack to strike back, shit\nJust give me the right mac and nigga I'll be right back\nHardcore, and show these niggas they don't want war\nYou want more? Well gimme what I'm here for\nY'all know I been raw, from day one\nThis teenager with the big boys, gettin the job done\nGot a daddy, but he ignored both of his sons\nHad to pay for my own way, as a child on the run\nI ain't scary, the AK-47, I married\nCause a nigga had to have that by any means necessary\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Young Buck]\nLook what y'all done to me, forced a nigga to this point\nWouldn't feed me when I was hongry, I couldn't ignore it\nBut I stay to my - lonely, and didn't show it\nSo when I killed you and your homies, you wouldn't know it\nCristal I let you po' it while I fuck with the Hennessy\nAll this time I'm the nigga that you pretend to be\nTables done turned now I'm like \"Remember me?\nThe same lil' nigga you overcharged for a ki\"\nTimes hard on a G, you was larger than me\nYoung, but I ain't dumb, you ain't smarter than me\nGive niggas a inch, and they takin the whole mile\nSo I hop out the 6, and I takin they whole pile\nUh-uh whoa now, how many niggas see this grown child\nShit gettin hectic then you shut 'em down\nTennessee to Uptown, niggas is thuggin, mean muggin\nAin't no stoppin I'm hot, and the game is what I'm lovin nigga\n\n[Hook] - 2X w/ ad libs\n\nGet money nigga!", "album": "T.I.P.", "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/d018174ecb7b887477659509ddf44ca3.499x499x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young Buck"}
