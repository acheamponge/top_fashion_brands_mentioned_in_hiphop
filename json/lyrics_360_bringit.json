The youth is\nCall us pathetic, I'll tell you what pathetic is\nThis whole scene's topic range is always something negative\nYo, the girls like us, we dress with impressive taste (what?)\nThey hate you, you dress to impress your mates (true)\nI went for it when I looked at the risk\nI got balls, jumped up and dissed the Hoods at a gig\nNow a bunch of dudes, when they see me, really want to break my jaw\nBut the hood status is exactly what I\u2019m aiming for\nAnd now these tough emcees want to see me fuckin' bleed\nIt wasn't a threat, that line was only tongue in cheek (fuck)\nThis scene is hard to find the energy for\nThis is heart on the sleeve rap, leave the rest at the door\nAnd I lost a fan base just like never before\nI've been shunned 'cause I ain\u2019t workin' with Trem anymore\nI was stoked to be down with the Lyrical Commission\nThat style wasn\u2019t me though, I was innocently driven\nAnd watch you run and say that '60 went and dissed them\nThat ain\u2019t a diss, you dumb-arse, it's a difference of opinion\nIt takes a man to admit it, yo, it wasn't me\nI love that raw style but honestly, it's not for me\nIt ain\u2019t me, yeah, you can\u2019t hate me\n'Cause I love Lord Finesse but I'd rather listen to Jay-Z\nSo if someone hates me, they react physically\nI wonder why? They can\u2019t fuck with me lyrically\nAnd you can hate me 'cause I\u2019m singin' on tracks\nBut if you got a problem, then come and bring it on wax\n\n[Outro]\nI'll burn you, yeah\nThat was to anyone, I\u2019m fuckin' over it\nSomeone"}]}
