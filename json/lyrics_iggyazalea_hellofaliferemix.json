Still a backseat driver\nEvery time we get close you can't make your mind up\nWanna move away, run fast from that fake stuff\nBottle full of poison make the right angle to-to up\nSleeping on your nanny couch, city of angels\nThey got devils in dresses\nSo pretty make you question\nSatan that you kissin'? fuck it\nNow trippin'\nGet a call for the weekend\nGet a room at the Days Inn\nLet the days blur together\nBet that lime wash away quick\nBirds of a Feather\nRocking furs in the winter\nShe gon' fly now\nBut summer leaves your ass for the next thing\nGave your last dollar to a heart that loves attention\nHadda read that better woulda seen it in the fine print\nGotta take a loss\nKiss your mama with them lips\nMake amends with his right hand\nAsk him to forgive\nIt's about truth and freedom\nGood word, meaning\nLove ignorant shit but feel a [?] could reedem him\nYeah you in-between it\nDevil and the deep blue\n[?]\u00a0in the news so\nStick to what you used to\n[?] sell a single\n[?] sequel\nBaby, piss into the wind probably still break equal\nYou probably [?] is what my best friend Shawna says\nMy manager and all the big record label heads\nSaid to make songs for they who can't write sentences\nSaid to keep it dumb because they just can't make sense of this\nMisery don't love company, it loves ignorance\nSo get your mind gone, keep your mind blown\nWe don't need no knowledge, you just want another rap song\nGet your mind gone, keep your mind blown\nYou don't want no knowledge, you just want another rap song\nYou just want another rap song\nYou just want another rap song", "image": "https://images.genius.com/76f39b66b2b431165a5f0061f648d4b2.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": null, "year": "2011-01-01"}]}
