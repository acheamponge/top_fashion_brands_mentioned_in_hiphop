Let your chest relax. Your neck, your shoulders. Feel your entire soul relaxing\nYou can feel yourself relaxing now. You can feel a heavy relaxed feeling coming over you and as I continue to talk, that heavy relaxed feeling will get stronger untill it carries you into a deep peaceful state of hypnosis\n\nYou're sinking down now. Sinking down and shutting down. Sinking down and shutting down\nShutting down completely\n\nNow you're resting comfortably in deep and a peaceful state of sleep. Going deeper and faster. All of the time\nUntill I bring you back only accept those suggestions which are for you benefit. And that you are willing to accept\n\nYou are completely under state of hypnosis\nGood luck", "title": "Intro (Dr. Chosis)", "year": null, "album": "The War Within", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e384fbb42e445fb209514af1582b2973.440x440x1.jpg"}]}
