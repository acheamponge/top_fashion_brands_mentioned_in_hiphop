This is life beneath the monolith\nWhere I can seek a guide to see that I can reach the bottom with\nThe clocks will switch when the idle pieces ball to fists\nCuz all of this is just a wish that I could meet the dawn again (x3)\n\n(At night I close my eyes)\nAnd I pray for the sunset, wishing you were here so the day wasn't done yet\n(At night I close my eyes)\nWhen the light glares in, I'll just dream about you 'til the nightmares end\n(At night I close my eyes)\nAnd I pray for the sunset, wishing you were here so the day wasn't done yet\n(At night I close my eyes)\nWhen the light glares in, I'll just dream about you 'til the nightmares end\n\n[Louise Fraser]\nI never meant to release you, I never made out alive\nI never meant just to tease you, I never meant you to cry\nI never meant you to cry, I never meant you to cry\nAt night I close my eyes, to be with you\nAt night I close my eyes, just to see you again\nAt night I close my eyes, to be with you\nAt night I close my eyes, just to see you again\nI'm in a rift without you, the sky is still blue\nAt night I close my eyes\nI'm in a rift without you, the sky is still blue\nAt night I close my eyes...", "album": "The Balancing Act"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
