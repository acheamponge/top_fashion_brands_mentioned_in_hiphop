sayin'\nThe plight of a rapper or whatever\nOr the trials of tribulations\nCause you know, aside from me strugglin' or coming up in one of the most\nFucked up, hating ass areas in the world\nI played football for twelve years you know\nAnd anybody who plays sports, you know you got politics\nAnd you got all the other bullshit\nSo I'mma talk about a little bit of that\nAnd I'mma stop rappin' and start rappin' now\nSo drop the slam and let's get sick\n\n[Verse 1: Wale]\nHalfback toss to right\nYeah the coach used to say I was awesome, right\nO.D. was in the weight room all his life\nBut I was more self concerned with the broads in life\nOn to college, Im always on the yard like farmers\nNever in class\nDorm room hoppin' if workouts optional\nIm not rockin'\nI can run an option best in my conference\nLook at my accomplishments, I'm all county\nYou double A niggas should be lucky y'all signed me\nLucky y'all found me, lucky y'all stole me\nI could be with Bowden, I could be with Friedgen\nTwo a day curfews, where's my Freedom?\nSchool ain't even start yet, there ain't not freaks here\nMight as well prepare\nSeason opener, finna be there\nWhen the depth chart came, there was no me there\nI mean me is there, but it's like three there\nWhich made me have to wait like leap year\nCause I ain't really lift weights, I didn't need them\nI run a 4.4, so they won't catch me there\nKnocking on my coach door like a missionary\nPlaybook like a Oxford dictionary\nAttitude that was not really felling\nAnd he put me on ice, I was Oksana literally\nI keep talking, I keep talking\nMy scholarship won't straight like Rodman\nSo Im walking\nFuck it, Im leaving\nVSU next season\nPeace\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nI need you right now\nI need you right now\nYou know how long I've been on ya\nSince Prince was on Apollonia\nSince O.J. had Isotoners\nDon't act like I never told ya\n\n[Verse 2: Wale]\nThey say, Trojans never break but it ain't that\nFor God sake, you can call coach Faison\nI've seen dreams turn dust, cause he made them\nCause he played them, when he ain't played them\nI've seen niggas loose cool, niggas leave school\nAnd back to the block with nothing better to do\nVSU don't regret you\nJust regret the fact that I left too soon\nI got kicked off, I used to shit talk\nExcuse my complaint, but I got to get it off\nHey Mr. coach, I don't like you\nYou don't me, that don't mean I gotta move\nYou see the way I move, I am in another gear\nYou can ask Los, I was like a young Gale\nMy coach ain't care, so I ain't care\nHe ain't even respect the name, he said Whale\nSo I said yeah, and he was like yeah\nYou fumbled in a drill, young man get on the hill\nSo Im like fuck it, Im out get on your head\nSuch Karma, next year they 4-6\nA few niggas stay, a lot of niggas quit\nAnd now I only listen to this hip-hop shit\nA few niggas stay, a lot of niggas quit\nMan fuck this shit\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nI need you right now\nI need you right now\nYou know how long I've been on ya\nSince Prince was on Apollonia\nSince O.J. had Isotoners\nDon't act like I never told ya\n\n[Verse 3: Wale]\nI go, in when I start putting words out\nWords sharp like a Jerry Rice curl route\nIm moonshine, y'all merlot\nI got on, and I gotta thank Marlon\nThank Kenny Burns, though we not talking\nBut my squad like the 72' Dolphins\nClimate Shula, my flow Csonka\nIm so Bonkas, Im not conscious\nThey are not confident when Im talking\nMake them more insecure when they caught one\nHe tried tossing to Andre Johnson\nNow Im getting compliments on how charming I am\nAnd Im way out London, way out conscious\nY'all never seen\nExclusives, y'all never seen\nThey wait on my return, I am Vai Sikahema\nWrite it in my leisure, I rather go shopping\nGucci & Nike, that\u2019s what I call an option\nUm Tom Frazier, new LeBron haters\nGot you niggas all over my bars just like Frasier\nI've become immune to you no name haters\nThey can not pause like Ryu on Sega\nI get inspired about your make up\nYou no good like a stripper with a \"A\" cup\nYoung Arrington, coming for you Aikman\nAye Jay, 8 grand skins gonna take that\nAye Bo, 10 stacks on the Patriots\nAye Rich, another 5 on the G Men\nAnother 5, Eli won't even be there\nNo Strahan, y'all need to rebuild\nBack to you homo spittin so, so\nYou can't kick it like Romo hold for ya\nNo more for the broke I am more so\nA first rounder, y'all don't want a Russell\nI must go like fly route\nMy tires align with the play, but the times out\nYeah hail Mary full of grace\nI swear these off rhyme bums are full of hate\nYoung Peyton don't huddle, still run my play\nStill run that break, still get my ring, still run my shit\nAnd it ain't no thing, you in Dungy's dungeon\nSo get that straight, yeah get that straight\nAin't nothing to Peyton\nI am Marvin with mind, but I listen to Wayne\nAnd I listen to 'Ye\nStill listen to Big\nAnd I listen to Jay\nThey are the coaches in this\nAnd I listen to thought\nAnd I listen to Common\nWe have nothing in Common\nThe shit that I spit is more", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/e0cde0eabe61c1ddca97cce2386792d2.421x421x1.jpg"}]}
