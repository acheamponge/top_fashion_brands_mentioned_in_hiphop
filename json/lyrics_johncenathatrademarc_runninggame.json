You know there's ten chicks aboard\nPlus the whip got more switches than the mixer board\nI'm stickin your whore, while you flossin your Range\nGave her a dollar, she gave me back a buck and some change\nShe tried to swallow me whole, I brushed the back of her wig\nShe called my dick Frank White cause it's Notoriously B.I.G\n\n[Hook 2x: John Cena]\nWe roll by in the pimp ride (then we)\nWalk through with the pimp slide (y'all know me)\nCrew heavy on the thick side\nEverybody feelin this, y'all know we serious"}], "artist": "John Cena & Tha Trademarc"}
