All my folks (How they die?) Quickly\nNever really lived they life but they died particularly\nAnyone who kept it real, Chuck and so many others\nPreying for my pockets must've guess we dodge them undercovers\n(So you sell drugs?) No, I show love, don't nobody love me\nPapa wasn't there for me, momma never hugged me\nBugging me bout what I do, loan me a G or two\nJust like I fuckin thought all you do is fuckin talk\n\n[Chorus - 4x]\nI do what I wanna do, I do what I have to do\nAnd if that mean blast at you, my nigga we blast at you\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen the pressure becomes too much upon my heart\nWhere the fuck I'm 'posed to go?\nFlex like these other folks, fuck that shit twist my smoke\nI'm told \"no\" so much that \"yes\" will probably scare me\nSo I dont give a fuck no more, whatever I am ready\nGod already prepared me for Hell so hell I'm straight\nGive me a house and crush up the ounce, nothing but weight\nAnd I won't be the only pastor that'll be burning\nNo mistakes yeah you heard it, cuz it wasn't misworded\nBecause ain't nobody perfect, who knows if God forgave you\nJust because you got fucked up you asking him to save you\nBehave you, or I'll be forced to grab my rifle\nAnd anything I do will be done for my survival\n\n[Chorus - 6x]", "year": null}]}
