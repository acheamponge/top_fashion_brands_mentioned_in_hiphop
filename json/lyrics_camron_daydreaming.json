Turn around, ask you to cook me (crack)\nBoost my work with a jerk and tell the truth it hurts\nCause you even ask me to come through to church\nWhat I do? Act second rate\nI stole ten dollars out of the collection plate\nBut I'm ready to change\nYou got my heart, plus you smart\nAnd the sex is great\nAnd you hate rap, I like that girl\nI argue with Keisha, I ain't like that girl\nYou jumped right out the car, to fight that girl\nYou beat her (ass), you ain't have to bite that girl\nAnd my baby got the best thighs\nAnd my whip she ain't never got to test drive\nCopped her the X5\nYou paid attention when no one acknowledge me\nThis is my public apology, holla B\n\n[Chorus: Tiffany & Cam'ron]\nHey baby let's get away let's go somewhere ah\nBaby, can weeee\nWe can get the drop top or come through on the bike\nWe could go where you want we could do what you like tonight\nHey baby let's get away let's go somewhere ah\nBaby, can weeee\nWhere you wanna go?\nWhere Italy? What Sicily? Tell me girl, Disney World? Huh?\n\n[Verse 2: Tiffany]\nHe's the kind of guy that would say \"hey baby, let's get away\"\nLet's go some place oh\nWhere I don't, care\nHe's the kind of guy that will give it everything and trust your heart\nShare all of your love, 'til death do you part\nI wanna be what he wants, when he wants it\nWhenever he needs it\nWhen he lonesome and feeling love starved I'll be there to feed it\nLoving him a little bit more each day\nFears are at hold when I hear him saaaaayyyy...\n\n[Chorus: Tiffany & Cam'ron]\nHey baby let's get away let's go somewhere ah\nBaby, can weeee\nWe can get the drop top or come through on the bike\nWe could go where you want we could do what you like tonight\nHey baby let's get away let's go somewhere ah\nBaby, can weeee\nWhere you wanna go?\nWhere Italy? What Sicily? Tell me girl, Disney World? Huh?\n\n[Verse 3: Cam'ron]\nYou helped me work when we was twelve and a half\nYou said Cam, \"what the (fuck) dog, we twelve and a half\"\nThat house cost millions, twelve and a half\nBut I still got them (?), twelve in the stash\nYou can't even get mad\nSay what the hell just laugh\nStanding there beautiful like what I'm gon' do with you\nYou wanted me to go to school and just play ball\nWhat I do? Go to school with that 8-ball\nHere come the (?), here come the (?)\nYeah I dealt that, I'm a hustla though\nI can't help that\nYou was there when I flipped my first birds\nNow we gon' see my son take his first words\nAnd um, absurd, I ain't wanna be no singer ma\nI just wanted eight karats on your finger ma\nSince were young, you thug me I thugged you\nYou hug me, I hugged you\nYou love me, I love you\n\n[Chorus: Tiffany & Cam'ron]\nHey baby let's get away let's go somewhere ah\nBaby, can weeee\nWe can get the drop top or come through on the bike\nWe could go where you want we could do what you like tonight\nHey baby let's get away let's go somewhere ah\nBaby, can weeee\nWhere you wanna go?\nWhere Italy? What Sicily? Tell me girl, Disney World? Huh?\n\n[Bridge: Tiffany]\nI wanna be what he wants, when he wants it\nWhenever he needs it\nWhen he lonesome and feeling love starved I'll be there to feed him\nLoving him a little bit more each day\nFears are at hold when I hear him saaaaayyyyy...\n\n[Chorus: Tiffany & Cam'ron]\nHey baby let's get away let's go somewhere ah\nBaby, can weeee\nWe can get the drop top or come through on the bike\nWe could go where you want we could do what you like tonight\nHey baby let's get away let's go somewhere ah\nBaby, can weeee\nWhere you wanna go?\nWhere Italy?
