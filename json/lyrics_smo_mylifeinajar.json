Joes and grape snow cones\nBaseball cards and ceiling stars that glow\nSo I got an old jar from a masons box\nI wrote my name on the front and poked a slot in the top\nAnd dropped in that first penny watched it rattle around\nAnd everywhere that I went I kept my eyes to the ground\nFor a nickel dime dollar working for my papa\nFarm chores paid more as it got hotter\nEither bush hoggin\u2019 the field or haulin\u2019 some hay\nI would weed the whole garden for a full day\u2019s pay\nAnd my daddy taught me that if you earned your way\nIt will mean more to you when you spend it some day\nKeep saving up your change\nNever throw it away\nFill your jar to the top and put it somewhere safe\nWelcome to\n\n[Chorus: CB3]\nMy life in a jar\nIt sure has takin\u2019 me so far\nFrom the coins I collected to the grains we selected\nTo the plants out behind the barn\nIt\u2019s my life in a jar\n\n[Verse 2: Smo]\nNow as I got older my method got colder\nMy skills had developed to a full time roller\nDriving state to state and line to line\nWith a trunk full of Uncle Dave\u2019s best moonshine\nIt was that white lighting that blue flame burner\nThe best out the sticks with a smooth southern flavor\nNo chaser a high speed racer\nCountry boy running from them ATF Agents\nBack roads kickin\u2019 up dust like a chicken fight\nNavigate the sunset to keep me out the city lights\nSpare tank of gas I can run 'em on E\nBlue lights and sirens would never stop me\nNo trace tint with no plates\nI was out like a light hit my destination safe\nIt\u2019s just another day an outlaw in a car\nTryin\u2019 to double up these dollars fillin\u2019 up these jars\nThis is just\n\n[Chorus: CB3]\nMy life in a jar\nIt sure has takin\u2019 me so far\nFrom the coins I collected to the grains we selected\nTo the plants out behind the barn\nIt\u2019s my life in a jar\n\n[Verse 3: Smo]\nNow the coins pile to cash but so did the grain\nAnd all this rippin\u2019 and runnin\u2019 was driving me insane\nThe times have changed and so did the game\nIt was too much risk driving state to state\nPlus the soil was as rich as our aspirations\nGot the right seeds and started cultivating\nPatiently waiting with daily preparation\nAnd inch by inch we would reach out destination\nTwelve feet tall like a cedar bush\nSweet skunk crossbread with that O.G. Kush\nIt was prime to push and the block was right\nAnd once again we filled the jars and put the lids on tight\nWe was ground shipping through them big brown trucks\nAnd we knew that it was risky but we pushed our luck\nBoxed and ducted sealed with a secret touch\nI put my life in these jars just to earn a buck\nI keep living\n\n[Chorus: CB3]\nMy life in a jar\n[Smo]Simple life baby\nIt sure has takin me so far\n[Smo]Knee high to a grass hoper to a grown man\nFrom the coins I collected to the grains we selected\nTo the plants out behind the barn\nIt\u2019s my life in a jar\n\n[Outro: CB3]\nYeah that\u2019s right just collecting money as a kid\nEarning a dollar as a teenager\nAnd trying to start a business as a grown man\nYou can mix all that tall up and put it in a good old mason jar\nAnd that\u2019s my life baby\nOne step at a time year after year"}], "artist": "SMO"}
