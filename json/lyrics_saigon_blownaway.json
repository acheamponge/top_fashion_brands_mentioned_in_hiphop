Kennedy fought for the people\nA white president, that wanted to see all of us equal\nAt least that was what he said when running for office to be to\nBut then he won and started doing more for the people\nAssassin hit him with a bullet that tore his cerebral\nI know a lot of y'all thinking ''we wanna believe you''\nBlack people prayed for JFK\nBut bang, he got blown away\nSame way, Gosh, I can't forget Peter Tosh\nIf Bob Marley was Jigga then Tosh would be Nas\nPeter was Bob right hand man, one hand washed\nAll of these brothers wanted more than to just to be large\nKiller on the guitar, but better up on the mic\nY'all remember the revolutionary shit that he would write?\nLike \"get up, stand up, stand up for your right\"\nBang, he got blown away\nYou damn right\n\nMartin Luther King had more than a dream\nHe was out for social change and that sort of a thing\nTried to lead us to freedom, but before it would ring\nHe got blown away\n2Pac Shakur was more than a rapper, more than an actor\nIt was more than awards he was after\nHe tried to teach young, black people a better way\nHe got blown away\nThen there was Saigon, I brought you the greatest story\nI know they watching me, I know that they waiting for me\nI just pray that y'all heed what I had to say\nBefore I get blown away", "album": "The Greatest Story Never Told 2: Bread And Circuses"}], "artist": "Saigon"}
