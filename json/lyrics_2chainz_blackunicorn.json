And here you are, a black unicorn\nMythical, mystical, since the day that you were born\nMastered all the madness, let the magic have his way\nLet the power paint the day, let the god have his say\nCause there's a place that you can go, no one else is allowed\nSitting up on your cloud, so high when you look down\nJust glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found\nThen know that you can stop your search, cause love is all around\n\n[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]\nFree at last, free at last\nThat's what I said when I got out my last deal\nSome people can't relate\nSleep is the cousin of death, that is some Nas shit\nAnd when it's cold outside, so your pipes won't bust\nTurn on your faucet\nDrip, fuck the water bill, we stay in apartments\nAnd everything is a obstacle\nWhen they watching you, the hospital needs a hospital\nNow they mocking you, they say the flattery is sincere\nI rhyme like a nigga younger than me by ten years\nYeah, and that's my car talking\nOld school running with the dogs barking\nHop out that bitch like I'm sellin' coffins\nWeed so strong, I be seldom coughing\nAnd I'm covered in Balmain\nInstagram pics of my lobster omelette\nSelling that Parkay, life ain't no arcade\nNow I got more nines than the fourth grade\n\n[Hook: Chrisette Michele]\nFreedom, it's all I really want\nIt's all I really want to be\nIt's all I really need\nI want, I want and I believe\nYou thought you had the best of me\nBut now I'm what you need\n\n[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]\nHear ye, hear ye, you can't come near me\nCompetition best to fear me\nLyrically I could be Talib Kweli\nBut with gold teeth, it'd be hard for some to believe\nI leave them pussies stinking, they need Summer's Eve\nI practiced repetition, I need 100 G's\n100 M's, hug and squeeze, Dad kept this in the dungarees\nI'm not a rat but I love the cheese\nI change hoes like I change gears\nAnd my yard so big I got pet deers\nAnd my homies try to act like I ain't real\nI put my apron on, I taught myself how to make meals\nYou need a focus group, my group focused\nHit them loco jokers with the hocus pocus\nI'm the dopest, you can quote this\nUnderscore, it's just me and dope\nDirty ass niggas, we'll sell your ass a ki of soap\nI done seen them rich, I done seen them broke\nI done seen it all, watched a pregnant lady smoke\nWhen the baby come out, he gon' be geeked\nYou never know, he might come out to feed me\n\n[Hook: Chrisette Michele]\nFreedom, it's all I really want\nIt's all I really want to be\nIt's all I really need\nI want, I want and I believe\nYou thought you had the best of me\nBut now I'm what you need"}], "artist": "2 Chainz"}
