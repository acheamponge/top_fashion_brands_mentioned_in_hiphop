We've swept this place\nYou've got nothing, nothing but your bloody knives\nAnd your fancy karate gimmicks, we have guns\n\tNo, what you have are bullets\n\tAnd the hope that when your guns are empty, I'm no longer standing\n\tBecause if I am, you'll all be dead before you've reloaded\nThat's impossible! Kill him\n\n[Intro: 9th Prince]\nYeah, yeah, yeah, you know what it is, yo\n\n[9th Prince]\nAiyo, staring at the blank piece of paper\nThinking how can I express my anger\nFirst of all, any jail time, is hard labor\nIf I blow, my baby moms probably catch the vapors\nI stand tall as a skyscraper\nHead in the cloud like Air Force lasers, on Riker's Island\nNiggas playing tag with razors, police gunning\nI run it like the Portland Trail Blazers, but this ain't full court\nIt's more like verbal bloodsport, dope fiends coming up short\nA few lines in my notebook, I write like I snort\nBut I don't get high, on my own supply\nTransport us when they transport, Killarm' gun report\nVocabulary falling out my mouth piece, my wisdom is deep\nLike Malcolm X when he speakers, four door bulletproof jeep\nSo when I creep through these dark streets\nI leave niggas flat like slow leaks\n\n[Chorus: Islord]\nCheck that lyrical disaster, 9th Prince will mash ya\nWith that four-four automatic, niggas don't want static, yeah, yeah\nYeah, what what what, yeah you don't want no static, nigga\nCheck that lyrical disaster, 9th Prince will blast ya\nWith that four-four automatic, niggas don't want static, yeah, yeah\nYeah, what what what, yeah you don't want no static, nigga\n\n[9th Prince]\nAiyo, I speak from old school days of gangstas with gold teeth\nJewel thieves, corporate thugs\nKillas who put hands on former colleagues\nRun up in your crib, put these hollow heads in your seeds\nIced out stop watch, I'm bringing 'em back\nTime is moving fast, It's eleventh song, waving a mack\nI sleep hazardous, with the AK-47 underneath my mattress\nMe and my Killarm', we gang bang models and actresses\nThe black James Bond living lavish\nMy vision is clear, like daytime skylines\nCock it back, I watch the rhyme blast like a nine\nMy bars is bullets, pulvarize your spine\nCaught up in the midst of crime, I had to do time\nBack to the situation, with the God U Nation\nBust my gun on the devil's plantation\nI'm a one time felon, put four in your melon\nLeave your head swelling, now the hood call you Big Head Melvin\nCriticize my life, I have niggas kidnap your babies, while I'm raping\nYour wife, aight?\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[9th Prince]\nThis is a global warming, my rhyme rain acid rain whenever I'm brainstorming\nNiggas be calling me the Transformer, because I be transforming\nTo the planet of stars, pretty bitches and fly cars\nFreeing people from behind bars\nI was sent by Allah, don't get it twisted, your face will get scarred\nYou will remember me, the rest of your life\nI dig deep into your soul, like being cut by a sharp knife\nAll I do is meditate, all my life I had to set a nigga straight, no debate\nFeel the hate, 9th Prince the God, so keep your faith\nShopping rocks on plates, supply the tri-state\nNew York demonstrate on how I illustrate\nStacking up G's the size of wedding cakes\n\n[Chorus]", "year": null, "title": "Lyrical Disaster", "image": "https://images.genius.com/af61f0ef977c2f691226fe0ab315bfd9.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
