Snooze, catching Z's look forgot to cop a plea\nBut as far as god goes, I would say god is deceased\nWait, I would say god is in me\nJealously turns into murder cause some pride is vanity\nEgo 'come Yeezy therefore insanity\nCatch my thoughts into the seas let them swim with manatees\n2055, mine is finally out the freezer\nWelcome back as King Diamond with a new gat that's green\nFresh out the institution that arrived at the zone three\nBut I chose a different terminal in the eyes of the merciful\nWho murder fools, who get trapped inside a maze\nNow something is unusual, like Keanu Reeves cubicle\nA Matrix, invasion until I'm rapping whole and take tricks\nForsaken with these lead bullets she laced with\nWas taken from from existence left with Jason\nThe future I look upon with amazement\nIs just a trick with a face lift, Pissing on these peons as a hate gift\n\nI'm shroomed out\n\n[Outro: Big Rube]\nThe matter is grey, not simply black or white\nLeft or right the true path is opaque and vicious ?\nThe future is embued with golden anticipation\nFaith like time never moving in a straight line\nThe arc of destiny stretching out like a rainbow through the cosmos\n40 years can pass by in the blink of an eye\nDid I truly live life or simply ride the sands as they tumbled through the hour glass\nHolding on the fine moments is like grasping water\nAlways there, yet always slipping away\nLusting for more than we need\nLeading to the greed of acquisition\nAnd the gluttony of position\nA future that feels far but all too close\nOne that could be sublime if we didn't fall behind in the times from our refinement of the mind\nThe state of my people is altered but my faith is completely unfaltered\nGibraltar"}], "artist": "Denzel Curry"}
