I once knew this fast chick, mad thick, flava\nHeard some ghetto girls had words and it made her\nSteamed like hot water, thinkin shit's sweet\nRunnin lip 'til she crashed the whip her pop bought her\nThe night before Christmas, all through the house\nAll you could smell was the smoke from her, huffin a ounce\nThen she went drivin, still smokin herb\nStarted to swerve, hit a hydrant {*errrr*}\nBanged in the front grill, one ill hoochie she is\nDrove off pumpin +Lo+, \"Luchini\" remix\nThis female would smack kids, a little more than active\nThis bitch was way out of control like rap is\nReckless! {*boom*} Huh\nOpen your eyes and see it's unwise to be\nReckless! {*boom*} You know you need to calm down y'knahmsayin?\nYou can't do this\n\nYo - one of my boys got shot in the throat\nHe used to break day on the block, sellin coke\n5-for-20 seller, no girlie hassles\nDirty rascal, never showered, smell worse than 30 assholes\n(You stink!) Flamboyant, but made bad decisions\nHad a attitude (fuck y'all) went rags to riches\nDid some time on the Island and THEN\nHe came back home and now he whylin again\nReckless! {*boom*} Yo\nOpen your eyes and see it's unwise to be\nReckless! {*boom*} Y'knahmsayin?\nOpen your eyes and see it's unwise to be..", "year": null}]}
