I think\n\n[Hook]\nI had no idea who you were\nShould have took my time\nAnd opened my eyes\nI had no idea who you were\nShould have took my time\nBut my love was blind\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nYou was insecure, jealous hearted, slight retarded\nI was nauseous, I was marching back and forth, and you was forcin' me to forfeit\nFemale fraudulent, you female doggin' it\nIt's like extortion on my heart and shit\nI probably fell for it, cause you was gorgeous\nNow your course, done ran it's courses, and of course you know I'm exhausted\nTime you know I surely lost it\nShould of been wiser, should of been cautious\nShould of been tighter with my game\nI chose a dame that chose to entertain drama and what remains\nIs hate, so fuck your fucking name\nYou fake and live in a hall of shame\nMaterialistic, egotistic, thirsty bitches\nOpen house, and mouth for niggas to stick they dick in\nThought you was different, but you wasn't\nTake that back, I wish I would of just fucked with your cousin\nAss was fat, but never mind that\nWe out here fussin', fightin'\nAsk your friends to give advice, but they just like you\nClashing like some titans, could have broadcasted on pay-per-view\nPromise that you never break a promise, should I trust you?\nNow you only go for condoms, on late nights just because you, with the bull shit\n\n[Hook]\nI had no idea who you were\nShould have took my time\nAnd opened my eyes\nI had no idea who you were\nShould have took my time\nBut my love was blind"}], "artist": "Terrace Martin"}
