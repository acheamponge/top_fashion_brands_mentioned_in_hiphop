(Hey)\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nWhen the last time you think 'bout me? Hey\nProlly the last time the drinks on me, hey\nWhen the last time you think 'bout me?\nProlly the last time the drinks on me\nWhen the last time you think 'bout me? Hey (So when did you get like this?)\nProlly the last time the drinks on me, hey (When did you get like this?)\nWhen the last time you think 'bout me? (When did you get like this?)\nProlly the last time the drinks on me (When did you get like this?)\nWhen the last time you think 'bout me? Hey (I don't know)\nProlly the last time the drinks on me, hey (When did you get like this?)\nWhen the last time you think 'bout me? (I don't know)\nProlly the last time the drinks on me, hey"}]}
