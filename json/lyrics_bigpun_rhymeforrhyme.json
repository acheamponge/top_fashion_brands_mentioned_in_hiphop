The way I rhyme I leave precision\nUntil your mind freak your mic out in each position\nThe 5 40 out piped out with deep dishes\nCheck the flow, never test it yo\nI manifest it like drug connects pitch and blow\nDestined for greatness, check they way my necklace glow\nFake niggas' hate this. You think something sweet about me?\nCome taste this, 9 in your face kid"}], "artist": "Big Pun"}
