Then seek anger management\nCuz my cannon kick back, with a gangsta metal\nWent right through your rib rack, and kissed the devil\nFrom the slang, now your brain is a twisted pretzel\nIn the empty hallway, you can hear the echo\nDon't get petro', U-Godzilla stomped in the metro\nGet wild like techno, collect the dough\nFor wreck, the side ball and better check your ho\nDon't get mad, cowboy, just respect my glow\nJust another episode, powerful breath control\nExplodes in your ear, you can't hear me in death mode\nIn retrospect, you best Protect Ya Neck\nOr get slapped the fuck up, by my next cassette, hear me?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[U-God]\nThis - is - the - warrior's anthem\nPose, in the pictures with the golden guns, handsome\nPhantom of the opera, frantic in the mansion\nThe head banger boogie got 'em dancin' in the Hamptons\nYou panickin', one strike, get murdered up quick\nAnd the mic's my life, and I'm surgical with this\nSwift and wreckless, smoke blunts for breakfast\nMaster the game, this is chess, not checkers\nFeel me? Bone collector, just, vision my art\nIn the darkness, vulture's come and, pick you apart\nOne rusty steel spike pierce, straight through the heart\nI bleed for my Clan, don't let 'em, break us apart\nStrong as Noah's Ark, in the Biblical age\nStill, holdin' the Clan, in it's critical stage\nEngage in combat, beyond shadows of doubt\nWu-Tang claim supremacy, son, I'm airin' out\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: U-God]\nYo, man, if you was real, nigga\nYou would say niggas names, man\nYou ain't real dude, man, stop playing, man\nYou scared of niggas, niggas is runnin' with yo fuckin' name\nYou ain't doing shit, bitch, worry about your own shit\nTalkin' about niggas can't talk this shit\nFuck, I've been doing this, nigga\nI don't know what the fuck you talking about\nTake over projects, and set up shop, quick fast", "title": "You Don\u2019t Want to Dance", "year": null, "album": "Mr. Xcitement"}], "artist": "U-God"}
