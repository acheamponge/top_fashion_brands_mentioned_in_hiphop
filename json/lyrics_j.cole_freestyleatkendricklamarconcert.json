Cole]\nThe game need balance, the game need balance\nWoke up this morning to the rumors of niggas wilding\nPicture me hating on a young nigga with talent\nAlbum flop, but it's cool, he caked out on his allowance\nI was out in Vegas, Kicks was the latest\nBitch was the baddest, her head was the greatest\nOnly one thing that I ask of you haters\nYou can't diss a nigga if you got him on your playlist\nFrom straight A's to A-list, Only niggas with AK's can play this\nMy Jordan's thirteen like eighth grade, You niggas debaters\nBut you ignoring my pay raise\nI made it from 8 dollars an hour, that's 400 a week\nTo 100 grand a show, that's 400 a week\nIce and wrist, It's Cole summer to keep\nLife's a bitch, Just don't cum in the sheets"}], "artist": "J.
