Mind's lurking, that's the hurt I'm on\nRappers don't want beef, eat that sirloin\nWhat's that steak in my fate in my verbal throne\nNo pun intended, a nigga was born to run the business\nAccount balances always tellin me my funds is spending\nTryna have a beach house, invite tons of women\nDive in a water slide, ain't no fun in swimming\nAnd you know they from exotic places\nBlack and white girls, man I'm not a racist\nA house so big couldn't find a basement\nWe tryna move up but we climb adjacent\nPreviously these goals is just manifested\nCause right now my pockets looking anorexic\nGot a vision for my future that my plans are hectic\nNigga, mass appeal", "title": "STAIRWELL FREESTYLE"}]}
