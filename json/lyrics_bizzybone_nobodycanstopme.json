What are you goin' through?\nIf you only knew, if only you knew\nWhat are you goin' through? What are you goin' through?\nIf you only knew\n(Nobody can stop me Damn)\nNobody can stop me, now Nobody can stop me, now\nWhat are you goin' through? What are you goin' through?\nIf you only knew\n(Nobody can stop me)\nWhat are you goin' through? What are you goin' through?\nIf you only knew, if you only knew\n\n(Bizzy)\nLook at my sister sadden when my baby's mammy\nLike she can't stand me\nSay family be the first to turn so penny ante\nFilamina, my granny, celebrate the Grammy damn\nNobody knew no plannin' was so perfect\nRollin' on damn E., never forget the Bones\nTrippin' on foster homes\nThinkin' I wasn't manly with a scarred up soul\nBut I keep my skeletons, understand me\nWhat if I said I was molested?\nWould you look at me pale?\nBut I keep on bailin'\nAnd I hope I don't go to hell stressed, I wail\nCan I sell my bio? I was born in Ohio\nAlready on trial\nCause Pops said I looked too light, but moms is white\nBut I still had your smile\nAnd look at me now gotta be proud of myself\nAin't nobody else soundin' so worried about my health\nAnd all the while takin' care of my kids\nHow would they live?\nIf I ain't hustlin', strugglin', (trustin') still keepin' Jesus a part of\nSolution\nHe gives life in the lungs\nBreath through the tongue\nNow here it comes\nNow, here it comes; and here we go\n\n(chorus)\nNobody can stop me, now Nobody can stop me, now\nNobody can stop me, now Nobody can stop me, now\nIf only you knew\nWhat am I goin' through, goin' through, goin' through?\n\n(Bizzy)\nAnd my mama took plenty beatings\nNow in her third damn marriage and man\nActin' like he cares apparently 'til you perish\nBut I was always there for you\nEven though you let me leave he's beatin' the shit outta me, too\nProbably why I got my bodyguards\nAnd I'm in charge\nWatch me sleep the pay is meek\nBut stay with me\nAnd keep my heart collateral, we'll never break apart\nY'all didn't see me with Eazy, as a child of God\nWith the underdog\nNever applaud once you reminisce through the ball\nMovin' in Heaven's movie\nY'all, think of all that fucked-up shit you saw\nOnly if you knew what I was goin' through\n\n(chorus)\nWhat am I goin' through, goin' through, goin' through?\nIf only you knew\nNobody can stop me, now nobody can stop me, now\nNobody can stop me, now nobody can stop me, now\nIf only you knew\nWhat am I goin' through, goin' through, goin' through?\n\n(Bizzy)\nFlashback to me with the weight of the world\nCan't stop my girl from steppin'\nLookin' for affection in wrong places\nMy lesson be learned world turns\nThe early bird gets the worm\nWhat if it's rotten while you rushin' for love and get burned?\nFive kids, that's my only concern\nI was a father before I became a man society don't comprehend\nCallin' me worthless but I could purchase what they purchase\nBut I understand behind closed curtains you workin' on being a man\nDeath scares me\nBut Jesus will prepare me\nAnd hopefully repair me\nAs god would want him to, really really\nGhetto media see the thug\nWash your sins\nThen it's true you can be born again\n\n(chorus) (repeat till end)\nWhat am I goin' through, goin' through, goin' through?\nNobody can stop me, now Nobody can stop me, now\nNobody can stop me, now Nobody can stop me, now"}], "artist": "Bizzy Bone"}
