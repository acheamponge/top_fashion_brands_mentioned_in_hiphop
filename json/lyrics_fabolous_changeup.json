But I stresses you to holla\nCause they never made bullet proof vest-es out of dollars\nWe never change, this is us every day\nI call them boys up, they gon' bust every 'K\nThey ride high like them cust' Chevrolets\nLike O-Wax for Kaine, lookin for his cousin killers\nI got a dozen peelers for niggas who doesn't feel us\nI changed for a reason but homey it wasn't scrilla\nThey can't say that nuttin changed but my clothes\nOh, I'm lyin, I do change up my hoes\nI pitch game you should see the change-up I throws\nAnd gotta get 'em a ring to get 'em to swing\nI'm a team player, if I win then we won\nAnd they gon' put us all in the Hall of Fame when we done\n\n[Hook 1] + [Hook 2]\n\n[Fabolous]\nMoney can't buy happiness but it's a damn good down payment\nI don't talk much, feel like I'm around agents\n... the game ain't what it used to be\nI'm the same but these lames ain't used to me\nThem other niggas, be full of theyselves\nGet money and disappear, try to pull a Chappelle\nWell - I ain't hidin I'm ridin; I ain't duckin I'm buckin\nI ain't hangin I'm bangin; I ain't willin I've done it\n\n[Hook 1] + [Hook 2]", "title": "Change Up"}]}
