Hey...\n\n[1st Verse: Sammy Adams]\nTook off on the red line\nTrain to the city\nBackpack, black jeans, dirty tee\nLookin' pretty\nStarvin' to cop some sneakers\nGets off when it stops at Harvard\nBut Concepts ran out of Jordans\nThe same pair that he wanted\nDips, heads on to Boston\nCrosses over the river\nLookin' over the Charles\nReflections off of the building\nSox roll into Fenway\nUp 5 on the Yankees\nJumps off of the bar\nAnd he's off right out of State Street\nNext day, there's some bombers\nThem cowards, they try to level\nSome people there for a marathon\nOrdered straight from the devil\nThen a certain magazine\nRolling Stone, So aware of it\nDecided to give a cover to a motherfuckin' terrorist\nOlder class, be ashamed, don't need him now\nEspecially seeing them kick him when he's on the ground\nOn the way to being better than it ever was\nComeback season, know its only love\nHomecoming (Echo)\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Sammy Adams]\nHe moved away to play ball\nScholarship to take off\nAthletics kept him busy\nWas killin' it, 'til the late fall\nFour goals in four games\nTwo gamewinners\nWas All-American bound to All-American finished\nTrainer took a couple looks and motioned game over\nPain couldn't touch how hurt he be\nFrom all these hangovers\nGet it out\nStarted producing\nMind straight from him losing\nThe only thing that he knew since age 2\nChucked up the deuces\nWrote a song about his college with no fuckin' idea\nThat the words that he was writing\nWould catapult his career\nThen he took off\nDecided fuck the books and be his own boss\nTraded taking classes and practice\nTo learn his show cause\nRoad less traveled\nNot rattled by all the ruckus\nShortly moved to the city\nAnd toured the country on buses\nStayed loyal to the fans\nBut he didn't see the storm coming\nWanted to blow up\nBut didn't know it'd explode on him\nHomecoming\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Sammy Adams]\nHe signed a deal, so surreal\nIn the thick of it\nBut damn he missed home\nOnce the world was at his fingertips\nSolidified a team for the dream\nHomie lost a few\nTo just a fuckin' year ago\nWe thought would be impossible\nBest friends stay close\nNever gave him shit\nCause he was busy doing work\nWhen they were busy gettin' lit\nHe said, Fuck all the glits\nWasn't planing to get rich\nTill the fans spoke\nAfter Wizzy [?] became the shit\nLifestyle switching, learning from mistakes\nHurting from missing out on the surface\nBut wouldn't break\nIn his flight from the west coast\nTouch down at Logan\nDidn't check a thing\nBut all the baggage he was holding\nGoddamn\nBack to the city\nThat made him home with the garden\nJumped back in his truck\nThat his brother had when he started\nFresh air from the summer\nSlowly fading to fall\nEast coast boy made it after all\nThis is Homecoming", "album": null}], "artist": "Sammy Adams"}
