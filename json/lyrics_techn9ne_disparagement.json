can't stop what's divine, no\nSo why in the hell are you trying for\nThe Cayenne flow got you dying slow\n'Cause my info got the Zion glow\nThey don't like seeing Tecca the N9ne go\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nThey said I'm evil\nThey said I'm totally demon in my cerebral\nThey callin' me criminal, comin' to curse a cathedral\nTo punish the positive, opposin' the peace of the people\nThey said I'm a dreamer, and not a good singer\nThat'll never get bread and no kind of Heaven'll bring ya\nWhen I lessen the N9na\nOppressin' the Tech and left in the ringer\n'Cause I am the effin' best with the lingua\nCalling me failure when you know Tech is a choppin' impaler\nIt's funny when you rolling, they come and try to derail ya\nThe tale fell to hell bruh\nNothing you tell her is stopping me when I nail her\nShe loving the delta\nThe hate gon' show but the faith gon' grow\n'Cause I am a winner and gonna make strong dough\nWhen I take on flow, when the pace don't slow\nIt's comedy saying that Aaron Yates won't blow\n(Yates won't blow, Yates won't blow\nYates won't blow, Yates won't blow)\nYou did this, how you live with the stupidness\nKnowing when I get loose, it get lucrative\nWho can sit through this and boo 'cause it blew to bits\nDoofus is not a muse, it's a duplicate\nRiddle me, riddle me, yo why does a little league\nIn second fiddle belittle me when it'll be literally\nKilla B's on the milla spree to drill 'em and filler flee\nAin't no illa G, reala B, the skill is agility\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nWhen they be itching to down ya\nThrowing the hate all around ya\nTo all the people that clown ya\nBut not a sound when they come encounter\nA real one, they don't feel none\nSwear you're sitting on just little crumbs\nWhen you really making multi-millions\nWhen they say you lost it, but the deal's done\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah, yeah, but they really love this arrogance and now my angel flair is sent to give you that embarrassment\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah, yeah, but they really love this arrogance and now my angel flair is sent to give you that embarrassment\n\n[Verse 2: King Iso]\nIt's crazy what haters say when creating a narrative\nI will flatten 'em all like they ain\u2019t put no air in it\nMedia maybe is airing it and made a few errors\nIt doesn't matter, money\u2019s made and many take and are sharing it\nNobody's thinking about the way that they carry us, they are precarious\nFallin' like the angel that flared up and hated comparisons\nWhen I think about native Americans being named by some terrorists\nI ain\u2019t say it in Arabic homie!\nI figured I could make it apparent like babies in carriages, but this ain't related to marriages\nWhen I say I'm separated from a lady that merited liberty later that buried it and made me a heretic\nThey are taking our heritage to the grave\nInnocent but say we're nefarious, now we hang\nBut them people are fake as a fairy is on the gang\nPut a target on their face then I can 'em like it\u2019s a bang (ugh)\nThey ain't prepared for this, I made it so there it is\nSo they throw the shade in areas grayer than Meredith\nTuck a .50 for the shade like Anastasia, I'm airing it out 'cause\nLiving nowadays man it be stranger than Aaron is\nThey paint you in this light and try to make you a derelict\nGrammys ain't giving any love to Strange and I'm very sick\n'Cause N9na's on the throne but then he say I'm heir to it\nFake ish won't fly like a cape with a tear in it\nDemons swinging low not at your face, call them sweet chariots\nYou know how many people that grew up and they don't say what their parents did?\nGood could\u2019ve been that, but it could\u2019ve been bad, so your beliefs be careful with\nI'm sitting in the nuthouse looking at my freaking therapist like\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah, yeah, but they really love this arrogance and now my angel flair is sent to give you that embarrassment\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah, yeah, but they really love this arrogance and now my angel flair is sent to give you that embarrassment\n\n[Bridge: Tech N9ne]\nWhen they be itching to down ya (ayy)\nThrowing the hate all around ya (ayy)\nTo all the people that clown ya\nBut not a sound when they come encounter\nA real one, they don't feel none\nSwear you're sitting on just little crumbs\nWhen you really making multi-millions\nWhen they say you lost it but the deal's done\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah, yeah, they really love this arrogance and now my angel flair is sent to give you that embarrassment\nYeah yeah, this is called disparagement\nYeah yeah, this is called
