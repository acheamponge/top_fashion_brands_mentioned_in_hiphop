Uh huh\nWhen it's thugs in King's coats and Raider's caps\nKillers, jerry curls, and baseball bats\nReady to die like everyday\nI put it down like a muthafucka, everyday\nI drink brew and smoke weed like, everyday\nAnd we all trying to get paid but anyway\nKillas don't talk, but this one do\nTalk you out your wallet let the 45 blast you\nTwice in the chest, once in the face\nPlus the extra heater on the safe side in case\nYour bitch is wack well she can catch one too\nCause if you're down with your hood\nThen your hood down with you\n\nI put it down for the hood\nI ride for the hood\nAnd all my muthafuckas is up to no good\nCause everybody in the hood is trying to come up\nSo gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck\nI put it down for the hood\nI ride for the hood\nAnd all my muthafuckas is up to no good\nCause everybody in the hood is trying to come up\nSo gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck\n\nPsychopathic just like thugs\nWe ball, and we fight\nAnd just like the freaks I come out every night\nHoldin' down the sidewalk\nStandin' amongst muthafuckas that's soon to be outlined in chalk\nSippin' on a cold ass 40 of OE\nLive from the DET we OG\nPissy drunk always, we dead bumpin'\nStay thug with the throw away in the trunk\nBitch slapper, fuck a bitch rapper\nBitches were made for fuckin' but that's another chapter\nBitch you don't know me, don't approach me\nThinkin' that you're down with Blaze ya dead homie\nG Blood imbedded in street blocks\nThat's why I put it down, and blast with many shots\nBullet holes in my chest, it's all good\nMan I even died for my hood, muthafucka\n\nI put it down for the hood\nI ride for the hood\nAnd all my muthafuckas is up to no good\nCause everybody in the hood is trying to come up\nSo gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck\nI put it down for the hood\nI ride for the hood\nAnd all my muthafuckas is up to no good\nCause everybody in the hood is trying to come up\nSo gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck"}], "artist": "Blaze Ya Dead Homie"}
