A$AP Rocky, Angel Haze, Childish Gambino and Joey Bada$$\nC'mon, splash em son\n\n[Verse 1: Angel Haze]\nI came here with one intention: to kill this\nI'm talking head in my hands, mouth on that drill ish\nI be on that wired insane, ultimate trill shit\nAnd there is not a soul that can see me\nLike I'm not real trick\nListen up niggas I'm tired of you lames\nI'm hungry and you looking like entire food chains\nAnd uh, it's to the point that I ain't even got to try hard\nSpittin' like a lake in hell, but bitches like my God\nPlus niggas flicking lenses on me like a tripod\n'Cuz they know there's only one eye, like cyclops\nYou know I beat 'em to the count, to the points love\nI swear I never even lost in a coin toss\nSo bow down mothafuckas, if you talking deep shit I\u2019ll out drown mothafuckas\nSomebody find my rocker cause I'm literally off it\nI'm in the murder business I just spit you bitches a coffin\n\n[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]\nYo, til the day I die, I be puffing lye\nFuck the world, fuck it dry\nTell them government spies I won't cover my eyes\nWon't cower, won't move, cause I don't move like a coward\nKnowledge is power and the flower of life is ours\nGet as high as ours, maybe you can see the towers\nScour your dirty mind and maybe you'll unleash the power\nWe all got the potential in our body and soul\nProbably you know I found mines right through the pencil\nStarted bodying flows, but fuck that\nThis be the preview of primeval hip-hop retrieval\nI hold illegal like them coppers hold weasels to Squeal\nThis one for my people, heading to the top, no re-do\nThinking up evil but see no evil just be Knievel\nYou can't be this good they just made me better\nThey told me cheese at the cams and they made me cheddar\nAnd the green only made me better\nSee, God made three Bigs, 2 Pacs but he only made one era, The Era\n\n[Verse 3: Driicky Graham]\nSwear you guys slipping like some ice on a bridge\nSince diapers and bibs\nThe light skin has been quite nicer than how Mike was to kids\nCypher rhyming, Rikers Island, spending nights with the pen\nEither that or cyber-Skyping with a dyke and her friend\nShe telling me, she gon' take my cock to her lips\nSuffice to my wish, saliva and recycle my kids, gulp\nI'm the best, it's hard to lose hope\nI'm spitting rappers out like orange juice pulp\nAnd looking in the mirror like aren't you dope\nYou so clean motherfucker you should hardly use soap\nSomething sinister, raps that minister\nYou mortals don't want combat, I'll block and finish ya\nI'm seriously dope, I'm crack, I'm venomous\nAnd you are seriously poked in your crack by ministers\nEww, these days rappers on my TV\nAre braggers about their swagger rocking karats off of Ebay\nBut I ain't tripping, I like groupie women\nWho be sendin' chills up your spine when you see they booty switching\nFast cars with the kufi missing, that's top off\nPop off, I'm with my dawgs like Stewie Griffin\nNiggas hear me, be like ooh he be ripping\nAnd if your girl see me she catch that Driicky spank me, do me feeling\nOver the money I be pooky twitching\nAnd honestly about the beef I gives a fuck what who be Twittin'\n\n[Verse 4: Childish Gambino]\nStill good with a pen, no Joe Paterno\nI count Ninja Turtles, my cash flow concern them\nGambino you meet him, repping east side of the A hard\nGot the Black AMEX, I gotta pull the race card\nNiggas move that Kreayshawn, naw I don't carry mine\nWhy the game fucked up like my hairline\nAy girl, you ever smoke a bowl out with Kid Cudi?\nYou ever gotten D like you don't study?\nRap game in the fast lane, with a gas tank\nFilled with half of these trash lames\nI have to say I'm such a Joey's last name\nBino boy, why you spit so mean\nWhy the flow so rich girl, them sweet sixteens\nHe on BET and he got White people problems\n\"Like, Whole Foods doesn't have the juice I like so I have to go to, you know\nTrader Joe's and have it shipped to me\"\nVictory, history\nMore G than a kid's movie, Royalty\n\n[Verse 5: A$AP Rocky]\nMy name is Rock in the new drop, my destiny's to be the new Pac\nThat nigga Rocky gotta die, he too hot\nIt\u2019s dead on, must've been tripping and stepping in heron'\nCause I\u2019m cripping the lead on\nI\u2019m getting forensics twisting your head on\nTraffic, mad clips, caskets, pass this, ashes to ashes\nThat shit, backwards, tactics\nBitches only like me for my status\nLiving ghetto fabulous and I\u2019m still acting ratchet\nTwenty-four karats, no dressing with my salads\nNigga with the Patch kids, steady talking cabbage\nGot a chick red like radish, have it\nBitches think they bad til I drop them like habits\nNo one in this cyph' has swag like I do\nChurch with this verse, I'mma hit em with the gospel\nEver since a baby, ask my old lady\nMy first four words was, fuck you, pay me", "year": "2012-10-10"}]}
