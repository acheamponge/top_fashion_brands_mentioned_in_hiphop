(My vibe)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, we caped up, ten in the lab, weapons to blast\nOne with the city, fight for sections of land\nCan't sleep till the check's in my hand\nIt's still a hustle, bare knuckle grind knee deep inside the struggle\nI don't give a fuck about much but my beloved and such\n'Cause nobody to trust but us\nIt's New York life, walk like what you talk like\nOr you might get tossed right off the ninth floor\nEvery day is war, rhoaming through the wasteland\nFocused, trying to make grands\nHammers poaking out the waistband\nIn this cash race, they can't stand the pace\nI plan to make millions and marinate\nAcross town my Fam is straight\nCash rules, so naturally it had me\nThe temptress teasing me, I lust badly\nShe said \"You want professional and records sold? Let it go\"\nAnd I replied \"This is the only life I'll ever know...\"\n\n[Hook]\n(It's the only life I'll ever know... You know?)\nI trust, in no one but us\nTrust, in no one but us\nTrust, in no one but us\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, years later, hey I made it, no explaining how\nWalking forward through the fire while it rain down\nWe claim Sex & Slang and aim weapons\nBut still trying to live the +Good Times+ like James Evans\nAnd, we'll stick you for your shine\n(Hustle) Nickel for a dime\n(Trouble) This you're gonna find\n(Muscle) If you wanna grind\n(Struggle) Digits on the mind\n(Couple) Figures for the crime\n(Scuffle) Fists or with the nine\n(Bubble) Living on the line (The line, the line...)\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just a city guy living fly getting high\nLive it till I die getting by, whipping by\nStand solidified big times to different sides\nHere's your ticket right, follow if you feel my vibe...
