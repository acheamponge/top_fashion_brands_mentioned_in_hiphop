Alla y'all\n\n[Tela]\nI started last night but now it's sunny\nLong run like Marie in Dunny(??)\nBitch on the side buggin, look honey\nAll I'm thinkin is, big money\nPussy don't come poke I don't fuck if I'm broke\nThat's how half these niggas done, lost they stroke\nNow, slide them lights and blow on my throw I\nShakes 'em twice through the air they float, point\nTwenty-five on the line (6 the easy way)\nThirteen in the field, 50 odds, oh my God\nMy whole table charged\nI picks up a hundred eighty-eight yards\nSparks, balloons, room, V.I.P. cards\n(Hook us up) You fuckers think y'all smart\nWho sent y'all?  Hey fuck y'all\nFuck these cards, I'm outta Dodge\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Tela]\nTowards the do' my ass done stopped\nYou guessed it, I'm at them slots\nI drops two rubber bands, why not?\nI'm up a hand at the MG Grand\nTwo mo' honeybuns the whole shit locked\nBig guns, seven across, jackpot\nMy ass is hot, I'm heated\nI'm scorch, I'm holdin it down, I'm runnin the court\nIn other words to make a long story short\n.. I know the fuckin sport\nI got the owner bout to shit his shorts\nI got the city on life support\nAfter this run I'ma sit and soak\nCause after this run, ain't SHIT broke\nAfter this run, I don't need to smoke\nI'ma get a bitch and get throwed on the boat"}], "artist": "Tela"}
