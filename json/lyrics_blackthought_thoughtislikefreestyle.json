Ya'll finna go see the therapist\nI gotta settle it black, metal to metal\nWith these brothers on that bullshit pot, calling the kettle crisp\nWhat could be better bitch? I'm rocking the flag with the green, black and red\nAnd you're on the confederate, boy, you work for Merill Lynch\nYa'll ain't fucking with a brother hell bent on success, I'm living evidence\nSee it's really all about sensation and the fascination\nWe got to chase it: dreams\nI'm trying to be the champ, you're in to racing\nCause fuck wasting time on the consolation prize\nSomething undetectable to ya'll naked eyes\nStill its probably more real than ya'll recognize\nI specialize in raw, carnivorous rhyming\nBetter silence it ya'll, you couldn't size it\nThe fourth horseman, give rise over the blade\nIts going to cut you to a different size\nIn the days of guerrilla warfare\nMaking a change, like carfare\nI want these chumps taken off here\nSip my morning coffee, kiss my baby girl\nTell my lady friend I'm gone until I save the world\nJump in my hotrod wheel, looking super thorough\nRocking an all black cape like the Duke of Earl\nThe essence of a movement on some smooth shit\nLangston Hughes mixed in with some Stanley Kubrick\nSick, still yet I'm savvy, penning a nasty masterpiece\nThat convey my sentiment exactly\nBlack: I'm that nice son from Michaelango or Michael Eric Dyson\nSlicing like a viking, dog, I'm white lightning\nI'm caught with a bone, with a slight tick in my mind\nIt's tight frightening\nThe flow is part Mozart and part Malcom\nClearly you ain't fearing, you already know the outcome\nAnother victory, we're making history\nI'm stronger than the walls in the penitentiary"}], "artist": "Black Thought"}
