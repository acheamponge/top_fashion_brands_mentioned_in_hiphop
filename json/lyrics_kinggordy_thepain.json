Knock you out, right in this ring\nSo you are a joke, containing no punch lines\nListening to the rhymes you wrote, waitin on the punch lines (Where you at?)\nI'm murdering this nigga. Merciless with scriptures\nBurning his ligaments, and serve him with your verses\nNigga, kill him\nMy hunger pains got my insides eatin themselves\nBut I love the pain; seein you die is a treat in itself\nSo many wicked ways - you're worthless like a bitch with AIDs\nGet served bitch, like a tennis game\nI'm trynna get blown and I'm very comfortably\nBut you rhymin, killin my buzz like a murdered bumble bee\nKing Berry Gordy's the name and I'm kicked stories thats strange\nAnd I came to take over your brain with unexplainable thangs\n\n[Hook]\n(The pain) I came to bring it\nIt seems you really need (the pain)\nI'm here to get wit you\nHit you wit, inflict you wit (the pain)\nIt's better than pleasure\nJust let me help you feel (the pain) (What!?) (The pain) (Come on!)\n(The pain) I came to bring it\nIt seems you really need (the pain)\nI'm here to get wit you\nHit you wit, inflict you wit (the pain)\nIt's better than pleasure\nJust let me help you feel (the pain) (What!?) (The pain) (Come on!)\n(The pain!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nStop lookin at me. And put the money in a big bag\nWit yo gay ass style, man you sound like you kiss fags\nWhat would possess you to diss me?\nI pull up in ten speeds putin holes in the side of your Bentley\nAlways talkin bout your 20 inches\nOr your bitches ridin 10 inches of dick, hittin switches\nI ain't no battle rapper\nBut I will gladly slap ya\nBlast on this bastard, trap him\nThen blast the nigga's adams apple\nWitness my shoot cops, just to get in to a chase and\nHit you in your rooftop, watch that shit come out his basement\nI ponder as I smoke dro\nHow can a fuckin gun so hot turn a body so cold?\nCause I got to braids stickin up, I'm just a rap character?\nJust because you look and sound like every rapper in America?\nFuck all your moves, you kickin\nSmack you for approval\nTouch your neck, locate your veins\nSo I can insert my fangs. It's\n\n[Hook]\n(The pain) I came to bring it\nIt seems you really need (the pain)\nI'm here to get wit you\nHit you wit, inflict you wit (the pain)\nIt's better than pleasure\nJust let me help you feel (the pain) (What!?) (The pain) (Come on!)\n(The pain) I came to bring it\nIt seems you really need (the pain)\nI'm here to get wit you\nHit you wit, inflict you wit (the pain)\nIt's better than pleasure\nJust let me help you feel (the pain) (What!?) (The pain) (Come on!)\n\n[Interlude]\nI came to bring the pain\nHardcore to the brain\nLet's go inside my astroplane\nI came to bring the pain!\nHardcore to the brain!\nLet's go inside my astroplane!\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe spirit of Pun and Biggie is in me\nMixed by the human beat box, and the switcher was sticky\nI be hittin you in your temple quickly\nYou're a wanksta, stop frontin, please listen to 50\nThese garbage MCs trynna give me beef\nLike I ain't starvin to eat\nSound so silly, like a girl when she's gettin boned swiftly\nA fan let me hit it just because I know Swifty from D12\nNow your female is goin home wit me\nNow every big person that has low self esteem\nWants to be a Fat Killah know, it's on they list of dreams\nWell, tell your momma she can not join us\nShe too enormous, must be under 400\nShe weighs more than 4 Corvettes\nDon't be mad at niggas all in the streets\nYou kicked your ass in '93 when niggas was callin you sweet\nWishin time can rewind youm King Gordy'll hide you\nIn a place so far away, God can't even find you!\n\n[Hook]\n(The pain) I came to bring it\nIt seems you really need (the pain)\nI'm here to get wit you\nHit you wit, inflict you wit (the pain)\nIt's better than pleasure\nJust let me help you feel (the pain) (What!?)
