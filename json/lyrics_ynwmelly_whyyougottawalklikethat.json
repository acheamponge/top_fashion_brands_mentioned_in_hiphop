(I'm tellin' you)\nBenz coupe, out a paper tag (I'm tellin' you)\nShorty say she like my swag (I'm smellin' it)\nForgiato rims on the Jag (I'm tellin' you)\nWhy you gotta walk like that? (I told her that)\nWhy you gotta talk like that? (I wanna know)\nSaid why you gotta walk like that? (I wanna know)\nI told her, baby it's that Florida boy swag (I told her that)\nLike why you gotta walk like that? (Why you gotta walk like that?)\nYeah, why you gotta talk like this? (Why you gotta talk like that?)\nYeah, why you gotta act like that? (Why you act?)\nForgiato rims on the Jag\n\n[Verse]\nForgiato rims on the Jag\nShawty see a nigga got that bag\nWe gon' up the Glizzy, then spaz\nOn trebles, we gon' drop a bag\nFree my nigga Donny, yeah\nFree my nigga, oh, yeah\nWhen we was skippin' school in the halls\nThese hoes was in that locker room suckin' on balls (Ayy)\nI got your bitch, but I don't ever pick up her call (Ayy)\nNever smell her drawers, never let her fuck with my keys\n'Cause all of my niggas some kings\nAnd they won't let me give her no accolades\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy you gotta walk like that? (I'm tellin' you)\nBenz coupe, out a paper tag (I'm tellin' you)\nShorty say she like my swag (I'm smellin' it)\nForgiato rims on the Jag (I'm tellin' you)\nWhy you gotta walk like that? (I told her that)\nWhy you gotta talk like that? (I wanna know)\nSaid why you gotta walk like that?
