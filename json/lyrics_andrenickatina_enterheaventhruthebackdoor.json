Set to go\nTiga let me know\nYa dig?\nA new version of the four four\nI'm a hit heaven like I hit the club - baby through the back door\nA new version of the four four\nI'm a hit heaven like I hit the club - baby through the back door\n\nA magical conversation I cut your ass down\nLike a block nigga hit by a 4-pound-right-now\nI swing the sticky like a golf ball\nReady itll pop ya'll Aimin at me gun\nAnd don't stop ya'll\nIf I could turn back the hands of time\nId sell coke in Miami say \"the world is mine\"\nSometimes my job expectations or court accusations\nHit the car with the weed and the navigation\nI keep a lolipop like Cojack\nI take a hoe nap\nUP in ya lap tell ya hold that Yea!\nThe Fillmoe King of the ryme, it's like I'm feeling for time\nMan you can wait but I'm scheming for mine\nCu cu cu gotta get the cabbage\nI'm living way mad and get the ke lup for the freak cause she speak spanish\nMan I ain't never been a copy cat\nI throw raps at any disc jockey back\nTennessee- call me little Denny, cause I'm ryhme ready\nThe big homies came and got me in a blue Chevy\nIt's like this, yea I gotta rattle the cage\nIf you wonder what I do-bitch I party for days\nI keep it hot like a heat wave, rollin around\nStand you up like some pins then I'm bowling you down\nSaid it before, yea I'm rhyme ready\nAnd when the suns down- Jamacian drug posse see me sayin \"come down\"\nDrank a little bit, me and vacko\nOnce again it's the pinzo Picasso"}]}
