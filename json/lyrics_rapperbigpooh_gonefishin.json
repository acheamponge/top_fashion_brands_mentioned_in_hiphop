You ain't got a camera?\nIt's all good, let me hear what you talkin' 'bout\nGirl sick, sight, voice, I'mma rub one out\nSo I checked on a plane ticket\nThe way my account set up, well, you don't wanna hear it\nYo, it's either train or bus\nSomebody gotta travel, if it's gonna be an us\nOh, you're busy next month?\nOh, the next three months?\n\n[Hook]\nI'm tryin' to get you home\nBaby girl I'm tryin' to get you home\nTryin' to get you, yeah\nI'm tryin' to get you home\nAnd I'm tired of talking over the phone\nI'm tryin' to get you home\nI'm tryin' to get you home\nNigga tired of talking over the phone\nI need to get you home\n\n[Bridge]\nIf you think you're lonely now\nThen wait until tonight girl\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm tired of playing this game\nWhat the fuck you waiting on? We need to finally set a date\nOnly so much time I can patiently wait\nIf I ain't with you looking forward to right now then I ain't\nCause I ain't, gon' keep dragging this along\nAnd I can't, play another sad song\nAnd I won't, keep chasing you online\nAnd I won't, so what we finna do, huh?\n\n[Outro]\nYou best to get on that bus\nGreyhound, Megabus\nYou better travel to see me\nI wanna see you\nI need you\nI want you\nOh\nYou better jump on the Amtrak, baby\nThe airbus, cop you a ticket\nPriceline\nYou best a-call William Shatner baby\nAnd get your tickets for cheap\nI want you"}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
