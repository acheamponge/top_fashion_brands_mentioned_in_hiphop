People are never happy with what they have\n\n[Verse 1]\nNever fear, shed a tear, every years changing\nSet a gear, let me ears, billy's rearrangin'\nIt\u2019s amazin', this box I'm caged in\nA haven for the layman\nMy aim's a raven\nBathin' in a base 'n' filled with litigation, I'm racin\u2019\nEach crowd I rock is a playpen\nI\u2019m playin' while I\u2019m pacin'\nPush harder on the cold pavement, I'm enslaved in\nMomma said I was a stubborn boy\nWho tore his rage in bull fed spice how to cage in\nMet a couple rap packs, and we stayed kin\nBlazed up and baked in, self preservation\nSet a strange coarse off on the trains in\nFelt like a strange skin\nNever been the same since\n'83 was the year that I came in, May 5th\nSay Ben, Why we wearin\u2019 aprons?\nIt's a hustle that I didn't sign up for\nBut gotta set bill quick, Fuck, goin' job core!\nI'm sicker than the average, rap-ridden rabbits\nTrack smilin' magic, no, I gotta have it\nIt's poetry or understandable garbage\nThe word pours, oh , so close to artists, but\nI'ma keep on keepin' each song, to free speech on deaf beats like Petong, I\nCan't hear you, image and egos\nSo won't know fear through the gimmicks you leave, so\nBe out of my peep-holes, silly ol' Neemo\nMore tricky fish than a peep show\nI'm rugged to the arsenic jingle\nThe lame airwaves make my cartilage tingle\nIt's enough to give a bag and a shingles\nIn this fake world, I mingle\nTo me it's all details\n\n[Chorus]\n(What'chu gonna do, do do, do do, do)\nIt's all details\n(What'chu gonna do, do do, do do, do)\nTo me it's all details\n(What'chu gonna do, do do, do do, do)\nYou see it's all details\n(What'chu gonna do, do do, do)\nThe devil's in the details\n(Do do, do do, do do, do)\nThe devil's in the details\n(Do do, do do, do do, do)\nThe devil's in the details\n(Do do, do do, do do, do)\nThe devil's in the details\n(Do do, do)\n\n[Verse 2]\nThese days MCs and DJs\nWalk through each maze with a girl named Cliche\nCar, chain, fake MC battle\nShake, roll, rattle, hoarse mic on a saddle that'll\nStraddle all prior push on our movement\nThey say that our music, is merely amusement\nAnd if it is, I've amused myself to death\nAnd EBAY'd off every last breath\nGoin' once, goin' twice, it's sold now\nSpreadin' the whole town, a segment of gold nouns\nWords fall off the wall like paint chips\nI'm biting my dazed lip, and hearing the same shit\nI'm only tryin' to breath\nThey want me to fly, but they wire my needs, see\nIn this circus I'm fire and greed\nA surplus got me dyin' to beed\nIt's all details\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro 1]\n*Ding*\nWhat's goin' on Burn?\nWhat up! What's the deal man?\nChillin'. Where you goin'?

Luther. Don't ever forget the Luther\nUmm...
