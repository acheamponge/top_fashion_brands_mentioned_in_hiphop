I\u2019m that guy, built so fly in a silk bow tie\nDon\u2019t know why I\u2019m built so fly\nBut I am, no lie\u2014oh my!\nRolled by on a lowride Huffy\nSitting on the pegs, shelltoes puffy\nCuff rolled up to my calf\nClass out the ass, bad with the swag like Buffy\nGotta be the one to bite the bullet\nI\u2019m a sinner, but I bet I could've been a better man\nI wanna be Zen, but I go sippin' on some medicine\nInstead of meditating, but I get it when I can\nI don\u2019t wanna wind up in the gutter with a bottle of malt\nLiquor, bitter \u2018cause I never got a call\nTelling me that it\u2019s all figured out\nI\u2019m sick of doubt, but I\u2019m looking at the wall\nPart of me was hoping to be caught up in the moment\nAnd be open to the good and the God in me\nBut I got a lobotomy\nAnd I get that I oughta become a bit of an oddity\nWhen somebody gets offended by the thought of me\n\"Who\u2019s he?\" \u2026You gotta be kidding me!\nDo me like Gabourey Sidibe\nIf you see me with a chickadee\nNo diggity, it\u2019ll be giggity giggity giggity\nGonna send it like a letter from above\nWith a woman that I love, \u2018cause I get it like I live\nBut if my baby\u2019s gay, I\u2019ll say: \"You go, gay baby\nWork that crib! Work that bib! Burp that kid!\nScrew police! Flip that car!\"\nI don\u2019t want a Jesus piece\nBut I want a Reese\u2019s Piece and a Kit Kat Bar\nI want everybody focusing on getting me to Letterman\nTo kick it for the betterment\nOf innocent Americans who never want to settle\nFor their pop\u2026 or not, \u2018cause my bedroom rocks\nAnd the beat still knocks when I sort my socks\nI'm five-foot-eleven of sex\nFrom the tip of my head to my gorgeous... knees\n\n[Outro]\nWho is that boy? How does he rap so good?\nI don't know how that pale boy raps so good\nHow does he do that? Do that?\nMeow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d115f9afc68bd8acb901515a810e78b6.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": " Live! from the Troubadour", "title": "Pale Kid Raps Fast"}]}
