I do music.  And, I kind of do that, that, that outtake stuff, kind of like De La do.  And, and, I like Prince Paul stuff, and I know that you know him (ya, ya) so could you hook me up? So I can meet him, and uh, you know, be like an apprentice, of Prince Paul (ya).  And he said, \"yeah man, sure\".  So, 'cause he said I was kind of a happenin' guy, 'cause I look a little weird, I had delivered a baby and, and, and the mother didn't want it, she was trippin', she was like, \"ah nah\", she said she didn't know she was pregnant, she's full of shit though, she was all high on heroin. And she was like \"nah man, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I'm not going to the hospital, you take the baby, you go ahead, and I'ma stay here\". So we took the baby, like, I think it was my next door neighbor, and I was (ya, ya), five or six, this girl she said somethin', and I hit her with a wiffle ball bat. She said, what'd, what'd she say, she said \"we all gonna die anyway\".  Is that some shit or what? I ain't tryin' to fuck nobody who talkin' 'bout \"we all gonna die anyway\", so I ain't usin' no condom, 'cause I don't get no girls, I gets no ass.  It's fucked up when you don't get no ass.  Before I cum, one of my nuts, gets sucked up inside to my stomach. Is that, is that what, what, what kind of happens to you before you get a hernia or somethin' like that? They just think I'm a little, ah, stupid (ya, ya). Maybe a little, strange. But that's 'cause they don't no me", "year": "1996-06-25"}]}
