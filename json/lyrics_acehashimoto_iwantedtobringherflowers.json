I\u2019ll be your walkthrough\nIt won\u2019t change, I got you\nBut if it\u2019s not too late\nNot talkin\u2019 bout the time, I\u2019m talkin bout me n\u2019 you\nSo if it\u2019s not too late for us, there\u2019s something that I\u2019ve always wanted to do\n\n[Ending: Hook]\n\nI wanted to bring her flowers\nI wanted to bring her flowers to her job and we can watch the sunrise\nI wanted to bring her flowers\nI wanted to bring her flowers to her job and we can watch the sunrise\nSunrise", "year": "2012-07-17", "album": null}], "artist": "Ace Hashimoto"}
