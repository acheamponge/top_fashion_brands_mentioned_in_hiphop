And um, I remember, they wouldn't let you leave the hospital with us, until we had a name for you, and, we asked the, the doctor who delivered you, who actually delivered mama's youngest brother. I, I asked him, I said, well what's a name you haven't heard in a long time, because we, I remember we had a lot of discussion on what your name was going to be if you were a boy or a girl, and uh, he said well I haven't heard the name Jonah, for quite some time, because you were special, to us, so you were going to have a special name. So we said, we'll name, I said, well what if, we don't have a name, and he said well, were, well you can't leave the ba-, leave the hospital with a, with, with baby \"x\".
