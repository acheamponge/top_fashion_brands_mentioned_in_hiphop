{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1: Aesop Rock]\nI start my city with a brick (one brick)\nThen add another brick (two bricks)\nBrick by brick I manufacture homes for fallen angels\nI ain't no great Samaritan, that's just the way the game goes\nRespect the polars but acknowledge middle-value rainbows\nMy snout turned up from dream factory eyelids\nSlinging bottled prosperity for the kamikaze colonels\nYeah rocks the match that burned his Nazi journals\nAnd plotting verticals amidst blatantly horizontal\nModels then swallowed by famished potholes\nAnd I'm tired, tied up on these functions\nKiller cotton candy clouds and huckleberry justice league\nAnother knuckle dragger dungeon breed\nRun, breathe, sit, bellow\nWild Aes scream through your style to hear the echo\nAight then, flinch for the great granddaddy payback\nWhen Little Billy bought a tugboat\nNow he thinks he's Captain Ahab\nFascist, it takes more than peg legs, birds and eye patches\nLearn that lesson you'll be swashbuckling with the best of them\nWonder why you wept over spilled milk and got your crayons wet\nThe room reeks of a thousand bayonets\nI'll fission vision with a lie longer than your most walked meridian\nConnecting life with that little species of idiots\nWe've now officially scraped barrel bottom\nAesop Rock, an apple to the core but y'all ignored him\nI know a planet made of porcelain\nAnd once I get tired of holding this gavel up\nY'all prayer circles met him up born again\nI ain't too good for tap water\nPlay taps out of order for a ballad, corpse a dead man walking\nYou can lead a man to a city, but that don't assure civility\nYou can beat a man to death with Aesop Rock bootleg CD's (That's more fun anyway)\nSome cats float, some cats don't\nI speak in Fahrenheit and burn off coal and lyric\nDiss blatant harassment, spit honor, whistle fearless\nDon't dismiss the billy goat appearance for that common sheep\n\n[Aesop and Illogic overlapping each other]\n\n[Hook: Aesop Rock]\nPlatforms have been erected\nEffigies built\nSlogans coined, songs have been written\nRumors have been circulated\nAutographs faked\nThe hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape\nMoving boxes have been worn out\nMantelpieces dusted\nIdols idolized, the sands have been shifted\nCurtains have been closed\nSleepers all waked\nThe hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape\n\n[Hook: Illogic]\nNow with my trusty paperclip\nI pick locks of thoughts vault\nFinding the garden barren\nThe harvest fruitless\nOnly the tree of life flourishing\nWanting to take a bite but I'm toothless\nIs that predestination or is it by design?\nThat I'm trapped in time sand\nShow radio mission control but for my rhymes\nMan because I can like aluminium\nAnd I recycle my consciousness\nThis is just a note\nFor any action or lack thereof there's a consequence\n\n[Verse 2: Illogic]\nWingless angels\nStroll a top shapeless cotton balls\nWith halos in your syringe\nCelestial ground is found, broken\nExposing a bottomless depth where heartless spines awake to devour the small piece of your soul that's left\nYou're immersed in sound, floating\nAimless destination\nDrop anchor to gain stability\nStare out potions, restrain fertility\nPedestal talk is a token soaked in pockets where lives' topics lack conceptual, ridicule\nThe night breathes, but light's choking\nDarkness occupies the throne where poems are persecuted\nThe purity at time diluted\nRhymes are executed for genre, I'm told\nWhen has beens attempt to cause heat to rise and wonder why they're trapped in cold\nLife's an origami box and I'm hidden within the fold\nSo when the yarn unravels I won't be caught by surprise\nAnd as society's fabric of orthodoxies dismantle I'll see you embracing the pentagram within this crucifix disguise\nSee, when the canvas stands before me I'm compelled to spill a vision\nFor the sinners that listen: I got three spikes and a thorn crown\nIt seems I need a new soul because mine is worn down\nBut from the pregnancy of my hardship was born style\nStill my pen bleeds and stains the paper with thought\nFinding me lost among statues of mainstream idols\nDrowning in melted ice, to reinforce that breath is vital\nIf your father and his father were fish out of water you must break the cycle\nHow many times must a plant be uprooted, for it to die?\nWhen it's smothered with lies that abolish the potency of the sky\nSo when the stars burn out and God replaces the bulbs with a million watts\nAnd throws the switch, sparks filament\nHerding blue giants and flocks\nI stand on my own two, aura illuminated in red\nShowcasing the agony held within this welded spirit\nSacrificing itself for the health of a masochistic culture\nYearning for the truth that we speak, but refuse to hear it\n\n[Hook]", "title": "One Brick", "album": "Labor Days", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6a16cbbd76c264fec96a9675981e9556.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2001-09-18"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
