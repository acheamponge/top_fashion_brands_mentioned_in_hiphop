Who was lyin'?\nDid it play out the way you had it in your mind?\nI'm all alone and I gotta stay strong\nMothafuckas wanna see me outside\nI'm in the cut writin' songs, did you wrong\nBut I gotta get this shit out one time (one time)\nYou never know if these feelings last long\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI know I left some things in your apartment\nAnd you know you left some pictures on my camera roll\nThe things we gotta let go (I know nothing, babe)\nI try to stay true to my youth and my honor\nI try to be the man you told me you wanted to know\nBut fuck do I know? (I know nothing, babe)\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't be thinkin' 'bout no past chick\nThinkin' 'bout no past shit\nNo matter what they gon' say\nI can't be thinkin' 'bout no past chick\nThinkin' 'bout no past shit\nSometimes I wanna run away and go\nOoh, I'ma take my time\nHit decline, get my mind right\nOoh, no matter where I'm at\nWho I'm with, you'll be fine\n\n[Verse 2]\nBaby I'm sorry for being me too much\nAt the wrong time\nI know apologies mean nothing to you\nKeep doin' them back all over again\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI know I left some things in your apartment\nAnd you know you left some pictures on my camera roll\nThe things we gotta let go (I know nothing, babe)\nI try to stay true to my youth and my honor\nI try to be the man you told me you wanted to know\nBut fuck do I know? (I know nothing, babe)\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't be thinkin' 'bout no past chick\nThinkin' 'bout no past shit\nNo matter what they gon' say\nI can't be thinkin' 'bout no past chick\nThinkin' 'bout no past shit\nSometimes I wanna run away and go\nOoh, I'ma take my time\nHit decline, get my mind right\nOoh, no matter where I'm at\nWho I'm with, you'll be fine\n\n[Bridge]\nOh I don't wanna care, I can never choose\nYou left me right here, it wasn't only you\nOh you took care of me when I was out to lose\nI was self-obsessed, I didn't see the truth\nOh what you know about it, you know all about it\nI know what you know, baby\nAnd even though I'm sorry, I ain't gon' lie\nI'm never gonna change your way\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't be thinkin' 'bout no past chick\nThinkin' 'bout no past shit\nNo matter what they gon' say\nI can't be thinkin' 'bout no past chick\nThinkin' 'bout no past shit\nSometimes I wanna run away and go\nOoh, I'ma take my time\nHit decline, get my mind right\nOoh, no matter where I'm at\nWho I'm with, you'll be fine\n\n[Outro]\nHola Alejandro, soy yo. Te llamo para decirte que eres un idiota y que eres un est\u00fapido tan grande de haber enga\u00f1ado una mujer como yo. Ahora eres Alejandro, Alejandro, todas las aman todas te aman. \u00bfSabes que? No te aman como yo. Yo te am\u00e9 con todo mi coraz\u00f3n... con todo, todo mi cuerpo. \u00bfPero sabes que? Esta bi\u00e9n. Seas un est\u00fapido, idiota. Olv\u00eddate de m\u00ed..."}]}
