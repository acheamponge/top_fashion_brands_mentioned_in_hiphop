"[Intro: Future & Post Malone]\nOh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah\nYeah, you'd die for me\nSaid you'd die, said you'd die\nBut\u2005you\u2005lied, you lied\u2005to me\n\n[Chorus: Post Malone]\nSaid you'd take a bullet,\u2005told me you would die for me\nI had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me\nWe were on the low, but you were getting high with me\nWhen it's past 11, that's a different side I see\nSaid you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me\nBut you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me\nSaid you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me\nBut you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me\n\n[Verse 1: Post Malone]\nIt was love at first sight, felt like you were chosen (Oh)\nBut that blood in your veins, yeah, I know it's frozen (It's so cold)\nGot no patience no more (No)\nBeen waitin' too long (Yeah)\nYou hid that shit away and I was the last one to know, bitch (Ayy)\nI heard you comin' in, I was lyin' there awake\nDidn't know that it was you, got the gun right out the safe (Damn)\nRemember when you got my ass arrested (Wow)\nAt least when I was in jail, I got some rest in (Yeah)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]\nOoh, I surrender (Ayy), time to forget ya (Ayy)\nI'm too tired to forgive ya (Ayy), it's too hard on my liver (Ayy)\nAnd you know (Ayy) it\u2019s all (Ayy) over now\nAll your friends (Ayy), you know (Ayy) they sold you out\n\n[Chorus: Post Malone & Future]\nSaid you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me (Die for me)\nI had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me (Lying to me)\nWe were on the low, but you were getting high with me (High with me)\nWhen it's past 11, that's a different side I see (Side I see)\nSaid you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Die, die, die)\nBut you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (Lie, lie, lie)\nSaid you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Die, die, die)\nBut you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah (You lied, yeah)\n\n[Verse 2: Future]\nIt was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights\n9 AM, I came from out the club, it was daylight (Daylight)\nGot a bad girl, I was treating her too nice\u00a0(I was treating her too nice)\nCaught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need (That ain't what I need)\nYou just sold your soul, girl, quit crying (Sold your soul)\nYour passport, it looks like you lying (Know you cold)\nYou broken down by your past, don't deny it (You know I know)\nYour ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah (Flying)\nWasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was trying (I was trying on ya)\nI did everything to reach out to you (I was reaching out)\nSaid you never had me caught up in no\u00a0drama (No drama)\nI done ran into my karma (I done ran)\n\n[Chorus: Future]\nSaid you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me (That you would die)\nI had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me (You'd been lying)\nWe been on the low, but you been getting high with me (You was high)\nWhen it's past 11, that's a different side I see (A different side)\nSaid you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Said you'd die, you said you'd die)\nBut you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (Now you're lying)\nSaid you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)\nBut you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me\n\n[Verse 3: Halsey]\nSettle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough\nI came around, I figured out, should follow my gut\nI don't play anymore, I went through your phone\nAnd called the girls in your DMs and took all them home\nAnd I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me\nGrew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me\nTurns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows\nI sold 15 million copies of a break-up note\nBrought some strangers in our beds\nAnd now you lost your right to privacy\nSpilling all our secrets\nWhen you thought they'd probably die with me\nKnow you fucking love it on the low\nAnd you don't have to say I'm crazy\n'Cause I know nothing's changed though\n\n[Chorus: Post Malone & Halsey, Halsey]\nSaid you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me\n(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)\nI had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me\n(But you lied, you lied, you lied)\nWe were on the low, but you were getting high with me\n(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)\nWhen it's past 11, that's a different side I see\n(But you lied, you lied, you lied)\nSaid you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me\n(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)\nBut you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me\n(But you lied, you lied, you lied)\nSaid you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me\n(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)\nBut you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me\n(But you lied, you lied, you lied)", "year": "2019-09-06"}]}
