materialistic, fuck your opinion\nThe direction that I'm taking my lyrics is contradicting\nThe image of any rapper considered my opposition\nThat's forgetting about the feeling of lack of a pot to piss in\nThe window to throw it out of wasn't no where to be found\nI said I built it from the mother fucking ground\nFall in love with the sound\nIf you listen to my music inthe least\nRealize I'm a mother fucking beast\nGod Damn nigga\n\n[Chorus x3]\nI don't know what you've been told my nigga\nBuying into to all the shit that you've been sold my nigga\n\nI don't know what you've been told my nigga\nI don't know what you've been told\n\n[Verse 1]\nNigga you can call me Lucky Luciano pop a rotti in Maserati\nDucking paparazzi did a kamikazi\nWith a bitch that wanna party\nPop a Molly\nI'm fully aware that that wasn't even original\nBut I'm a smooth criminal\nThe message I provide is more subliminal\nAnd that was just a simple rhyme scheme\nYou could hear upon your radio\nA laundry list of reasons why I'll know they never play me though\nAnd yeah I got the dialect\nBut I refuse to give into the rhetoric\nIt's not competitive, it's a sedative in monopoly\nMonotony's the way they turn the music into anomalies\nGiving you garbage sonically and you chose to accept it\nYou know they forcing you shit like they feeding you diuretics\nPathetic\nI got aesthetics\nIn acquisition through etiquette\nElevated your mind with the elegance of my eloquence\nDelicate maybe definite, defecate on your confidence\nDesecrate in the paper, defiling the English language\nDistinguish and then extinguish, relinquish you of your powers\nExterminating your ignorance, I think they got Napoleon complexes with impotence\nInfinite possibilities limited by your fallacies\nMasterminded the manifestation of my reality\nIn all actuality the content of my music is subject to your perception\nI'll make a lasting impression like lashes upon the spots of my ancestor or heritage\nI feel the way I follow these trenches fucking embarrassing\nBarricaded my mind cause I don't want let the devil in\nHallucinated off of LSD and therefore masculine\nMedicating my mental capabilities mutilated my will\nI live ya life like is it even really real, I bought a dollar bill\nAn automatic weapon that a nigga would conceal\nAim it at a target pull the trigger till the blood has start to spill\nYour cup runeth over till that motherfucker drip upon the page\nA revelations of reservations eliminated by my preparation and\nLyrical fornication which formulated personification of the imagination\nAnd elaborate type of labyrinth slapping rapidly, lacking the single lies of human decency\nFrequent injections of methamphetamines, metaphorically\nMetamorphing into the perfect moment when my soul has been reborn\nAnd only God knows that I will never conform Lord\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI lock myself inside of a room as I try to create a masterpiece\nMathematical madness precision down to the decimal\nTake it to higher levels, I'm moving it up a decibel\nIf you're susceptible to professional fundamentals that capture your fascination\nYou create an interpretation or taking the broader stroke and make a classification\nCompletely eradicating artistic sophistication aristocratic vocation\nExhilarating elation I chose it for navigation to make a path of my own\nSurpassing the aggravation perpetrated allegation my passion and dedication\nIs penetrating your politics and if it's honest\nYou'll never have an internal conflict\nTry to convince the world and then place yourself in that image\nWhere artists imitation reflecting illuminated\nThe truth will come to the light that your alternate form of flattery\nWas just another extension of your demented fantasy\nVandalize with profanity too confused for humanity candidly I'm conducting the sickening type of cynical\nSacrilegious and criminal plan that couldn't be broken was spoken\nIt's not divisible minimal or remissible in any court of public opinion\nSo fuck your feminine feelings from this moment within the present to infinity\nRecipe for divinity written within this imagery symmetry of my energy\nSynergy of the sinister penning the proper living convinced the post [?] re-visuals\nI viciously victimize while I victim you leaving you destitute without a restitution or a resolution\nFor your convolution of my revolution and the best solution\nSolidifying constant confusion or current illusion that are eluding that your inclusion\nInfusing the few formalities fanatics suffocate upon formaldehyde from publication came with degradation\nAnd a sunny deposition the audacity that ever supposition when you listen\nI'm fixing to be the greatest lyricist that sees a living if given the opportunity\nBut usually if usury infested jewelry is not confusing me\nNever consuming me as I attempt to be more proficient prolific like predecessors that elevated\nWhen the purpose wasn't permeated doing supplication\nSuccess is impossible without plans of premeditation"}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
