I can barely slug a half a dozen tops\nUsed to chug a lot, now I'm fuckin buzzin off a shot whoa\n\nClubbin wasn't nuffin to me boy\nUsed to walk up in that muthafucka stuntin like whassup, I wadn't coy\nAin't nobody gave a fuck if I'm employed\n\nErrybody drunk and fuckin lovin it, rubbin, and huggin\nMugging, chugging and fuckin but now these bitches\nIs up on some other shit, wanting a husband\nClubbin got me buggin and blushing cuz I'ma young'n das confronted\nWit a hundred abundantly rugged, and coveted, funded muthafuckas, it's humbling\n\nThink about the age range\nThey get to date way older and emotionally open homies goin gray\nNow I'm up on first dates\nSober like it's first grade\nHoping when it's over that I close it wit some first base shit\n\nMa face getting fuckin fat\nIt's April, hateful fillin fuckin taxes out\n\nLong ass days, getting blazed, and tappin out\nBack is naggin now, mac is laggin now\n\nBecause I bought it back in college\nSo if you comin lemme run a little knowledge\nIf you was wondering if fun isn't acknowledged\nWell Wednesdays, I be watching workaholics"}], "artist": "Lil Dicky"}
