The dead man will\nWalk it out, moon walk, and side step\nGlide up and step into the keeper\u2019s crypt\nYou kept knockin\u2019 on my grave until I finally came out\nRose up above you and snuffed your flame out\nThe clock on my neck tells backwards time\nAnd that Ouija board ain\u2019t no ho, you\u2019ll find\nI know of demons that will come through and won\u2019t go back\nThey\u2019ll pull your hair out your head. It won\u2019t grow back\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI be the dead man walkin\u2019.
