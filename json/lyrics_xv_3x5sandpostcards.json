Alone? Haha)\n\nOpen the door, let's explore, not the world but the coolniverse\nWith all the pretty girls that I'll never get to meet\nShe said \"I'll keep your room the same\"\nI said that I'll never change\nThen I packed up all my things\nNow I'm headed out to sea\n\n[Hook]\nSo get used to\n3 by 5's and postcards\n3 by 5's and postcards\n3 by 5's and postcards\nBecause I'm going away\n\nSo get used to\n3 by 5's and postcards\n3 by 5's and postcards\n3 by 5's and postcards\nI think I'll send one today\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow I'm flying through the space vapors on a plane made of paper\nMama said my imagination would get me far\nSo dealing with the inner circle of haters\nI took a nap on the el-el-elevator and now I'm heading towards the stars\n\nI never ever imagined that all of this would have happened\nWith me rapping so I'm sorry for being gone for so long\nI thought that all the bullshit would just stop\nIf my music would just pop\nAnd I make it to the top\nWell I guess I was wrong\n\n[Hook x2]"}], "artist": "XV"}
