What happened to your hand?\"\n\"Just another accident cutting vegetables I guess.\"\nEverything's a trap these days we're all working to prevent\nNo one ever thinks of escape, just take the hit and bang out the dents\nYou don't know why he's standing here or how he got this far\nUp the beach and out of reach of running rusted car\nThe waves are louder than a train crashing down upon his chest\nHe can't be dragged down like the rest and wait patient just for his death\nTaking off his hat he steps and brushes her hair away\nKisses her cheek gently and asks her for her name\nShe bows her head and smiles a bit and takes a shaky hand\nHe has no idea just what she said with the waves crashing in his head\n\n\"Pardon me miss, could you blow me a kiss?\nLast night a couple of lovers tossed each other off this bridge\nI think I better just call it all quits\nI used to run this town but it just ain't the same place that it ever was.\"\n\n\"Pardon me miss, could you blow me a kiss?\nLast night a couple of lovers tossed each other off this bridge\nI think I better just call it all quits\nI used to run this town but it just ain't the same place that it ever was.\"", "year": "2006-05-23"}]}
