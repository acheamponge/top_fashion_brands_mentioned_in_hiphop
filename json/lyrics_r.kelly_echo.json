Kelly]\nThe way you riding it I can tell you like my surprise\nSex in the evening, sex all night\nNow I'm working it up n down like a roller coaster ride\nSex in the evening, sex all night\nI got your eyes rolling back finger nails in your spine\nSex in the evening, sex all night\nWe never had a sex session like this one in your life\nSex in the evening, sex all night\nNow when we finally get to round ten\nWe not gon stop we'll start again\nAnd when you need a break I'll let you up\nI'll let you breathe, wash your face, get something to eat\nThen come back to the bedroom\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I'll be waiting for you right there baby\nI'll be waiting there to fuck like crazy\nI hope your ready to go all day long\nI hope your ready girl to scream and moan\nLike oley oley ooo\nWanna hear you echo, echo oley oley ohhoooo\nWanna hear you echo, echo\n\n[Bridge]\nEven though were in this room just you and me\nI got you sounding like your screaming from a mountain peak\nAnd you don't wanna come down and I dont want you to come down\nSo girl lets keep coming and we gon go to heaven from this room\nAnd the gates will open up when they see it's me and you\nOoh so unlock the door, come back in girl I got my second wind\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Echo", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5a944a10bb0940f7591a3793da77ca12.550x550x1.jpg"}]}
