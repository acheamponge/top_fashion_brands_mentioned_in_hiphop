ain't got no fingers left for my bags\nEverytime I get dressed, I'm popping one or more tags\nBought me a rover truck 'cause I don't want no Jag\nKeepin' a 40 tucked, 30 rounds in the mag\nYeah, my stomach hurt 'cause I been rollin' all week\nAnd I've been up for 3 days and I forgot to eat\nDoin' donuts in my V, throwin' up in my suite\nEvery bitch say I'm sweet, but every bitch know I cheat\nCar and I'm payin' the note, breathe air less than I smoke\nCan't swallow, my diamonds choke, narcotics inside my coat\nThousand bitches inside my phone, pay for everything that I own\nThese rappers sound like my clones, but they ain't take me off my throne\n\n[Chorus: NAV & Belly]\nLook at me, momma, your son turned into a star (to a star)\nJump in my spaceship and I'm takin' off to Mars (skrrt, skrrt)\nMy diamonds shine in the night like the moon (bling, bling)\nStay far away from these weirdos like I'm Neptune (yeah)\nLook at me, momma, your son turned into a star (to a star)\nJump in my spaceship and I'm takin' off to Mars (skrrt, skrrt, yeah)\nMy diamonds shine in the night like the moon (bling, bling, yeah)\nStay far away from these weirdos like I'm Neptune (yeah, look)\n\n[Verse 2: Belly]\nDrippin', drippin' on 'em, Super Soaker (Super Soaker)\nOoh, I'm lit now, supernova (supernova)\nYeah, I changed, I used to sleep inside the sofa (sofa)\nAlways high, bitch, I ain't never ever sober (you know I'm not)\nI don't gotta look up now, stars alignin' (oh, yeah)\nMe and NAV bought matchin' Rolexes, that's perfect timin' (oh, yeah)\nI got that dope, no consignment (no consignment)\nCatch a fuckin' chest cold from all these diamonds\nBut you know I'm on fire, fire, fire (fire)\nI don't ever tell a lie, lie, lie (woo)\nBut I can see it in your eye, eye, eye (see it)\nI know you wish that you could ride, ride, ride (skrrt)\nYeah\n\n[Chorus: NAV]\nLook at me, momma, your son turned into a star (to a star)\nJump in my spaceship and I'm takin' off to Mars (skrrt, skrrt)\nMy diamonds shine in the night like the moon (bling, bling)\nStay far away from these weirdos like I'm Neptune (yeah)\nLook at me, momma, your son turned into a star (to a star)\nJump in my spaceship and I'm takin' off to Mars (skrrt, skrrt)\nMy diamonds shine in the night like the moon (bling, bling)\nStay far away from these weirdos like I'm Neptune (yeah)\n\n[Verse 3: Derek Wise]\nDriver pullin' up, I fill his trunk up with my bag (skrrt, skrrt)\nNext, they do the same thing like a stripper's sugar dad (yeah)\nFirst, I bought the Bimmer, but I'd rather the G-Wag (yeah)\n19 years of age, was livin' better than my dad (fuck it)\nSwitchin' up, all my old friends barely know me (barely know me)\nFake niggas 'round my niggas, couldn't fool me (couldn't fool me)\nCash just called my phone, said cut the loosie (prrr)\nNiggas got they motives, fade like Boosie (yeah)\nDoin' the dirt on my own, can't track my traphouse (trap, trap)\nNickel and dime for my youngins, I'm movin' the pack now\nVLONE all over my jeans, can't rock no Levi (nah)\nDon't keep no receipts, I BMF on these sides (BMF, yeah)\n30k for a show, that's just a bracelet\nMy new bitch just got karats for her lasik\nMoney crypto current, couldn't trace it\nGot some people that entitled, never make shit (never make shit)\n\n[Chorus: NAV]\nLook at me, momma, your son turned into a star (to a star)\nJump in my spaceship and I'm takin' off to Mars (skrrt, skrrt)\nMy diamonds shine in the night like the moon (bling, bling)\nStay far away from these weirdos like I'm Neptune (yeah)\nLook at me, momma, your son turned into a star (to a star)\nJump in my spaceship and I'm takin' off to Mars (skrrt, skrrt)\nMy diamonds shine in the night like the moon (bling, bling)\nStay far away from these weirdos like I'm Neptune (yeah)\n\n[Verse 4: 88 Camino]\nHow you let a lame fuck for free?\nWhen's the last, you can't even see what's up with me (me)\nOff the acid drop, you know what's up with me (me)\nGot a name from the game, it wasn't cheap\nPockets so fat, I used to stash it inside of that gas tank\nGoyard bag, fill it with cash, givin' me back pain (skrrt, skrrt)\nGroupies on call, wanna be all part of my campaign (campain)\nBitches, they all changed up soon as those racks came\nVampire drip like Dracula (Dracula)\nSaint Laurent on my clothes (Dracula)\nMy life is spectacular ('tacular)\nMy bitches doin' the most (doin' the most)\nThrow ones, watch 'em rack it up (rack it up)\nDollar bills stuck to her toes (stuck to her toes)\nHit, I make it look easy (easy), the triple double in the post (easy)\n\n[Chorus: NAV]\nLook at me, momma, your son turned into a star (to a star)\nJump in my spaceship and I'm takin' off to Mars (skrrt, skrrt)\nMy diamonds shine in the night like the moon (bling, bling)\nStay far away from these weirdos like I'm Neptune (yeah)\nLook at me, momma, your son turned into a star (to a star)\nJump in my spaceship and I'm takin' off to Mars (skrrt, skrrt)\nMy diamonds shine in the night like the moon (bling, bling)\nStay far away from these weirdos like I'm Neptune (yeah)"}], "artist": "NAV"}
