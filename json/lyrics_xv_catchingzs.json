Y'all sound asleep\nYou bore me in your verses, I'm sleeping on a beat\nI'm snoring on the chorus like I'm awaiting a T\nYou couldn't get a buzz if I made you a beat\nCouldn't come after X if I made you a Z\nHiphopDX said Complex was weak\nAnd I got my game that very same week\nVolume 2 dropped that very same month\nAnd I closed the mouths of those very same punks\nRappers ain't snacks they everyday lunch\nEven though they biting I tell 'em they suck\nTry to bring me down and I tell you what's up\nDrag me on the ground like Snuffleupagus trunk\nPick 'em up, let that man shine\nCause I'm the bomb like a lawn full of land mines\nYou know what time it is? That's a damn lie\n(Why?)\nCause I travel on Japan time\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "XV"}
