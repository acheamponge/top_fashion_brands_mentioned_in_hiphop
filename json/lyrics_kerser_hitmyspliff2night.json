They say I gotta thirsty mind\nI gotta slow down reason for the purple sprite\nAny style, it's been proven I kill\nYour bitch want to do to me what I do to a pill, I'm ill\nPlus only fans see where the fuck I'm coming from\nMoving units, major labels, thinking something's wrong\nYes yes, it is true, I get hated, but I get paid a lot\nJust must mean I made it gronk, the raw rap that can split 'em in half\nIf music was a slut, I got my fucking dick in her arse\nPlus I'm hitting it fast, no hands in the driver seat\nNo breaks, pop pills as I'm lighting the weed\nFresh shirt rockin' with the hat to match\nI'm getting head racking lines in a taxi cab, and that's a wrap\n\n[Hook: Kerser]\nLet me hit my spliff tonight\nEyes half closed red, screaming this the life\nStand out from the pack with a different mind\nServing up the rap, you can get in line\nLet me hit my spliff tonight\nEyes half closed red, screaming this the life\nStand out from the pack with a different mind\nServing up the rap, you can get in line\n\n[Verse 2: Jay UF]\nLet me hit my spliff tonight\nThen hit the mic and bring on back a different kind of fucking shit you like\nThe next in line to progress, mess your frickin' mind\nYes, you guessed it right, I'm next to climb while I spit the freshest I've\nEver spat before, sure you can try ignore the signs\nBut truth be told I'm walking right towards a life I ought to find\nI slaughter rhymes whenever aiming at my target\n'Cause I'm sort of like a sword when I can't wait to rip apart shit\nHated by so many fools, they listen and they like me\nTurnin' crazy like some cannibals just wishin' they could bite me\nBut uh-uh, I made a flow and they should know the go now\nThis ain't a race, but way too late for me to fucking slow down\nI came to make the best and take my fate and I ain't giving up\nIt's Jay UF, and, yes, I changed my name and I don't give a fuck\nIt's all the same, same face, abnormal brain. It's simple bruz\nThe only Jay you today with Ratesy and the sickest cunt\n\n[Hook: Kerser]\nLet me hit my spliff tonight\nEyes half closed red, screaming this the life\nStand out from the pack with a different mind\nServing up the rap, you can get in line\nLet me hit my spliff tonight\nEyes half closed red, screaming this the life\nStand out from the pack with a different mind\nServing up the rap, you can get in line\n\n[Verse 3: Kerser]\nEnemies appear 'cause I'm sitting at the top spot\nPeople everywhere are thinking why I haven't got shot\nI'm making music if I'm not on the road then\nI chase the dream I'm making sure that it won't end\nAt a mate's place off my face\nTalking bout the days, thinking how a lot has changed\nBut I gotta keep moving 'cause you only get one shot\nFingers in the air, tell 'em all they can fuck off\nCrazy world, Imma paint the picture perfect\nWords so explicit that I burn your eye's surface\nIt's so easy, smash 'em all 'cause they lame kid\nWe stand out 'cause everybody do the same shit\nSo real in a scene that's fake\nTake away can't rest no sleep today\nI am the truth in a dream and they telling me it's real life\nI made my world change, I can't explain what that feels like\n\n[Hook: Kerser]\nLet me hit my spliff tonight\nEyes half closed red, screaming this the life\nStand out from the pack with a different mind\nServing up the rap, you can get in line\nLet me hit my spliff tonight\nEyes half closed red, screaming this the life\nStand out from the pack with a different mind\nServing up the rap, you can get in line"}], "artist": "Kerser"}
