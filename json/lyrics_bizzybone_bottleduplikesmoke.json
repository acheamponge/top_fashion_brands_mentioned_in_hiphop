C'mon\n\n[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]\nSo she wants to make me pay\nI am expected to lead the way\nBaby, I'm on the case\nRespect me and clean my slate\nSave face and watch what you say\nYou the thing like I watched you play\nCovered it up like smoke\nNow that I'm back, you can get all your dough\n\n[Chorus: Jonny Craig]\nDo the words still haunt you?\nCan you secure its claim?\nBottled up like smoke floating over flames\n\n[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]\nBabe, so you expect me to endure your pain?\nI can\u2019t wait to, oh, forgive me, okay\nI'm gon' bottle it up like smoke\nCan you endure this flame?\n\n[Hook: Bizzy Bone]\nSay, \"I have no conscience, I'm all about game\"\nAnd I say, \"That\u2019s shallow, and you won't change\"\nAnd those words hurt me in the exchange\nSo I splurge and send my tears away\n\n[Chorus: Jonny Craig]\nDo the words still haunt you?\nCan you secure its claim?\nBottled up like smoke floating over flames\nDo the words still haunt you?\nCan you secure its claim?\nBottled up like smoke floating over flames\n\n[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]\nYou talk about the women that I'm running with\nAnd why you even care about the women that I'm running with?\nThe funny thing is I can\u2019t remember\nWhen you was the only woman that was running it\nComing here and talking that gutter shit\nThe money was good then it was good with the covenant\nThe money got low and you rolled for the what of it\nThe better you test when I'm broke with no lovin'\nAnd I'm floating over the flames and maintain my thuggishness\nReady for the world, steady my palms and pearl\nAnd the pearl of the man from sayin it's my girl\nTwirl the baton my God cause I twerk\nGonna get it gotta get it and thats when I hurl\nThe word that I'll honor forever is that I love the bitch\nExcuse me, let me dig it on that dime down and say excuse miss\nExcuse me, let me dig it on that dime down and say excuse miss\n\n[Chorus: Jonny Craig]\nDo the words still haunt you?\nCan you secure its claim?\nBottled up like smoke floating over flames\n\n[Hook: Bizzy Bone]\nSay \"I have no conscience, I'm all about game\"\nAnd I say \"Thats shallow, and you won\u2019t change\"\nAnd those words hurt me in the exchange\nSo I splurge and send my tears away\n\n[Chorus: Jonny Craig]\nDo the words still haunt you?\nCan you secure its claim?\nBottled up like smoke floating over flames\nDo the words still haunt you?\nCan you secure its claim?\nBottled up like smoke floating over flames"}], "artist": "Bizzy Bone"}
