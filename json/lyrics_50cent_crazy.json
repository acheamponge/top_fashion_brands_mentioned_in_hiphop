Top of the world!\nI'm going crazy\nI'm going out of my head\n\n[Chorus: PnB Rock]\nIt feels like I'm going crazy\nNothing can save me\nI'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey\nI can't stop staring out my window\nChoppa and my pistol\nI'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nI'm exhausted, last night I lost it\nLet the homies get loose, I'm sure I'ma get the lawsuit\nNana called, my granddaddy coughing up blood\nGot an infection, the cycle of life just sucks\nI bet when he die, she die, just because\nThey been together 60 years, that's what they call love\nPaid for my first cousin wedding, over 200 grand\nThen two kids and six years later, he's the wrong man\nI woke up this morning, really wasn't feeling myself\nThought about suicide but me, I ain't killing myself\nMy cousin Dory shot his girlfriend then shot himself in the head\nBefore I shoot myself, I'm shooting everyone else kid\nMy head aching, my hands shaking, I'm sweating bullets\nAnd it ain't even hot in this bitch, I'm going through it\nMy mind playing tricks on me, I mean, shit homie\nI might need a straitjacket fit for me\n\n[Chorus: PnB Rock]\nIt feels like I'm going crazy\nNothing can save me\nI'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey\nI can't stop staring out my window\nChoppa and my pistol\nI'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nMy favorite uncle Roc got twisted 'til that liquor gave him sugar\nHad complications once or twice, that shit fucked up his liver\nTo me he\u2019s still the man cause see me I still remember\nThat lil\u2019 snorkel he bought me to stay warm that December\nI was sleeping in the basement, the window had a draft\nEven with the electric heater, I was freezing my ass\nI got some money now so if I die before him, I'ma leave it to him\nHe can have a fine nurse put that insulin needle to him\nCalled my son twice, he ain't picking up the phone\nAnd Banks, me and him don't even talk no more\nYou know cause of me, he ain't never have to sell crack\nNever used no knife or had to squeeze no strap\nBut if I go tonight, I bet you I'm hellbound\nFor cocaine distribution and letting off MAC rounds\nHome invasion robberies, we ran in that crack house\nTook them niggas paper and all of they packs out\n\n[Chorus: PnB Rock]\nIt feels like I'm going crazy\nNothing can save me\nI'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey\nI can't stop staring out my window\nChoppa and my pistol\nI'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nThen I was in the second row the second time Em married Kim\nLooking at Proof like, \"How much you think this gon' cost them?\"\nFeels like a set up, Shaniqua's being nice to me\nI rather a nigga just put a knife in me\nThan go through the emotions, the confusion and commotions\nNever die down in my head, they keep going\nIt feels like I'm God's punching bag on occasions\nAmazing, on other days, I feel like I'm His favorite\nI never bite my tongue, I just call a spade a spade\nWhen life feeding me lemons, I just make lemonade\nMy nana beat cancer, it came back for a rematch\nLife without my old girl, I couldn't see that\nMy grandpa was the strongest, then he broke down and I broke down\nI looked around like if shit go bad now, who I'ma gon' go to now?\nThat was his partner, see he knew everything about her\nNow he's saying he don't wanna live without her\n\n[Chorus: PnB Rock]\nIt feels like I'm going crazy\nNothing can save me\nI'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey\nI can't stop staring out my window\nChoppa and my pistol\nI'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head", "year": null}]}
