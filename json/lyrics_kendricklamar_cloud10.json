I know\nSelfish as I wanna be and every time you under me\nI get the vibe you might need some time to grow\n\n[Hook]\nWhen the sun fall out the sky\nAll I have is me in the land of do or die\nA freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind\nNow, that's the ultimate high\nTo the cloud I go, cloud I go\nOne time, baby tell me ya need me\nCloud I go, cloud I go\nTwo time, baby tell me ya love me\n\n[Verse 2]\nCause I been drinking too much, thinking too much\nWe ain't been keeping in touch\nAnd every time that I think of your touch\nAdrenaline pump, give me that rush\nI'm going like a thief inside the wind\nLord forgive me for my sins\nI know she want me more, but I fiend for benjamins\nShe said I found the root of all evil\nAnd lost a friend\nLost in the world of a young boy from Compton\nThat never knew love because love was never promised\nI know.. selfish as I wanna be\nAnd every time I'm under you, me too\nNeed time to grow..\n\n[Hook]\nWhen the sun fall out the sky\nAll I have is me in the land of do or die\nA freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind\nNow, that's the ultimate high\nTo the cloud I go, cloud I go\nOne time, baby tell me ya need me\nCloud I go, cloud I go\nTwo time, baby tell me ya love me"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
