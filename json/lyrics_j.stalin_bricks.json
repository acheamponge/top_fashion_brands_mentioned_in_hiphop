Stalin]\nPulled up to the spot\nWalked up in the trap\nUp in my drawls was two bricks of crack\nBricks of crack\nBricks of crack\nThem West Oakland niggas movin' bricks of crack\nPulled up to the spot\nWalked up in the trap\nUp in my drawls was two bricks of crack\nBricks of crack\nBricks of crack\nThem East Oakland niggas movin' bricks of crack\n\n[Verse 1: J. Stalin]\nThe zips are off, whip it 'til it's hardcore\nFive in the morning, dopies knockin' at the front door\nI'm on the block, cause I got no where else to go\nBelieve I ain't leavin' 'til my bundle gone\nI'mma hold this shit down 'til Lil Twin come home\nThey throwin' me out bricks\nI'm frontin' my nigga zips\nWhat's that fuckin' out your shirt\nThat's a thirty stick, I used to hit licks\nBut now I grind for it all\nIn the kitchen I'm a chemist\nI just whip me up 'em all\nI bought myself so more dope and my bitch a new car\nBoy, I'm charged up, still fuckin' with the plug\nGot that double-up, if you lookin' for the drugs\nNiggas talkin' shit, then you know we droppin' slugs\nIf it's ten niggas with me, twenty bangers in the club\nBut we gettin' this money\nSo nigga, fuck the club\nBut we gettin' this money\nSo nigga, fuck the club\n\n[Hook: J. Stalin]\nPulled up to the spot\nWalked up in the trap\nUp in my drawls was two bricks of crack\nBricks of crack\nBricks of crack\nThem West Oakland niggas movin' bricks of crack\nPulled up to the spot\nWalked up in the trap\nUp in my drawls was two bricks of crack\nBricks of crack\nBricks of crack\nThem North Oakland niggas movin' bricks of crack\n\n[Verse 2: J. Stalin]\nCause the boys in the hood are always hard\nCome talkin' that shit and they'll pull your card\nSlide on you niggas in my foreign car\nBut right now, bitch, I'm finna' drop the price on the hard\nI be posted up, on the block with the boy\nWhen it's Christmas time, I bought me a brand new toy\nOn the front line, nigga, like I just got deployed\nLearned to shoot first, nigga, kill and destroy\nWe got new whips, we done chromed out the feet\nGot the stash spot, like my name Big Meech\nSpent ten bands on my fuckin' neck piece\nI'm a real nigga, that's why the bitch want me\nAnd you gon' hold this banger when you ridin' with me\nDon't be a stranger to this danger cause I'm movin' this D\nAnd you gon' hold this banger when you ridin' with me\nAnd don't be a stranger to this danger cause I'm movin' this D\n\n\n[Hook: J. Stalin]\nPulled up to the spot\nWalked up in the trap\nUp in my drawls was two bricks of crack\nBricks of crack\nBricks of crack\nThem West Oakland niggas movin' bricks of crack\nPulled up to the spot\nWalked up in the trap\nUp in my drawls was two bricks of crack\nBricks of crack\nBricks of crack\nThem East Oakland niggas movin' bricks of crack"}], "artist": "J.
