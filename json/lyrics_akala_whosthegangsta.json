The real Gansta\n\n[Verse 1:Akala]\nI don\u2019t give a rats arse\nOr a raasclaat\nWho you're spars are\nOr where you par par\nDon\u2019t start\nAre your bars hard?\nHave you mastered\nHow to spar with a bastard?\nBeen dark since the march of the Spartans\nBefore Eve ate the fruit of the garden\nI was in pursuit of the truth like a slalom\nDodging these sergeants\nSlave masters\nWhether they cuffed or they feathered and tarred \u2018em\nSame shit\nDifferent Jargon\nSame Clip\nDifferent cartridge\nSame whip\nDifferent master\nLook closer\nWe ain't got past it\nThe shackles are not tackled\nThey\u2019re just different\nCattle rattle and rattle\nBut they collect the dividends\nWe're a fuel for someone else\u2019s engine\nWe don\u2019t run a damn thing We\u2019re just pretending\nSo all the big talk, don\u2019t affect me\nMy elders lick banks So you can\u2019t impress me\nWith all the talk \u2018bout another mans gun\nThat we use to kill each other for fun\nWhen the master sends the overseers to see us\nWe toss the weapon and run\nBoy dem run in your yard diss your mother\nDashing her knickers all out of the cupboard\nGot us face down with their feet on our neck\nBut we still believe we are vets\n\nChorus (x2)\nBut...do we make the straps and the scales\nOr just pack the jails\nSo please ask yourself\nWHO\u2019S THE GANGSTA?\nDo we make the planes and the boats\nThat import the coke?\nSo please ask yourself\nWHO\u2019S THE GANSTA?\n\n[Verse 2:Akala]\nWe blow each other\u2019s brain in\nSo entertaining\nThey drop bombs of depleted Uranium\nYou bruk the law?\nYou go to prison\nThey kill a couple million, stack a billion\nBusiness as usual, death in the colonies\nWhat is that but state to state armed robbery\nJust a road move on a bigger level\nThink we are mountains but we're just pebbles\nBetter yet a sand grain\nGo pop a little champagne\nBut the people in the south of France are not our fans mate\nWould love to live nice and happy too\nBut ask yourself this\nDoes anyone that you know control the flow of capital?\nThe answer is no\nAnd if you knew the business deals man are negotiating\nYou would know you could never ever claim that im hatin\nVegan cuz, but I get the bacon and eggs just fine\nIn case you\u2019re mistaken\nAnd if I don\u2019t like that?\nI don\u2019t like that\nGrew up on Big Yout and Gregory Isaacs\nNo surprise that\nRevolution on my track\nBeen right there from right back\nSacred Geometry\nDon\u2019t follow me\nStill just an angry yout that spits horribly\nTrying to live peaceful, I remember\nWhat happened the last time I lost my temper\nAnd believe I ain't trying to be hard\nThe abuse that I suffered\nI\u2019m emotionally scarred\nSupposed to be only beholding the bars\nInstead I\u2019m a professor that never went to class\nI write literature, they write bars\nThe Celtic warrior, Marooned from yard\nWhen you compare me to these little tarts\nAll you are showing is you\u2019re not very smart\nReal MC it\u2019s my culture\nGrew up on the sound systems with the toasters\nYou man\u2019a put down\nIts third gear to me\nTenth planet ain't not another one near to me\nWhen I orbit\nClicks forfeit\n\u2018course it flows\nMy yout don\u2019t force it\nOr try brush man off\nAs just conscious\nCome out my face with that nonsense\nTug revolution, that\u2019s what it is\nNever do we run from one of these kids\nIf we ain't shook with the owners of the plantation\nWhy would we run from a slave?\nWe\u2019ve all got goons\nThat love us enough to wanna die for us\nSo just behave\nCause man\u2019a old school straighteners\nOne two one two face of the haters\nChasing their papers\nNah!\nMan are chasing freedom\nBut papers are making and blatantly shaking and quaking in their boots\nAnytime you talk about breaking enslavement\nSo I do feel like Neo in the Matrix\nCause I don\u2019t understand\nWhy is everybody so scared of the agents\nWhen they are powerless BLATANT\nGot a little bit, but I put it on the line\nListen to the shit that I spit in my rhymes\nAli at his prime, principal first\nEven if it means that I don\u2019t get heard\nCause the herds are absurd\nTheir hating the nerd\nBut the nerd's controlling the face of the earth\nSo I tell a man so straight I\u2019m a nerd\nBut duppy a track at my worst\nCold as a blizzard in a furnace\nA wizard of a wordsmith\nRiddles that I chisel in stone\nPerfect\nAsk for yourself on the road\nThey\u2019ll tell you Akala is cold\nHe kicks knowledge for the block\nNever gonna stop\nProgression on my albums\nNever gonna flop\nWhen that shit\u2019s on\nIt starts to dawn\nThis whole shit is chess\nAnd they want us to celebrate the fact that we are just pawns\nBut I am not on it\nSee\nThe last thing they want is man with road energy\nTo stop killing one another and think cleverly\nAnd ask why you\u2019re living where you\u2019re living and how you\u2019re living\nDid you create the conditions that you\u2019re raising you\u2019re kid in?\nAnd if you didn\u2019t who did it?\nIs it really for the hood\nIf our oppressors like our lyrics\nIf only by crushing your aspirations\nCan they maintain this here situation\nOnly by destroying the dreams of your kids quick\nCan they keep their unearned privileges\nAnd that is what it\u2019s all about", "year": "2012-05-28", "album": "Knowledge Is
