sphinxes, pyramids\nRaise them high in the name of different kings\nThe different things we've held sacred, divine\nThrough places and times\nThe range of supplications and rites\nThrough ages we find\nNations arise\nAs old civilizations crumble to dust\nBecoming strangers in time, waiting to die\nReplaced in the night\nThe day breaks and the light changes\nIlluminating newer human faces as fights rage\nThe human race is facing the might\nOf righteous states who would write\nThe history books even if it took a knife's blade\nTo find the right page\nSengoku Jidai\nMen offered to die\nFor the honor of a warrior's life\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe sun's coming and we're watching it rise\nAs a new era's here, it's as solid as iron\nPull the tongs from the fire\nStrike the hammer to the anvil\nCraft a weapon to bring an enemy to a standstill\nThe blacksmith is the wizard that gives us\nThese powers - devour enemies\nLeaping down from the siege towers\nThe better the tech is\nThe lesser the effort to wreck it\nThe less time to see their eyes\nAnd feel sympathetic\nNever regret it\nA true knight never stays a true blade\nNever says touch\u00e9\nBut would forever lay in blue rays of weathered glades\nTo demonstrate his never-ending dedication\nTo the crusade\nReformation through flame\nAnd after the cremation is a new age\nTime's quill is quick to spill its ink onto a new page\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe faces are the same as when in days gone\nBut brains are cultivated thus creating\nThe Renaissance\nWe're still using steel tools to stay strong\nReplacing blades with greater trades\nPen and paper, song\nFaith in God is tested, hiding in the desert\nMen excited, then enlightened by the scientific method\nTried describing its expression\nBy inscribing his impression\nWhen applying it to heavenly bodies\nThat everybody reckoned\nMust have been made by a creator or a greater force\nNature's author faced examination never faced before\nThe grace of horse and rider\nReplaced by wars and violence\nDebased the laws of science\nMade the case for all the pious\nWhy is it progress always leads to loads of mess\nThe western region spread across the globe and coalesced\nSettlers spread disease with effortless ease\nWas it reckless or did it just happen inevitably?\nWhile evidently we never can see\nThrough the lens of this century\nBut there's no retreating now\nWhether or not it was meant to be\n\n[Verse 4]\nThe seven seas were sailed\nNavies prevailed\nLeaving trails of devastation in their wake\nAs people wailed\nA world of wonder plundered traded in the name of progress\nBut human nature's way shows we should expect no less\nOh yes, struck by the realisation this is just civilisation\nIn the natal stages of industrialisation, trust me when I say\nThat previous achievements are just child's play\nCompared to this colossal school of thought\nWe set the world ablaze with fossil fuel we bought\nIt's an epiphany\nGiving us pretty much infinite energy\nIt's electricity\nEdison, Nikola Tesla - different inventors\nGiving us everything we depend on\nWhether it's engines, cinema, television or telecoms\nSending a message and spreading it on\nThese unreal frontier channels\nWe develop the tech and then sell it on\nThe reel travels round\nWith the speed of a machine gun's barrels\nMachinery's a meaner beast and we're still in the saddle\nNo need for cavalry - battle superseded that with ease\nAllies and Axis\nCharging each other like batteries\nA power vacuum allowing the superstates to flourish\nRedistribute the food even if it means people are malnourished\nPropaganda is the only view that you're allowed to publish\nCause totalitarians are well aware of how to punish\nGunning down numbers countless\nFor doubtless nothings that they've done\nBut that won't stop subversive insurgents\nFrom coming out with courage\nUsing their power to the fullest\nWhether creativity or demonstrating general relativity\nEvidently when we find time to be efficient\nEinsteinian clear vision can reveal the precision behind the blinds\nNuclear fission\nDespite derision\nPhysicists decide the mission is dividing, splitting atoms\n'Till a blinding light is given, quite efficient\nThe divine right to mankind's plight is christened\nA minor decision hijacked by politicians\nBut as long as they listen to the will of the people\nTreat all as brilliant equals, we can achieve more\nThan we've ever conceived before\n\n[Outro]\nLeave this poor place\nPlease explore space\nEarth, she's a small base\nEven more awaits\nI implore great leaders\nTo lead with all the grace\nOf which we're capable\nAnd be the author of your fate\nBand together and endeavour\nClasp our hands together\nAs our ancestors have\nAnd stand the test of time forever", "year": "2013-11-19"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
