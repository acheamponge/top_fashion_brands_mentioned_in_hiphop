All I know is that I had sad eyes when I did this\nThinking \u2018bout my future and the path that I chose, God knows I\u2019ma take a big risk\nBut I\u2019m prepared every little step of the way like Charles told me, gotta be ready\n\u2018Cause I admit that I\u2019m getting sick watching all these cats living my dream like they Freddy\nGive me just a chance just to prove to my fans that all that rooting for me wasn\u2019t in vain\nThey tell me, \u201cYou gon\u2019 make it to the top, I hope you know that!\u201d\nI love y\u2019all, I hope you know that\n\n[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]\nAnd we right where we need to be\nIt might suck right now, but it could be worse\nIt could be hearses instead of cavaliers\nSo you won\u2019t hear much nagging here\nI cried damn near every night, but I\u2019m not sensitive\nIt just hurts to be hurt\nWhen you give your last out of gratitude, just once you would like to be put first\nBut what\u2019s the point of working for acceptance if I am not accepted as is?\nYou can call me stubborn if you want, but I ain\u2019t gon\u2019 change, no, not one bit\nAnd this was kind of hard to flow to \u2018cause of this crazy time sig-na-ture\nBut learn the music theory and you, too, will see clearly\nCeven\n\n[Outro: Donnie Darko & Gretchen Ross (Sampled from Donnie Darko)]\nDon\u2019t look so freaked\nI\u2019m not\nYou should check your backpack, those guys love to steal shit\nYeah\nSo, why did you move here?\nMy parents got a divorce\nMy mom had to get a restraining order against my stepdad\nHe has emotional problems\nOh, I have those too\nWhat kind of emotional problems does your dad have?\nHe stabbed my mom four times in the chest\nOh\u2026 did he go to jail?\nNo, he fled\nThey still can\u2019t find him\nBut my mom and I had to change our names\nAnd I thought \u201cGretchen Ross\u201d was really cool\nI was in jail once\nI mean, I accidentally burned down this house\nIt was abandoned, but still, I\u2026\nI got held back in school\nAnd I can\u2019t drive until I\u2019m 21, you know\nBut I\u2019m over all of that, I, I\u2026\nI\u2019m painting and stuff, writing\nI want to be a writer or maybe a painter, I don\u2019t know, or maybe both\nI\u2019ll write a book and draw the pictures\nThen maybe people will understand me\nI don\u2019t know, change things\nDonnie Darko? What the hell kind of name is that?\nIt\u2019s like some sort of superhero or something\nWhat makes you think I\u2019m not?", "year": "2010-05-25", "album": "Volume: Three!
