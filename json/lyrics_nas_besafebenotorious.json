What it did have in the dark streets was a wild outburst of crime. Arson, looting, mugging, and a thousand false fire alarms. At 9:34 last night it all went black\n\n[Verse 1]\nI pour some Yac for the days of way back\nThe turn tables crates of wax turn to major to my earlier days\nMy world was ablaze, black outs in the summer\nNo electricity asked out\nBreaking down doors, my city was hungry\nWe vandalized stores, poor\nNo lights in the project hall\nBefore the lootin' only 5 DJ crews was movin'\nTill people stole DJ equipment the numbers risin'\nNow there's friction\nFirst time in Bronx history DJ's poppin' up, there's more mixin'\nEverybody wants to be Flash\nHis name on the flier\nThe Grandmaster performin' live, no acclaim was higher\nHe was king and the dream was to be like 'em\nMeanwhile C-Cypher's not around\nFirehouses shut down\nSchool was closed\nGrandmaster (?) our domes with rules\nWritten inside the rap scrolls\n\n[Interlude]\nThe revolution will not be televised\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe revolution may not be televised\nAnd we wonderin' who the hell is Koch\nThis man Koch wanted the mayor's seat\nAnd he's campaignin' like he can't be stopped\nUp in the Bronx they forever strong\nDon't ever try to play 'em weak\nThe revolution may not ever be televised\nBooks command the speech\n\n[Outro]\nI want to stress first my total outrage that at this hour the city of New York is still without power"}], "artist": "Nas"}
