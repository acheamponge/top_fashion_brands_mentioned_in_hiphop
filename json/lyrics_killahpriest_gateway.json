Dillinger and the millions of souls\nMany more will have to go, reason why? I don't know\n\nYou try to stay focus, watchin' for that day approaches\nYou got the coverage of the Lord's judgment\nThe blood rinse off your soft body\nThen placed in the arms of your mommy\nShe placed you in a potty\nFast forward, you in a staircase in your lobby\nWatchin' fiends goin' out on apartment 5-D\nWell I know this crackhead name Brother Lord\nAlways watchin' him huggin' the floor\nMany get high and many souls have to fly\nThe Bible says we all have to die\nYou look for reasons, I don't know why\nThis is where the ghetto spirits carve tonight\nNo owls in flight, no sound in sight\nAs we float like a cloud thru the dark light\nBarkin' of buncha old worn out dogs nobody wants\nHounds from hell, the starvin' night haunts\nThe flesh is unveiled, pure spirit unbothered by gravity\nA body weight to a Godly place\nThen drift into the internal night\nAs they take the eternal flight\nThey see your majesty, the Gatekeeper\nThe great weepers, the grave's deeper\nAnd the night is frostbit\nSo long back to the darkness\n\nThat's enough, your majesty, that's enough\nShhhhh... You're sworn into secrecy, say no more\nBut Father...\nNo one must know about the hidden door\nClose the door and move out the way\nClose the door"}]}
