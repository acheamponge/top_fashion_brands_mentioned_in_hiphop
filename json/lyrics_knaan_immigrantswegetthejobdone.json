Period]\nYou know, and it gets into this whole issue of border security, you know, who's gonna say that the borders are secure? We've got the House and the Senate debating this issue, and it's... it's really astonishing that in a country founded by immigrants, \"immigrant\" has somehow become a bad word. So the debate rages on and we continue....\n\n[Intro: \"Yorktown\" sample]\n[Hercules Mulligan]\nAnd just like that it\u2019s over, we tend to our wounded, we count our dead\n[John Laurens]\nBlack and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom\u2026\n[George Washington]\nNot yet\n\n[Verse 1: K\u2019Naan]\nI got 1 job, 2 job, 3 when I need them\nI got 5 roommates in this one studio, but I never really see them\nAnd we all came America trying to get a lap dance from Lady Freedom\nBut now Lady Liberty is acting like Hilary Banks with a pre-nup\nMan, I was brave, sailing on graves\nDon\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice those tombstones disguised as waves\nI\u2019m no dummy, here is something funny, you can be an immigrant without risking your lives\nOr crossing these borders with thrifty supplies\nAll you got to do is see the world with new eyes\n\n[Chorus]\nImmigrants, we get the job done\n\nLook how far I come\nLook how far I come\nLook how far I come\nWe get the job done\n\nLook how far I come\nLook how far I come\nLook how far I come\nImmigrants, we get the job done\n\n[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]\nIt\u2019s a hard line when you\u2019re an import\nBaby boy, it's hard times\nWhen you ain't sent for\nRacists feed the belly of the beast\nWith they pitchforks, rich chores\nDone by the people that get ignored\nYa se arm\u00f3\nYa se despertaron\nIt\u2019s a whole awakening\nLa alarma ya son\u00f3 hace rato\nLos que quieren buscan\nPero nos apodan como vagos\nWe are the same ones\nHustling on every level\nTen los datos\nWalk a mile in our shoes\nAbr\u00f3chense los zapatos\nI been scoping ya dudes, ya\u2019ll ain't been working like I do\nI'll outwork you, it hurts you\nYou claim I\u2019m stealing jobs though\nPeter Piper claimed he picked them, he just underpaid Pablo\nBut there ain't a paper trail when you living in the shadows\nWe're America's ghost writers, the credit's only borrowed\nIt\u2019s a matter of time before the checks all come\nBut\u2026\n\n[Chorus]\nImmigrants, we get the job done\n\nLook how far I come\nLook how far I come\nLook how far I come\nWe get the job done\n\nLook how far I come\nLook how far I come\nLook how far I come\nImmigrants, we get the job\u2014\nNot yet\n\n[Bridge: Snow Tha Product]\nThe credit is only borrowed\nIt\u2019s America's ghost writers, the credit's only borrowed\nIt\u2019s America's ghost writers\nAmerica's ghost writers\nAmerica's ghost writers, the credit's only borrow-borrowed\nIt\u2019s Americas ghost writers, a credit is only borrowed\nIt\u2019s Americas ghost writers, a credit is only borrowed\nIt\u2019s Americas ghost writers, a credit is only borrowed\nIt's\n\n[Hook]\nImmigrants, we get the job done\n\n[Verse 3: Riz MC]\nAy yo aye, immigrants we don\u2019t like that\nNa they don\u2019t play British empire strikes back\nThey beating us like 808\u2019s and high hats\nAt our own game of invasion, but this ain't Iraq\nWho these fugees what did they do for me\nBut contribute new dreams\nTaxes and tools, swagger and food to eat\nCool, they flee war zones, but the problem ain't ours\nEven if our bombs landed on them like the Mayflower\nBuckingham Palace or Capitol Hill\nBlood of my ancestors had that all built\nIt's the ink you print on your dollar bill, oil you spill\nThin red line on the flag you hoist when you kill\nBut still we just say \"look how far I come\"\nHindustan, Pakistan, to London\nTo a galaxy far from their ignorance\nCos-\n\n[Hook]\nImmigrants, we get the job done\n\n[Verse 4: Residente]\nPor tierra o por agua\nIdentidad falsa\nBrincamos muros o flotamos en balsas\nLa peleamos como Sandino en Nicaragua\nSomos como las plantas que crecen sin agua\nSin pasaporte americano\nPorque La mitad de gringolandia Es terreno mexicano\nHay que ser bien hijo e puta\nNosotros Les Sembramos el \u00e1rbol y ellos se comen la fruta\nSomos los que cruzaron\nAqu\u00ed vinimos a buscar el oro que nos robaron\nTenemos mas trucos que la polic\u00eda secreta\nMetimos la casa completa en una maleta\nCon un pico, una pala\nY un rastrillo\nTe construimos un castillo\nComo es que dice el coro cabr\u00f3n?\n\n[Chorus]\nImmigrants, we get the job done\n\nLook how far I come\nLook how far I come\nLook how far I come\nWe get the job done\n\nLook how far I come\nLook how far I come\nLook how far I come\nImmigrants, we get the job done\n\nLook how far I come\nLook how far I come\nLook how far I come\nImmigrants, we get the job done\n\nNot yet"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
