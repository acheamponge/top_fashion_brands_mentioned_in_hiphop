It's blown out of proportion\nAll the voices in my head sound distorted (do the right thing)\nAnd muffled, I'm stretching my faith muscle, this rap game's a hustle\nA struggle to stay humble and trust\nBig trouble, in little me, causing complications\nI run from confrontation, observations made from a distance\nMy defense to resist, I'm not convinced\nThat all my silhouettes can co-exist, so I drift\nInto the clouds of God's grace and freedom, feeling like these feelings\nIs filling me, with pride and negativity I don't need\nAnd even though at times I felt stepped on\nAnd taken for granted, it's time to heal from the damage\n\nLetting go, of something that you hold close\nWhy you let it stay around, you just don't know, say\nLet it Go\nLet it Go\nLetting go, of something that you hold close\nTried to make it work out, but it won't, say\nLet it Go\nLet it Go", "year": null, "album": "Shades of Grey"}], "artist": "Braille"}
