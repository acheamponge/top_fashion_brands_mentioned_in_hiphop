Martinez]\nYo, uh\nThe animals are here\nIt's a new day...yo yo uh\n\nIt's about being close to the ground\nLike dope fiends and not even fallin'\nSome people frontin' now they keep callin'\nBut that's life, ain't no grudge in my heart\nI could sleep mornings, that's the business\nI just keep that shit apart, that's the wisdom\n\nIn my position get hard, I deal wit people from far\nVery few I keep close, that's how you keep from the scars\nYou gotta move like a ghost, cause some people are stars\nAnd all of a sudden.. they forgot who they are\n\nBut look at me I'm still Angie, back wit a plan B\nIt's a new day you could sit down or stand me\nI just try to be an example, bringin' the animal out\nWhen everybody doubting underhand me\nIts ample time, If you could not see the big picture\nCause there's plenty ladies like me I'm a big sista\nAlways on the grind through whatever you say\nAnd just incase you ain't clear its okay\nIt's a new day!\n\n[Chours1: 2x]\nIf you need it to be, (uh) Then it can be (yea)\nIt happen for me, It's a new day (a new day)\n\n[Chours2: 2x]\nKeep hoping, Keep focus\nApproaching, up, A new day\n\nReaction to my first verse in a year it was clearly unexpected\nMe on a record, We must yea agree it was hectic\nGetting here half sleep and eating breakfast in my chair\nHow I feel, it's a new day now, that's for real\nI was prepared to deal wit, whatever was given\nPeople dissecting what I'm spitting on, not giving me a chance\nListen and understand, they ain't know how to react\nOff my 16 bars on that track, \"She out or she back Damn\"\nThen came a record (\"If I could go\")\nI'm not saying my shits perfected\nBut if I could go's the beginning accept it, connected\nYou already know, yes is an automatic question\nAutomatically answered cause I'm flowing like you never heard\nWhy second one it can't be said in words\nExcept it had to be done, in other words I'm leaving on top\nYou mad at me huh, believe it won't stop\nThe love it's much stronger you can not break my hunger\n\n[Hook1: 2x]\n[Hook2: 2x]\n\nSee they love for you to give up, can't wait for you to slip up\nAs soon as you hit rock bottom, they never picking you up\nOr never picking you out, they always out when you pick\nBut when your outfits is sick, or you got a hit\nThen every other word is, \"No Doubt\nWhen can we go out, When can we grab lunch,\" I only get mad once\nCause when you get mad twice you sacrifice then a punch\nAnd then a situation jumps so I grab a blunt\nRoll it and spark it cause you media targets\nPictures is blatant ya know what I'm saying\nThis ain't ancient this is today shit\nBut it's a new day shit no games get played shit\nNo time get wasted, I learn from the worst situations (\"yep\")\nAnd I made it, everything I had in my heart I pushed and gave it\nSo when I say it's a new day I mean it\nCause when it's the truth you must agree shit!\n\n[Hook1: 2x]\n[Hook2: 2x]\nYa hear me singing\n\n[Hook1: 2x]\n[Hook2: 2x]\nWe on our way\nAnimal house\nMacneezy", "year": null}]}
