Drop the gun\nYou could've prevented a tragedy\n\n[Verse 1: MC Ren]\nYou can approach, but the danger light is blinkin\nA self-desctruct button is activated when I'm thinkin\nThis is a tribulation, the weak is judged\nThe prophecy was fulfilled, cause I never budge\nI took up the tools, crucifixion was the extreme\nThey're seein doubles of me, but it wasn't a dream\nOne vision was of life, the other was death\nAnd life didn't give a fuck if death took your last breath\nSo you burn in my pit that I call hell\nWhere you got sent, because your shit don't sell\nMy twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke\nOf the niggas that I burned and tormented but I didn't choke\nI started doing them, I kept on doing them, two of them\nShoot them up until that nigga Ren was through with them\nAnd my presence to the suckers was of a stranger\nBut fuck it, they can approach to the danger\n\n[Interlude: Eazy-E]\nIf you can be seen, you can be hit\nIf you can be hit, you can be killed\n(He's over there! Shoot him!)\n\n[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]\nFatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangler\nOut run, the shot of a gun when the game's up\nMurder in the first degree, but it's worse to be\nA dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody\nWith everybody thinkin of death\nI kept workin, to be one of the last niggas left\nSo many people lookin for hope, they broke\nWithout checkin the fingerprints on a motherfucker's throat\nA heart of steel can reveal the real nigga in me\nSo figure to see, the D-E-A-D\nBodies like a nigga straight walkin in a cemetary\nSo it's very necessary to carry\nAmmunition for niggas wishin but they better take caution\nBefore Dre goes off\nAnd starts killin motherfuckers just in order to change the\nAnger for the real nigga when I approach to danger\n\n[Interlude]\nApproach the motherfuckin danger\n(\"Come back to hell and see me some time!\")\n(\"This is it y'all\")\n\n[Verse 3: Eazy-E]\nFinal approach to danger, death, destruction around every corner\nAnother dead body and you wanna keep runnin\nBut even the rain turns black\nAll you can do is stay alert and try to stay out of the searchlight\nNo prison, nobody makes bail\nEverybody gotta go but see it ain't no jail\nThink about death, takin your last breath\nHeart beatin like a motherfucker like it ain't no time left\nWith so many ways to stay up, I gotta get mine\nEven though they wanna make a crime, yo\nOf bein real, a federal letter in the beginnin\nBecause of the release of \"Fuck the Police\"\nFuck it I approach the danger\nCause I don't give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up\nSo you might as well kiss your ass goodbye\nCause in the long run (\"we all die\")", "album": "Efil4zaggin", "year": "1991-05-28", "title": "Approach to Danger", "image": "https://images.genius.com/378262f83025b434fc5375a332bd1a1f.800x800x1.png"}], "artist": "N.W.A"}
