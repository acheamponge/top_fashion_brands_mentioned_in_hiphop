Yo' momma?!\"\n\n[Aceyalone]\nI wrote a poem the other day\nI hope you like it\n\n[Hook]\nRoses are red, and violets are blue\nSugar is sweet love, but not as sweet as you\nBoogers are green, and doo-doo is brown\nLife is uphill but, not when you get down\nI said roses are red, and violets are blue\nSugar is sweet love, but not as sweet as you\nBoogers are green, and doo-doo is brown\nLife is uphill but, not when you get down\n\n[Aceyalone]\nSticks and stones, flesh and bones\n+Organic Electricity+ chromosomes\nI'm home alone, but not by choice\nI pick up the phone and I hear a strange voice\nHocus pocus, boogedy boo\nAbra-cadabra, what's a nigga to do?\nBack and forth, and open and closed\nAnd if you can't see through it then poke you some holes\nIt's like glass and dirt, water and sand\nThings tend to burn the hotter the pan\nLeft and right, and right and wrong\nWrong and guilty, convicted and hung\nYoung and old, and old and new\nKnew and never knew and tellin the truth\nIt's like black and blue, and battered and bruised\nAnd if you get away from this one then, that'll be news\nI said\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Aceyalone]\nJack and Jill, and +Jill+ and +Scott+\nScotch and soda, a twisted plot\nBums and cops, covers and quilts\nPillows and blankets, cottons and silks\nMind so heavy hope the bed don't tilt\nCuts and welts, and screams for help\nEat and sleep, shit shower and shave\nWork and play, cradle to the grave\nIt's all for nothin, or nothin at all\nIt's all for one, and one for all\nYou better look up at me like I'm ten feet tall\nCause you're lookin down at me like I'm two feet small\nHopes and wishes, wishes and dreams\nIt's ugly and dirty, I wish it was clean\nWin or lose, smoke or booze\nAnd if you get away from this one then, that'll be news\nI mean\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Aceyalone]\nReady or not, sweaty and hot\nTired and hungry but haven't forgot\nGuns and shots, runs and drops\nOr buried alive under tons of rocks\nA beautiful day, a wonderful night\nA suitable pasttime just rockin the mic\nA day in the life, a life in a day\nYou know when they comin so you might get away\nSpace and time, nickels and dimes\nBass and rhyme that tickle your spine\nA brand new mind, a fresh design\nOne of a kind, seek and you find\nHomies and crews, weapons and tools\nLovers and haters and teachers and fools\nJust try walkin one day in my socks and shoes\nAnd if you get away from this one then, that'll be news\nIt's like\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Not When You Get Down", "album": "Hip Hop and the World We Live In", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dde48df06ccd165a12ed0bc40d9c736e.500x500x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
