Yo I don't know\nBut Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the story should go\n\n[Interlude: Little Russ]\nYeah money, that's it, yeah money, that's it\nThis is Little Russ in the house\nRock that shit homey, rock that shit!\n[Well, you know the rest]\n\n[Ice Cube]\nHumpty Dumpty sat on a wall\nWith a joint, drinkin some 8-ball\nThree little pigs in a Coup de Ville\nLookin for, the wolf to kill\nThey're fucked up and they want revenge\nThem and Humpty used to be friends\nNow they're enemies cause he's a traitor\nPulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him\nCinderella hoeing for the fellas\nAnd Mister Rogers is gettin mighty jealous\nOf the cash that the pigs were makin\nTime for the pigs to get turned to bacon\nCause Mister Rogers found out quick\nThat Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits\nThey said that the motherfuckin wolf was next\nSo Mister Rogers better watch his step\nSo he let the wolf know\nWe're gonna fuck up the pigs, and take their ho\nCause Cinderella is much too fast\nBefore twelve, givin up ass\nDouble barrels all loaded and cocked\nAs soon as they show, they gonna get popped\nThey bailed down Sesame Street and caught em\nLittle Boy Blue is up front givin orders\nLittle did they know Cinderella was a fink\nShe called the cops and got thrown in the clink\nA bad influence?
