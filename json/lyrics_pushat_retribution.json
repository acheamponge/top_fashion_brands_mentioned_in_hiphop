She used to fly on a buddy pass\nThey say when the money go, you hope that your honey last\nI been preaching since money, cash\u2014 hoes\n\n[Hook: Kehlani]\nAnd I promise, I hardly see you\nFrom where I am it\u2019s so hard to see you\nGot money I\u2019ve been different ever since\nMaybe it\u2019s me and my arrogance\nWho are you, who are you anyway?\nWho are you, who are you anyway?\nWho are you? We don\u2019t know you\nWho are you? We don\u2019t know you\n\n[Verse 2: Pusha T]\nI\u2019m the fire and the base\nI\u2019m admired by the greats\nThis to each and every rap nigga\nI look you liars in the face\nCold case, Rolls Wraith\u00a0\nBig dipper, constellation in the ceiling, see the stars\nSee the jewelry, all rock, no guitar\u00a0\nWho you know better with the raw?\nBogota, she like finessing niggas\nShe gets a Range Rover Sport\u00a0\nAnd got seats on the court from the best of niggas\nI never bit at that apple\nI never lost my El Chapo\nI can still grab it, and bag it and capsule\u00a0\nCovered in white like I walked in the chapel\nI\u2019m that cold\n\n[Hook: Kehlani]\nAnd I promise, I hardly see you\nFrom where I am it\u2019s so hard to see you\nGot money I\u2019ve been different ever since\nMaybe it\u2019s me and my arrogance\nWho are you, who are you anyway?\nWho are you, who are you anyway?\nWho are you? We don\u2019t know you\nWho are you? We don\u2019t know you\n\n[Verse 3: Pusha T]\nThe last dope dealer\nRed leather in a room full of Thrillers\nThe mamas, they zombies\nChase a nigga for the money, they behind me\nWoo, safe look like it got a printer\nAin\u2019t no rappers in that Sprinter\nAin\u2019t no saints, only sinners\nWhat bitch ain\u2019t fucked a winner?\nI\u2019m a blue ribbon nigga\nTalk down on you two pigeon niggas\nFront five or better\nYeah, I got a mountain of it, you could climb forever", "year": "2015-12-18"}]}
