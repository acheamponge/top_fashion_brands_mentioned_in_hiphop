Bitch, I'm one of the best\nI'm from the gutter for real, me like so many others\nWho know so much about it, and tryina get up out it\nWhat I'm wantin they got it, I'm gon' get it, don't doubt it\nAsk somebody about it, pivot to stay in pocket\nChoppin and get it poppin, stop before my life roll past me\nYou know what I'm 'bout, no need to ask me why\n\n[ Chorus ]"}], "artist": "Big Mike"}
