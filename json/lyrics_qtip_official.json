Then we're correlative\nBusta is ferocious, unflawed and precocious\nAirin' fools out cause my willy bodacious\nPeoples don't blame me, shorties can't game me\nCountry Cherokee, but the city here made me\nRock like coral, distinctive 'bout my orals\nGot lil' grime and got a lotta laurels\nThe rhythm stay bangin, my one-two thangin\nIs exemplified by the comp left hangin\nPercussion's our weapons, drums are Smith & Wesson's\nLyrics poppin' off, leavin' deep impressions\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI feel what the beat does, people fuck with me cause\nWhen the song end, I become what the beat was\nSame thing as other, no need for cookie cutter\nThe bar gets raised, not your average old gutter\nFor that I hit a chin up, B, ya time been up\nWould've came sooner, but I overslept my get-up\nNow let's get in the middle, girl, I'll solve your riddle\nCause we can be strong and protect against the brittle\nIf dudes need to see me, go and get the CD\nI'll aerosol your wall top to bottom like graffiti\nBismillah-in', dudes sound pardon [?]\nWhen you hear the music, thus begins the Mardi Gras-in'\nRhymes ain't the issue, that's how I'm gon' get you\nDon't need a Billboard hit for me to hit you\nThe clairvoyant micist, who always come the tightest\nQueens everywhere, demonstratin' who the flyest\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Q-Tip"}
