Fool, what it do?\nIt's Don't Hate the Player Part 2\nHow you like me now? Fool, what it do?\nIt's Don't Hate the Player Part 2\n\n[Hook 4X]\nIf you hate the player, you hate the game\n\n[Verse 2]\nMan, you been actin' kinda strange lately\nBecause your bitch licked and ate me?\nIf you hate me, you hate the game\nIt's a fuckin' shame like what's his name\nIt's nothin', mayne, you didn't need her\nShe's raw, she jawed me in her two-seater\nA two-liter in her mouth I busted\nShake the broad, dog, she can't be trusted\nShe put mustard on my hot dog\nAnd paid a pimp before she shook the spot, dog\nI'm top dog, don't hate it\nEvery rims I skated was chrome plated\nI made it, I'm successful\nAnd you hate it 'cause your life is so stressful\nThings get a little easier\nYou gotta get cheesier and more peasier", "year": "2004-10-19", "album": "The Game is Thick Part 2", "title": "Don\u2019t Hate the Player 2"}], "artist": "Mac Dre"}
