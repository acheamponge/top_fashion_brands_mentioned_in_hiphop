I can't hear you\nLets skip the chit chat, shut up and sit back\nI'm a teach you how to drive stick, now grip that\nAmateurs hit the do', can't get it if you slow\nWhy I need a chick who can't handle it like a pro\nWorkin those curves that can flip my whip\nGrip them hips like my tires grip the strip\nYou hear my speakers pump, makin you scream when I beat it up\nI got your engine revin just to heat it up\nHit it fast till whiplash affects your neck\nThis ain't bout racin it's all bout um um\n\n[Hook] {X2}\nI know you want to hold it, but its hard to control it\nI drive it like I stole it, drive it I stole it\nI push it till I roll it, and somebody gotta tow it\nI drive it like I stole it, drive it I stole it\n\n[Verse Two]\nI give gas to the ass and spin it around\nAnd the centrifugal force is pinnin you down\nA lot of these broads are brainless, barely an acquaintance\nWho'll probably give me brains if I pull up in a vanquish\nAdvanced and tricked out when I pull the whip out my garage\nShe's like oh my gosh and flipped out\nGettin' out calm, activate the alarm\nPimped out, incognito, and tinted out\nA superstar in the car, people tryin to figure out\nGot you in the back seat, make it rock, two shocks squeak\nWe'll freak in the parking lot, spot two cops creep\nIf you wanna ride, I wanna know how it feel inside\nRotate the bass so you feel it side to side\nShift into fifth, so she quickly reached down\nShe needs more speed now\n\n[Hook]", "year": null}]}
