Medeiros]\nOn an account of the cost\nBeing thee amount of the cross\nBeing me don\u2019t amount to the loss\nYou see me, know my fountain of flaws\nTo free me off a mountain I toss\nInto the deep sea breathin out thee exhaust\nInhaling the frost of cold summers\nThe cost of sailing, I\u2019m lost with no compass\nThe cause and effect witch I pause to reflect\nFor a moment, taught to respect the atonement\nI own it, and walk these steps as a grown man\nWhere talk is a weapon that holds man\nI fought with this lesson with no hands\nTrying to know my Savior it\u2019s a Risk\nWhen your wrists are dying to hold Asia\nIt\u2019s a mind over nations of millions\nThe face of our children\nThe chase for the safety in buildings\nThat make it so yielding is never an option\nThe willing to weather whatever it costs them\n\n[Manchild]\n\nPut it on the line like rhymes that we write\nWith a pad and pen before we spit it on the mike\n\nAdd it up for ?? and got the information put in to the book\nA snooker to the lie for every ?? hook line and sinking in\nKids check it out and turn the pages until they think again\n?? read it in between the hash marks convert it into cliff notes\nAccelerate the fast starts\n?? the plan B before you move past freedom ?? even start to understand me\nTelling me when you may freeze\nBefore you weave that reasoning into the fabric of the grand scheme\n?? overcomposition at large points to the Heavens identify who's in charge\nBar none hard rocks\nLadies with ??\n??\nCall it what you want from big dreams to far flung\nIt don't stop till the wars won\n\nHey DJ Idol can I get an introduction\nComon man let's do this\nI want to rock right now\n\n[Braille]\nDo the mathematics, algebra and calculus\nI counted the cost, accounted for the counterfeit\nWhen I encountered it, stood my ground and the coward quit\nCause he's powerless, so many challenges exist\nCalculate the catalyst, cause and effect\nFrom catastrophic events, we gotta catapult past it\nCast away doubt, it returns sevenfold, tell them \"get out\"\nThis is my temple, my house, take control of your body\nReject the venom, yo their bugging out, better grab the insect repellent\nMy rebellion, rocking the bells from Belgium\nTo Bella Bella to Boston and back to Bellingham\nThe mailman playing my role, no more John Stockton\nI'm Karl Malone, slamming it home on microphones\nI'm in the zone, lyrics and poems\nFlow through my chromosomes and penetrate domes\nI wanna rock right now, come on\nIt's been a long road driven by purpose\nAnd I know it's worth it\nI wanna rock right now, come on\n\nI added it up and I counted the cost\nI understand the risk, I'm gonna carry my cross\nDo it like this\nBefore you make your move calculate the risk", "year": null, "album": "The IV Edition"}], "artist": "Braille"}
