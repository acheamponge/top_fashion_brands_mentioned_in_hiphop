'Dopeman'\n\n[XV]:\nGot sick of niggas asking, I jumped up and got my acid\nTo the booth, no pen and pad except the walls that's in this room\nAt 14 I was slanging at 15 I got my name and\nPushed my albums like it's dope so there's no intentions on changing\nFive knocks on the door was the arrangement\nSorry, I retract that statement until my nigga's arrainment\nIt was hard for me to slang it\nKareem told me to weigh it\nAnd I cut it like Jason's vacation in that Crystal Lake Inn\nOooh\nDid I kill 'em with that?\nFinal Fantasy potents couldn't heal 'em from that\nSo ain't nobody stopping it\nEnjoy, sit back, start watching it\nColder than a polar bear and we just polar opposites\nYou mean, I'm nice yo\nLoosey, tight flow\nFull meal, rice bowl\nI'm ill, night cold\nHype Will, Spike Jonze\nAll State, Geicko\nScarface, Esco, Dopeman, let's go\n\n[Sample Hook]:\n\"Dopeman please can I have another hit\" - N.W.A.
