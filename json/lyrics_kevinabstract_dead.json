You really think that mane\nLosing my brain\nBut nah I ain't lost it\nColors start changing now ya boy is coughing\nGetting nauseas\nHead back to my apartment\nGrab all of my belongings\nCatch the next train to Boston\nThe police gotta description of me\nI left my brother on the ground bloody\nMy other brothers with my foster family\nI'mma head out they won't be missing nothing\nAt least, that's what I thought\nLooking back like damn it's all my fault\nI let these thoughts creep into my mind and eat me up real late\nWhile I'm siting there staring at my reflection inside my dinner plate\nWith a knife in my hand suicidal thoughts approach\nCatch my self in my room it is gloom light a roach\nLittle bro deserves a toast\nSo I wrote him this song\nSorry homie, took me so long\nI'm the type to\nNah fuck that\nLet all that sink in for a minute\nMy bad Derek\nYou wanna kill me now?\nYou wanna kill me now?"}], "artist": "Kevin Abstract"}
