Holding down this block? It ain't nothing\nYou the man nigga, now stop fronting\nHahah, I like your style (Nah, I like your style)\nLet's drive around awhile! Cool, nigga\nHere's a thou', A G? I ride with you for free\nI want the long-term riches and bitches\nHave it all, now listen to me\nYou let them other niggas get the name, skip the fame\nTen thou' or a hundred G keep your shit the same\n(On the low?) Yeah, the only way to blow\nYou let your shit bubble quietly (AND THEN YOU BLOW!)\nKid, keep your cool\nThe only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand\nThen you play your cards, then he through dealing I understand\nDon't blow your dough on hotties\nThe only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts\nAnd won't break them for nobody\nHah, I like your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, pick a day, you can start\nFrom now until death do us part, nigga (Right!)\n\n[Chorus: Jay-Z & (Memphis Bleek)]\nIt's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)\nGots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)\nIt's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)\nGots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)\nIt's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)\nGots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)\nIt's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)\nGots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)", "title": "Coming of Age", "image": "https://images.genius.com/18040c4f503942a16d6577d9820644cb.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "1996-06-25", "album": "Reasonable Doubt"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
