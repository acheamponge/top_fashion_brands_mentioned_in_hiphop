No place to hide\nAnd I gotta leave my whole world behind me; my dog and my double wide\n\n[Verse 1: Boondox]\nYou might call me pathetic; you might say that I've lost my mind\nSitting here in the driveway baby and clutching on a forty-five\nBut you did me so wrong and I can't say I understand\nNow I'm about to blow your brains out bitch into the arms of another man\nI caught you creeping and now you going to be sleeping\nWith the worms in the dirt, what the fuck was you thinking?\nDo I look like the kind of motherfucker you can cheat on\nYou looking like a fucking whore I can beat on\nBut I never touch, never laid a single hand\nNor hair on your head, never touch a single strand\nWhile I sitting here knowing what's about to happen\nThere going to get me for domestic because the pistol did the slappin'\n\n[Hook: Violent J]\nNow I'm on the run; on the run from it all\nI'd rather be shot dead then locked up with the law\nI'm running... No place to hide\nAnd I gotta leave my whole world behind me; my dog and my double wide\n\n[Verse 2: Boondox]\nStanding here in our bedroom, with your body laid on the ground\nTwo dead motherfuckers looking silly with they blood sprayed all around\nAnd I'm sitting here thinking where the fuck am I going to go\nBurn the whole motherfucking trailer to the dirt and it's off to Mexico\nAdios motherfuckers see you later\nWhen I kicked in the door of a double wide trailer\nAnd I saw your fucking titties steady bouncing like Hydraulics\nAnd the next door neighbor had you folded like a wallet\nAnd I got to really say I was kind of impressed\nThe way your heels of your feet was driving into your chest\nAnd I hate to interrupt while he's giving it to you\nThe last thing you saw was his face in my boot\n\n[Hook: Violent J]\nNow I'm on the run; on the run from it all\nI'd rather be shot dead then locked up with the law\nI'm running... No place to hide\nAnd I gotta leave my whole world behind me; my dog and my double wide\n\n[Bridge: Boondox]\nThey ain't never gonna catch me, I won't do a lick of time\nI'll live on a beach under an umbrella getting blow back sipping wine\nAnd while your laid out burning, looking crispy like some KFC\nDo a little soul searching motherfucker cause you never should've fucked with me\n\n[Hook: Violent J]\nNow I'm on the run; on the run from it all\nI'd rather be shot dead then locked up with the law\nI'm running... No place to hide\nAnd I gotta leave my whole world behind me; my dog and my double wide\nAnd I can't take nothing, nothing at all\nGotta leave my bucket, my toaster and my saw\nHad a poster of Stone Cold still up on the wall\nHad to leave town in a hurry, tell the police I said fuck y'all", "image": "https://images.genius.com/880085d49aff9217e77dc1187f030306.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
