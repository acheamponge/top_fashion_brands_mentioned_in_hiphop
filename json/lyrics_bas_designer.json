And nigga hate to brag but it show\nI been out collectin' bags 'cause the tape a classic\nTold myself I would make it happen\n\n[Hook]\nFly to Japan, seen a panda like Desiigner\nFly out to London, the drugs was like designer\nFly out to France, bought some pants that was designer\nDid that by design, I did that by designin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/23ef4eb66941314c912f2371d63eb397.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2018-08-24", "title": "Designer", "album": "Milky Way"}]}
