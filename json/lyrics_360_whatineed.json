I need some sort of help for now\nI speak to anyone who thinks that they can help me out\nI've held it out in front, I'm feeling kind of guilty though\nThat if I didn't change my ways it woulda killed me slowly\nMy shields up 'cause real love conceals me\nAnd when she knows the real me whether she'll really feel me\n\n[Chorus: 360 & Countbounce]\nAll these words might be hard for you to see\nIt's honesty, what I really need for me\nIt's all real what I need in her to be\nAnd this song in itself sums up exactly what I need\n\n[Verse 2: 360]\nIt took me years to reach the level where I'm at\nThat confused way of thinking, yo, I'll never get it back\nAnd you've got years to grow, I know it takes time\nBut I can't be your boyfriend and your teacher at the same time\n'Cause I need you on the same level I'm at\n'Cause where I'm at now my brain's at a climax\nAnd why's that? 'Cause I learnt to love my own company\nAnd underneath my blood I've got a lot of love for me\nYour physical's good if were bumpin' for the night\nBut what turns me on is if you're doing something with your life\n'Cause I'm gonna wanna chick who's ambitious\nPassionate too and who sticks to plans, listens\nAnd got her shit together and she's hardly in need\nOpen honesty, always wears her heart on her sleeve\nAnd that's it, when you find yourself you'll find me\nBut this song in itself sums up exactly what I need\n\n[Chorus: 360 & Countbounce]\nAll these words might be hard for you to see\nIt's honesty, what I really need for me\nIt's all real what I need in her to be\nAnd this song in itself sums up exactly what I need\n\n[Verse 3: 360]\nI know it ain't easy to say ya need me\nBelieve me, I'm gonna be pushed away if you needy\nNeed and want, they're two separate identities\nBut now you're in a state where you'll go and try anythin'\nTo be around me, can't be alone by yourself\nDon't rely on me though, because I won't be your help\nThat's not harsh, I'm actually helping you in the long run\nBut once you found your feet you'll go and get that job done\nBut that don't mean that I'll never be around\n'Cause I'm here whenever I can, whenever you be down\nBut if I'm the only thing that can pick you up\nI can't have that pressure whenever all of this shit gets tough\nYou gotta sort all your own shit out first\nWork it out yourself when you're feelin' like an outburst\nThis song's here and it's out to help\nBut know you'll find me once you've found yourself\nIt shows\n\n[Chorus (Extended): 360 & Countbounce]\nAll these words might be hard for you to see\nIt's honesty, what I really need for me\nIt's all real what I need in her to be\nAnd this song in itself sums up exactly what I need\nAll these words might be hard for you to see\nIt's honesty, what I really need for me\nIt's all real what I need in her to be\nAnd this song in itself sums up exactly what I need"}]}
