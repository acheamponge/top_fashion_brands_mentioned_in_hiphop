Kelly's video\n\n[Verse Four: D'Angelo]\nWhy the both of you's bleeding so much?\nWhy the both of you's bleeding so much?\nWhy the both of you's bleeding so much? So much yeah\nWhy am I wearing handcuffs? Why am I\n\n[Hook]", "album": null, "year": "1997-01-01", "title": "Shit, Damn, Motherfucker (Remix)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7bd96dc5608785b57241a8e467a88fce.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "D\u2019Angelo"}
