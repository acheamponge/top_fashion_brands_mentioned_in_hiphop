Mills\nYoung Favorites\nI'm hella gone right now\nYa know, around the clock\nThat's why I got all this shit\nBut uh, fuck it\nYou know, it's like this\n\nI just woke up and I'm still high\nWipe the sleep up out my eyes\nFind some weed to my surprise\nAnd a couple girls by my side\nWith their clothes all on the floor\nHangin' panties on my door\nThinkin' bout' the night before\nLike, damn my hips are sore\n\n([Hook] x2])\n\nWon't stop, till I drop\nSmoke some weed and take a shot\nBright lights, livin' life\nYeah, this girl's lookin' right\n\nDon't stop, make it hot\nWatchin' all these bottles poppin' oh\nOh oh oh oooh!\nOh oh oh oooh!\n\nVerse 2:\nI got a girl who look like Ke$ha, yeah she hella sick\nAnd I got these ladies going Gaga on my disco stick\nTell her wait in line\nUnless they fine\nCause' for them, I'll make some time\nAnd if the bitch looks like my ex, I might just hit it from behind\nYO!\nShe's gunna take her jeans off\nThen lick this whipped cream off\nWhen we TIK TOK, around the clock\nAnd we both don't stop till I end up on top\nAnd she likes it when I hit that spot\nFuck in my room and we never got caught\nHeeeeh! Naaah. You remember that, don't you? Okay!\n\n[Hook x2]\n\nVerse 3:\nI spend my time like my money\nBurnin' holes in my pockets, yeaaaah!\nTonight is just one of many\nI won't let nothin' stop it\nLet nothin' stop it\nLet nothin' stop it\nI'll never stop (can't stop)\nI'll never stop (i want it)\nI'll never stop (baby, livin' it up)\nWe can't stop (can't stop)\nWe can't stop (i want it)\nWe can't stop (can't stop)\nWe can't stop livin' it up\n\n[2 CLAPS]\n\n[Hook x2]"}], "artist": "T.
