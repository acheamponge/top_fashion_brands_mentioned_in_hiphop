know\nCheck that shit, Lynch\nIt's the devil\n\n[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]\nYeah, the cap busting never stops\nI got my clips and my Glocks\nA bunch of motherfuckers give me props\nFunny style fools, though\nThat's why I never Lynch Hung with the crews, loc\nNever caught slipping, I knew I had to have mine (yeah)\nSo, I hooked up with my folks who hooked a nigga with a nine\nNow I got my own back fade\nAnd once ya start shooting at fools, you better have your own grave made\nFool named Blackie spitting at everybody 'bout\nHow he was hard and was knocking niggas out\nI see some envious of the Lynch Hung\nEvery time I talk to 'em, fools say he just bought another gun\nAnd I can feel 'em from a mile away\nFronting like he all that shit but like my nigga say\nDepending on a nigga gets a nine in my back\nSo, hey, I got my own back fade, nigga\n\n[Chorus: The Devil & Brotha Lynch Hung]\nYeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back\nYeah, I got my own back fade\nYeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back\nYeah, I got my own back fade\nYeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back\nYeah, I got my own back fade\nYeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back\nYeah, I got my own back fade\n\n[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]\nNigga, I thought you knew you couldn't fade this\nAll them props you got ain't but fake shit\nTrying to run up on a Uzi with a nine clip\nAnd find your brain cooking in a barbecue pit (yeah)\n'Cause I don't play that shit, loc, and I ain't soft\nBout your rumors Gimmy got his mouth shot off\nThen, his head cut off just for fucking up\nWith a nigga that got a room full of baby gut\nWhen I was peeping it I was tripping off of what I seen\nDumb nigga, you fronting on the wrong team\nI could've had you with a click getting hella props\nNow you running around like a monkey with his head cut off\nFucking with me\nNo, checking my nine pops\nLeaving a nigga with a mouth full of gun shots\nBy a lunatic nigga sporting some old clothes\nI'm like some paid to filling bodies full of bullet holes\nAnd I can feel 'em from a mile away\nFronting like they all that shit but like my nigga say\nDepending on a nigga gets a nine in my back\nSo, hey, I got my own back fade, nigga\n\n[Chorus: The Devil & Brotha Lynch Hung]\nYeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back\nYeah, I got my own back fade\nYeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back\nHey, I got my own back fade\nYeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back\nYou know, I got my own back fade\nYeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back\nHey, I got my own back fade\n\n[The Devil]\nYeah you know what I'm saying\nI'm the so-called Devil that Brotha Lynch was talking about, you know\nAnd can't nobody fade this\nThis nigga packs his own people, you know what I'm saying\nBut with this cannibalistic fury, you know what I'm saying\nSo, um, Lynch help me with this shit, kick that old shit\n\n[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]\nMost of my niggas come and go like a fool's life\nA couple of 40's and a joint laid up nothing not\nThat's why I'm kicking with the hardest motherfucker living\nMy nigga nine eating humans like Thanksgiving\nAnd it be eating em by the fours, at least\nMarinating niggas skin like a thick slab of roast beef\nThen, I'm cooking 'em while I'm fiending for fee\nDrinking a 40, eat some human meat and sit and watch my teeth bleed\nAin't a motherfucker out trying to feel me\nAbout a million motherfuckers wanna kill me\nThat's why nina got 16 partners\nSmoking a nigga for my human meat pot luck\nClick, pop, buckshots through a nigga's chest\nNigga ribs in my mouth, now who's next\nI got the menu of a motherfucking cannibal\nAs I continue, I'm a human eating niggaro\nEating niggas with my nine, so, hey\nYou fronting like your all that shit but like my niggas say\nDepending on a nigga gets a nine in my back\nSo, hey, I got my own back fade, nigga\n\n[Chorus: The Devil & Brotha Lynch Hung]\nYeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back\nYeah, I got my own back fade\nYeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back\nYeah, I got my own back fade\nYeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back\nYeah, I got my own back fade\nYeah, depending on a nigga gets a nine in my back\nYeah, I got my own back fade\n\n[Verse 4: Brotha Lynch Hung]\nComing straight from the grave with the rip gut\nCannibal Atheist, couldn't give a motherfuck\nHeard a lot of motherfuckers wanna stop this\nI keep em paralyzed, young, monotonous\nThough I pop shit something like a blood vessel\nDrink blood like a vamp, then, become amped\nThat means I take all the pussy and you get the fist\nGrab a leg like a wishbone and make a wish\nPop, yeah there it goes first love lead\nTo a bed full of pussy bleeding bloodshed\nNow I'm psyched 'cause I know a nigga wants some\nHe better pack a gun or know how to run\nAnd I ain't met too many niggas that could eat meat\nLike a nigga with a mouth full of crooked teeth\nAnd I'm a motherfucker that thrive on homosapien beef\nThem niggas don't know I'm seriously crazy\nAnd I can feel 'em from a mile away\nFronting like they all that shit but like my nigga say\nDepending on a nigga gets a nine in my back\nSo, hey, I got my own back fade, nigga\n\n[The Devil]\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha", "year": "1993-11-08", "album": "24 Deep"}], "artist": "Brotha
