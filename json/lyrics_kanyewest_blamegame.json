You to blame?\nMe to blame? For the pain\nAnd it poured every time when it rained\nLet's play the blame game\n\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nLet's play the blame game, I love you more\nLet's play the blame game for sure\n\n[Interlude: Kanye West]\n\"Things used to be, now they not\nAnything but us is who we are\nDisguising ourselves as secret lovers\nWe've become public enemies\nWe walk away like strangers in the street\nGone for eternity\nWe erased one another\nSo far from where we came\nWith so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?\nLack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E\nHatred and attitude tear us entirely\"\n\u2014Chloe Mitchell\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nLet's play the blame game, I love you more\nLet's play the blame game for sure\nLet's call out names, names, I hate you, more\nLet's call out names, names, for sure\n\n[Bridge: Kanye West]\nI can't love you this much, I can't love you this much\nI can't love you this much, I can't love you this much\nI can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much\nI can't love you this much, I can't love you this much\n\n[Outro: Kanye West]\nAnd I know that you are somewhere doing your thing\nAnd when the phone called it just ring and ring\nYou ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back\nAnd I heard the whole thing\nI heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing\n\n[\"The Best Birthday\": Chris Rock & Salma Kenas]\nOhh, my God\nBaby, you done took this shit to another motherfucking level!\nNow, a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be getting no pussy like this\nGoddamn, Goddamn!\nWho taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?\n(Yeezy taught me)\nYou never used to talk dirty, but now you God damn disgusting!\nMy\u2014my God, where'd you learn that?\n(Yeezy taught me)\nLook at you, motherfucking butt-ass-naked...\nWith them motherfucking Jimmy Choos on...\nWho taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?\n(Yeezy taught me)\nYo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level!\nThis is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now!
