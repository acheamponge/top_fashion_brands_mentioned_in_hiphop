Marshall Mathers\n\n[Hook]\nWalking the fine line, stomping in prime time\nStripping down your neck, now you're living the die time\nDon't hold back, I don't take jack\nMy shit is tabu, like my sister's ass crack\n\n[Verse 2]\nCall the FBI to secure this operation\nIce is penetrating all across this damn nation\nA diabolical philosophy, I'm breathing\nMicrophone phenon, you eating my semen\nYou got phobia, get off my sister's lobia\nTrailer park trash, get off my ball sac\nComing through with the wickedness\nYo, I'm true to kicking this\nTry to stop me, Hah don't be ridiculous\n\nExhale!\n\n[Hook]\nWalking the fine line, stomping in prime time\nStripping down your neck, now you're living the die time\nDon't hold back, I don't take jack\nMy shit is tabu, like my sister's ass crack", "album": "Bi-Polar: Skabz", "image": "https://images.genius.com/59251b7fa08499183d8cba480fbeeb28.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
