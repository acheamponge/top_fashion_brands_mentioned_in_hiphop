You naughty\nFind some paper and a pencil or a pen quick\nWrite down everything you ain't did yet\nWrite down all the things that you wanna do\nThat's probably all the things I'm gon' do to you\nIf not now then the next time we get up\nWhen you think about get your 'uh' all wet up\nMeet me at your place we can go head up\nAnd let me see that look, I wanna see that look now\n\n[Pre-Hook]\n\n[Pre Hook + Hook]\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Arrive", "album": "Shine Through"}], "artist": "Aloe Blacc"}
