'cause I know the hood too dangerous\nI just want him to see better things 'cause all my lil' niggas bangin'\nAyy\n\n[Chorus]\nOnly chase after bands, fuck a ho\nFor 22 I'ma ball like a pro\nGot a check then I ran it up some mo\nLike damn, I remember we was poor\nSeen a lot I done been there before\nI only speak on the things that I know\nCut 'em off, and they true colors show\nLife goes on, people come and go", "year": "2019-06-17"}]}
