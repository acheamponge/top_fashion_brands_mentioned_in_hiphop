Diggity- go girl, you need to go for it\nJordan 4s won't find me in no loafers\nHold up, Maryland, I am so tour\nI've been so thorough, that's what I boast for\nI know you thinking, \"I ain't gotta go there\"\nYou sitting at the bar wearing Barbaro's hair\nYeah, that ain't you love, you can't fool love\nBlue eyes but she blacker than Kunta\nWe don't believe you, you need more people\nYou need more grease in your hair, so they weaves you\nShake your hair like them track ain't coming out\nBartender, no ice, bring another shot\nAnd I ain't tryna be trife when I call 'em out\nI just call it like I see, know what I'm talking 'bout?\n\nI gotta tell you right now\nAs much as I wanna leave\nI gotta know if it's real or not\nAin't nothing fake about me\nSo if you wanna leave\nI gotta know if it's real or not\nIs it real or not?", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/e0cde0eabe61c1ddca97cce2386792d2.421x421x1.jpg"}]}
