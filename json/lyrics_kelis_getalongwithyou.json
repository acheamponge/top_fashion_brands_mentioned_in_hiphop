You deny me\nNow I'm forced to roam this planet\nSadly, lonely like some loose spigot\n\n[Chorus]\nYou took my heartbeat from me\nThis is the saddest story\nWhat was wrong with my love?\nYou took my heartbeat from me\nWas it I loved you poorly?\nWhatever it was, I just wanna get along with you\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't need no car\nDon't need no truck\nDon't need no vehicles\n'Cause I just wanna get along with you\nNo planes, don't need no trains\nDon't need to be passenger\nCause I just wanna get along with you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTry me 'cause I'd be\nThe one that makes you happy\nBut the part that I don't get is\nWhy me? You deny me\nNow I'm forced to roam this planet\nSadly, lonely like some loose spigot\n\n[Chorus]\nYou took my heartbeat from me\nThis is the saddest story\nWhat was wrong with my love?\nYou took my heartbeat from me\nWas it I loved you poorly?\nWhatever it was, I just wanna get along with you\n\n[Verse 3]\nDon't need these clothes\nDon't need this house\nDon't need this land or skies\nCause I just wanna get along with you\nThese eyes, don't need these thighs\nAs a matter of fact this damn life\nCause I just wanna get along with you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nTry me 'cause I'd be\nThe one that makes you happy\nBut the part that I don't get is\nWhy me? You deny me\nNow I'm forced to roam this planet\nSadly, lonely like some loose spigot\n\n[Chorus]\nYou took my heartbeat from me\nThis is the saddest story\nWhat was wrong with my love?\nYou took my heartbeat from me\nShould have just stabbed it for me\nFrom ashes to dust\nI just wanna get along with you\n\n[Interlude]\nDear diary\nI remember like it was yesterday\nIt was October 30\nI no longer have any need for these worldly things\nI wanna go where he is\nI'll follow the fire in the sky\nAnd like that I'll be gone\n\n[Chorus]\nYou took my heartbeat from me\nThis is the saddest story\nWhat was wrong with my love?\nYou took my heartbeat from me\nShould have just stabbed it for me\nFrom ashes to dust, I just wanna get along with you\n\n[Outro Chorus]\nYou took my heartbeat from me\nThis is the saddest story\nYou took my heartbeat from me\nShould have just stabbed it for me"}], "artist": "Kelis"}
