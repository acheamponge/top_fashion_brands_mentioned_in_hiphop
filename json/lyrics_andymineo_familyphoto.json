It's sad I gotta ask\nYou either cry or you try to learn to laugh\nLook, I figured I'd be past all this hurt by now\nBut after all this time it's only worse right now\n'Cause when you bury emotions, you bury them alive\nThey only come back stronger, somewhere later in your life\nAnd on the honeymoon, I got your text, but I ain't reply\nSaid \u201cCongratulations\u201d like, what a guy\nI ain't ask you to be perfect, man, that's only God\nI just wish you would have tried\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, everyone, everyone smile for the family photo\nBut everyone, everyone ain't really in the picture\nSo, everyone, everyone smile for the family photo\nBut everyone, everyone ain't really in the picture\n\n[Outro]\nGod, grant me the serenity\nTo accept the things that I cannot change\nCourage to change the things that I can\nAnd the wisdom to know the difference\nLiving one day at a time\nEnjoying one moment at a time\nAccepting hardships as the pathway to peace\nTaking, as Jesus did, this sinful world as it is\nNot as I would have it\nBut trusting that You will make all things right\nIf I surrender to Your Will\nSo that I may be reasonably happy in this life\nAnd supremely happy with You forever in the next\nAmen\nAmen, Amen\nAmen"}]}
