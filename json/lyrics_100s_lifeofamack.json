Tell 'em that you mess with me\nTell him that I'm next up, he need to come invest in me.\"\n\n[Hook]\nStraight makin' that money\nStraight makin' that money\nYoung playas gettin' raised out here\nAnd all the chicken-head bitches wanna braid my hair\nStraight takin' that money\nStraight takin' that money\nIt's all good, no sweat off my back\n\u2018Cause it's just another day in the life of a mack\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's almost 3, and I had her waitin' for nothin'\nSo now she cryin' and fussin'\nShe think I'm fuckin' her cousin\nI say, \"Hold up, can you prove that? Bitch, are you sure?\nThe last time I saw that bitch was back in 2004.\"\nShe was bad, you can't blame it on shit\nSince back when Freak-A-Leek was on the radio and shit\nIf I remember correctly, don't ever sweat me\nDon't think I won't turn your broken heart into confetti\nRound 6, got a call from an unknown\nMust've been some ancient bitches playin' up on my phone\nHit the store and got a bottle of rum\nThey gave it to me \u2018cause they knew me\nMotherfucker, I ain't 21\nHad to kill it, feelin' made right now\nThen went on a drunk mission to my main bitch' house\nGot some pussy, then I passed out\nWoke up and hit it again\n\u2018Cause she was sleepin' with her ass out\n\n[Hook]\nStraight makin' that money\nStraight makin' that money\nYoung playas gettin' raised out here\nAnd all the chicken-head bitches wanna braid my hair\nStraight takin' that money\nStraight takin' that money\nIt's all good, no sweat off my back\n\u2018Cause it's just another day in the life of a mack", "album": "Radio Los Santos [GTA V]", "title": "Life Of A Mack", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/574841ae35e0466ce41f8355845da79b.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "100s"}
