(Yeah, but I ain't worried about it tonight)\nHow long does famous last? (Blow all this cash, I might)\nHow long does famous last? (Tell them welcome to the good life)\nHow long does famous last?\nHow long does famous last?\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm addicted to this lifestyle\nNever going back to no basic shit\nWhen we on tour every night's wild\nThinking about the days we weren't making shit\nSpending everything just to make it back\nSaying everything never take it back\nSo if you don't fuck with me I'm okay with that\nI'm okay with that (okay with that)\nIn a black shirt and some faded jeans\nBeen around the world in these APC's\nWorking non stop trying to take the keys\nOff the lot next week spending 80 g's\nIntro my floor to your lady's knees\nAlways on tour cause I'm making cheese\nMichigan in February is 8 degrees\nAnd the fans waiting outside could maybe freeze\nYeah, smoking on killa\nNever going on unless your team is strong\nYeah, finally making skrilla\nEverywhere I go bring my team along\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYeah, now I'm almost famous\nStill right here with the oldest faces\nSwear I came up from the coldest places\nYoung man gets everything, he goes and chases\nAw man\n\n[Chorus]\nYoung with too much cash, watch how I came up fast\nThey say I'm next to get it\nThey bring your name up last\nAnd while I made it splash, rappers came and passed\nBut still I ask myself\nHow long does famous last? (Yeah, but I ain't worried about it tonight)\nHow long does famous last? (Blow all this cash, I might)\nHow long does famous last? (Tell them welcome to the good life)\nHow long does famous last?\nHow long does famous last?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm trying to marry Kate Upton\nBlow this money too quickly\nTo them squares who trying to hate: fuck them\nYou can't catch me, I move too swiftly\nI'm always going through customs\nWhen I leave I'm knowing you miss me\nWe run through bottles like nothin'\nLike I'm tryna drown in this whiskey\nIndulge in everything we wish\nWe drink it straight with no mixers\nGot bitch drinks if you squeamish\nAt the after parties, no pictures\nMy bag of trees looks greenish\nGot a bad bitch to roll swishers\nThis lifestyle's the sweetest\nMan I'm shining now just like fixtures\nYeah, do it for my city\nEverywhere I go bro, I rep the Bay\nYeah, tell you it's a pity\nBut hating fucks always got shit to say uh\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCause I'm almost famous\nStill right here with the oldest faces\nSwear I came up from the coldest places\nYoung man gets everything, he goes and chases\nAw man\n\n[Chorus]\nYoung with too much cash, watch how I came up fast\nThey say I'm next to get it\nThey bring your name up last\nAnd while I made it splash, rappers came and passed\nBut still I ask myself\nHow long does famous last? (Yeah, but I ain't worried about it tonight)\nHow long does famous last? (Blow all this cash, I might)\nHow long does famous last? (Tell them welcome to the good life)\nHow long does famous last?\nHow long does famous last?\n\n[Outro]\nHow long does famous last?\nHow long does famous last?\nHow long does famous last?\nHow long does famous last?\nHow long does famous last?\nHow long does famous last?"}]}
