Styles\n\n[Verse One: Styles]\nYou should take the cross off your neck and pray to Jesus\nI'm breakin' every rapper up like eighty pieces\nI done sat in the cell and stared at the wall\nAnd I'm swearin' to God I air all y'all\nI live by the sword or the pistols\nSummertime I'm outside with niggas with pitbulls\nI don't smoke the haze if it ain't got the crystals\nLook in my eyes you can tell I would lift you\nI'm in the DB nine when I'm comin' to get you\nI'm with my Arab man and he holdin' the missiles\nI'm sayin' fuck all y'all\nIf you don't understand let me make it real clear I'm sayin' what to all y'all\nNo more videos or them silly hoes ridin' on y'all dick when I cut all y'all\nThe game too pussy I think it need change\nI wanna see the barrel flame 'til they brains get mushy\nEast Coast Ghost\nAin't no other rapper in the game that you know that plays the streets so close\nStill bring pain\nFire more shots than y'all motherfuckers do in that Max Payne game\nAnybody front I'm knockin' 'em out D blockin' 'em out\nThat mean I'ma snatch his chain\n\n[Verse Two: Talib Kweli]\nAin't nobody fuckin' with Kweli\nAnd the rock with a real name like a Styles P\nRepresent the L.O.X\nBig up to all the massive rude boy on deck\nNiggas yellin' out what the blood clot, lick enough shots\nFinna bust a flow like buckshot\nWhat's up Franklin Avenue?\nThese Brooklyn niggas runnin' wild through the jungle like caribou\nRap immaculate\nI spit fire that will get tobacco lit faster than the rider on the chariot\nOld school and cooler than the river watered downstream\nHit the block hotter than them grits poured in Al Green\nThe cops flashin' the lights, passin' them bikes\nAsk for ya rights and they beat you like \u201cThe Passion Of Christ\u201d\nThey got a sicker fetish for violence than Mel Gibson\nWe inject it in our system through direct television\nThe way I'm spittin' Heaven through the Hell we living\nIt's like fate is a fakery style you can tell it's written\nIt's like a jail when you're sittin' in a cell or prison\nWith destiny comin' in the form of some mail or a visit\nYea opportunity's knockin'\nLike the beat, cuz I got Pete Rock and Beatminerz in my hemoglobin\nPremier Show and Diamond D\nListen here we about to flip it on the track like nine to three"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
