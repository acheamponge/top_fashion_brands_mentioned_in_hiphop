Feeling classy today. Well, alright. Let's go.)\nI'm not evil, I'm just psycho\nI'm so afraid that everybody looks at my lyrics to spot a typo\n(Yeah)\nMoney rate growing in my pocket, is the minimal\nRunning from the mobs of people, treat me like a criminal\nThe pinnacle of raw entertainment, my day spent\nThrowing rocks at main events\nI unravel the havoc\nAnd take it easy in the hammock\nAl Qaeda is the testimony\nDon't you ever rectify me\nThe kill-able syllables\nIn the pinnacle of innocence\nI'm a creepy little rapper coming out the factory, capture me\nI will be the toughest rapper, actually\nWatch me as I drag my ass to the top gradually\n(Ugh)\nI never sleep\nI stay awake and prey on the weak\nThen I devour the freaks\nAnd then I pray for the weak\nI transmit gamma rays\nAnd break off the manta ray's tail\nAnd raise hell on a Saturday\nAnd stab the people\nYeah, another rapper washing the dishes\nDon't look at me and my sick compositions\n(OH SICK!)\n\n[Outro]\nI am done with this feeling\nI am done with this feeling\nAll you suckers this evening\nAll you suckers this evening\nAre going down\n(WHOOOOO)", "year": "2012-12-06"}]}
