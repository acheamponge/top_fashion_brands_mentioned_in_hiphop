Bring me in\n(2-3)\n\n[Verse 1]\nHey, hot damn, ho, here I go again\nYou know who I be, and you know watcha in for\nFor your information\nMe, I be coming harder than ejaculation\nEvacuation on the premesis (I'm what?), I'm limitless\nRun it to the limit, like Emmett Smith, I'm listed in the Guinness's\nFor in the book of Genesis it reads\nIn the beginning God created Heaven then he created me\nSo you see\nIt ain't no way on earth you can see me\nThat's just how it B.E\nYou might as well drop that thought, cause it ain't goin down, G\nYou wishin, I'll leave you curled up in the fetal position\nImpossible mission you think you gettin with Rage, well, then listen\nYou're thinkin the unthinkable\nRage is the unsinkable\nWho can do it better\nI gotta art for linkin letters\nA diva run it like Gail Devers\nStyle so sick you think I got swamp fever\nTo all non-believers\nY'all ain't believin I rocks hard when I'm stoned like Steven\nThe way I kill it I leave you in a process of grieven\nLeave you barely breathin\nKicks it so hard I knock out your teeth and leave you teethin\nTake aim and shoot, knock you out your boots\nI be the beginning of a New Testament like Matthew, Mark, and Luke\nI turn the mutha out in Levi Strauss\nNo doubt, make suckas do an about\nFace, cut to the chase\nThey told me haste makes waste\nAnd I'll waste you if you're hasty\nLyrically, it don't take much to make me\nFly off the handle\nGo off like Roman candles\nScandalous not\nBand you like wristwratch\nWatch me clock a end, clock a grip\nWatch me grip that microphone and cold rock that bitch\nTo your socks get hit\nFrom the esophogus my vocal range will expand\nAnd raise up and smack that ass like back hands\nI got that shit that leave your whole section deaded\nAnd, if you got no common sense you won't be ressurected\nFed-Ex it, my successes didn't make it over night\nBut over mics for you it could be over in just one night\nCause the R hits like Thundarr the Barbarian\nNeva in your life could you ever scar the Aquarian\nWater Bearer\nGreat Granddaughter of Clara\nBring the terror to your dome\nAs you get nearer to my throne\nThem bones get crushed to dust\nCause when it comes down to struttin my stuff\nIt's necessary\nI get rough\nCause I'm a lyrical genius no other could swing this\nBetter than I (Why?) cause I'm one of the meanest\nNot givin a damn statin to all who I am\nNo need to cram, cause now you fully understand\nThat Robin is rockin, causin hippers to hoppin\nTry to stop what I'm droppin, and a box you'll be popped in\nThink twice, save your life, give me the mic\nI say it again, yo, it won't be nice\nYou think I'm huffin and puffin, think I'm blowin and bluffin\nYou hens can't begin to contend with Robin\nVoice smooth, lyrics lovely\nThe hippest hip-hopper, got brothers tuggin to hug me\nAh, dig\n\n[Outro: Spoken]\nAight, damn, aight, that's enough. You got a level now?\nI'm shook cause I'm gonna be hoarse in a minute, come on\nLet's, let's do the song, the song, okay\nPremier, DJ Premier, Pr-Pr-Pr-Pre-mier\nPremi-Pr-Pr-Pr-Pr Wait, no, no, no, no, no, okay, okay\nGo back, go back, go back"}], "artist": "The Lady of Rage"}
