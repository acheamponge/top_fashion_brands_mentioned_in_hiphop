I gotta get it\nAnd the doubters that tell me no, no they can't stop the vision\nAnd put a sock in it, and stuff it down their esophagus\nSwallow it until your screaming out, yeah like you was with us\nIntolerant of critics\nYou weren't putting in the work, you wouldn't get it, admit it\nImagine if you were spitting fire like a dragon or as fly as Aladdin\nBut everytime that you rapping, they say you're wack man\nThat's why they can't stand me, I do it for family\nRemember my haters, when I\u2019m winning the Grammy\n\n[Chorus]\nSee I\u2019ma make it, that's a guarantee\nSee me flying in the crowds, world, look at me\nWorld look at me\nWorld look at me\nWhoever said sky\u2019s the limit is an underachiever\nNow we're flying off to Venus, without the Serena\nWithout the Serena\nWithout the\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn these songs, I put my heart and my soul\nIt all start with a goal, I got the sharpest of flows\nIncrease your interest in music, it's worth listening to it\nAnd Nas is my biggest influence\nMaking rigorous music\nTryna bring rap back to it's regular days\nIt\u2019s never the same, since the '90's, it's changed\nFor better or for worse, forever, I'm cursed\nWith this gift to write rhymes without effort or work\nReading a veteran verse\nBut you just gotta put the work in or you're just worthless\nAnd you gotta have the courage to spit the verses\nAnd it also take perseverance\nAnd when they say it isn't worth the hearing, it just hurt the spirit\n\n[Chorus]\nSee I'ma make it, that's a guarantee\nSee me flying in the crowds, world, look at me\nWorld look at me\nWorld look at me\nWhoever said sky's the limit is an underachiever\nNow we're flying off to Venus, without the Serena\nWithout the Serena\nWithout the\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf Martin Luther had a dream, then I'ma spark the vision\nAnd you could understand more, if you start to listen\nWell that's a smart decision\nNo need to start a lecture\nThey say your rhymes are foreign, preface this like architecture\nOthers say I suck, like are you serious\nMr. Psycho flows, I'm better than you period\nAre you delirious, curious, how he get this good\nWell you can have some more rhymes, now I wish you would\nAnd it's amazing how he switch his flow and style up\nNow hopefully, he haters don't let the money pile up\nThey can't fit and make the Nile flood\nAnd before, we make the crowd nuts but\n\n[Chorus]\nSee I'ma make it, that's a guarantee\nSee me flying in the crowds, world, look at me\nWorld look at me\nWorld look at me\nWhoever said sky's the limit is an underachiever\nNow we're flying off to Venus, without the Serena\nWithout the Serena\nWithout the", "title": "World Look At Me"}]}
