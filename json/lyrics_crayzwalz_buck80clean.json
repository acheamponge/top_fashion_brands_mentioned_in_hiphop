Right here.  What you spit?  Light years\nI'm fresh like a new pair of white Airs\nStay crazy, blaze daily, save babies, raise ladies\nBuck 50.  Keep the change\u2014here's a buck 80\n\n[Hook 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nYo, where you at?  Right here.  What you spit?  Light years\nI'm fresh (Fresh, fresh)\nStay crazy, blaze daily, save babies, raise ladies\nBuck 50.  Keep the change\u2014here's a buck 80\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nChicks dig how I spit it\u2014ladies love the phlegm\nI don't ball with none of y'all\u2014I'm still above the rims\nAnd the roundhouse kicks had the streets hugging these jims\nDrop jewels\u2014even fools be loving the gems\nLet's get it on and popping and keep it activated\nI hope you need advance speaking on any plans rap-related\nI body my verses, rip the beat, shape it, press rewind\nSlay it, say it, get me reincarnated\nLike retards getting pussy, I dumb in the cut\nYou wake up in jail cells with a thumb in your butt\nYou ain't a thug.  I run the club with rum in the cup\nReady to rush your DJ just to make your music jump (Punk)\nThat's why I go to clubs with, like, ten themes.  And the white mens\nI run with can't jump \u2018cause they own the team\nAnd if you ain't Kim, it seems you don't know me\nI spit 16s in your face like twin Kobes\n\n[Hook 1: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nYo, where you at?  Right here.  What you spit?  Light years\nI'm fresh like a new pair of white Airs\nStay crazy, blaze daily, save babies, raise ladies\nBuck 50.  Keep the change\u2014here's a buck 80\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nChances get slim like thin Dobers that shapeshift\nTo Snoop and rep \u201cGin and Juice\u201d like BET and my Chi homie\nWho's fucking with this?  Have you ducking the hits\nLeave you stuck in a desert with a bucket of piss (Bitch)\nSit in the passenger seat while I'm crashing your Jeep\nHot potato was the only way you herbs was passing the heat (Come on, son)\nYou a mangina and a prom queener (Fake)\nWho learned how to thug from fads in Don Diva\nThis is that Hell Rell shit that spell well, kid\nI snuff buildings if I want to sell bricks\nDeal with thick nicks\u2014no time for fine dimes\nMy lines got B.I.G. potential like I write for Shyne\nAnd I'm master of the cypher, Lord of the Rings\nAnd my third eye blings like The Scorpion King\nAnd that's exactly what sound funny, see?\n\u2018Cause next time I rap/wrap, it'll be on the soundtrack for Mummy 3\n\n[Hook 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nYo, where you at?  Right here.  What you spit?  Light years\nI'm fresh like a new pair of white Airs\nStay crazy, blaze daily, save babies, raise ladies\nBuck 50.

Light years\nI'm fresh (Fresh, fresh)\nStay crazy, blaze daily, save babies, raise ladies\nBuck 50.  Keep the change\u2014here's a buck 80\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nThe game's painstaking (So?).  I remain ancient (Flow)\nFlames could have your dame dancing naked on poles in train stations\nCats'll push your button, mush your wifey button\nNever mind your business\u2014divine intervention's when you butt in\nI don't spit no more.  I circle with Afghanis\nQuick to give you barb wire thongs for your granny panties\nYou bitch-made, couldn't stab a track with a switchblade\nAfter you dictate, tell me how my dick taste\nPut 7 in your chest if you owe them / Odom checks\nAnd I ain't talking 'bout the Clippers\u2014leave your jersey a mess\nI'm a veteran\u2014respect me.  My basic spit\nMake these young players better like Jason Kidd\nAnd if I'm getting paper, it's \u2018cause I'm ripping flavor\nI'm nice around the mic/Mike like the Wizard players\nSpit a verse that deserve a replay.  Get on\nSome humble shit like, \u201cYo, give it up for the DJ!\u201d\n\n[Hook 1: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nYo, where you at?  Right here.  What you spit?  Light years\nI'm fresh like a new pair of white Airs\nStay crazy, blaze daily, save babies, raise ladies\nBuck 50.  Keep the change\u2014here's a buck 80"}]}
