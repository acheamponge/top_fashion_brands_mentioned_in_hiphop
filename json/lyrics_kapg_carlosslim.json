A lot\nI don't really say too much like Kawhi\nMarried to money, we husband and wife\nDerivative gang, no its KapFe for life\n\n(Verse 1)\nPatek, two-tone, y'all still walking like the Flintstones\nI rock Rick Owens, blue hunnids like I'm Rick Ross\nHad to go get it, I ain't never had a big homie\nKapFe la familia, they're my brothers, just like Nick Jonas\nI get my looks from my pops\nKeep it on me, gotta watch out for opps\nGotta stash shit away, gotta watch out for cops\nRemember we was rocking mints with the rocks\nGot your bitch, she give me sloppy toppy\nStacking bucks like from Milwaukee\nLook at all this water like it's Abu Dhabi\nDiamonds on my neck and they rocking, rocking\n\n(Pre-Chorus)\nHow much I just spend?\nI just made 20 on the whole ?\nHellcat, I went tint\nMade myself one rich Mexican\nPockets full of lint\nI was tryna round me up some M's\nShe said \"Can I quit?\"\nTold her that we better off as friends (yeah)\n\n(Chorus)\nI smoke a hole out my socks\nI hit the O then I jive\nGo get the bankroll then I shine\nGo get, why would I not?\nWhatchu make on that road?
