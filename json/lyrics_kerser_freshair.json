Talkin' bout the rainbows\nHow they writing really dope they softer then some play dough\nThat\u2019s why I watch you rap, to my crew it's a laughing stock\nYou think this shit is fake I fuckin' beg your pardon gronk\nWhat happened to the love? Guess is slowly changed to hate\nWhile I made it out the rut, now it\u2019s time to grab my mates\nWill we live to see a better day? I suppose you never know\nMy worst mistake was lettin' people know that I be getting dough\nI just had to brag, 'cause I fuckin' proved them wrong\nYou feel the goose bumps risin', you ain't never heard a truer song\nYou want a piece of puddin' but I spat in the cake\nYou see real when you look at me like the tats on my face\nAnd then everyone's sketchin' over metal detectors\nGot em dacked, its my show so they let em in, get ya\nBack to the facts that we livin' it raw\nMiddle fingers to the haters this beginnin' of more\nMore raps, more shows, more tracks, more dough\nMore cash, more flows, more hash, more smoke\nI\u2019m sticking to the music, you just me do my thing\nIf its win or loose, you fucking had to knew I win\nNow I\u2019m moving in to grounds they said I'd never touch\nThey ask me how to make it, I just say its effort bruz\nThere\u2019s something real about me, separates me from the others\nHalf our shows on stage I swear to god we spot the under-covers\nI throw my finger up then I pump Unwritten Letter\nKinda crazy every song that I be getting better\nThe new albums coming so so fat\nPicture that if this shit was just a promo track\nIt's Kers One\n\n[Outro]\nYeah\nMe and Nebs have that album locked\nSo you gotta wait for that shit\nOctober twenty-fifth\nThat's the new shit\nThat's when shit gets rearranged and restructured again\nYeah, we out"}], "artist": "Kerser"}
