We trained to buss\nYou can run dog, that's what this laser for\nI think I need to, take a breather\nCause I'm hot as fever\nI'm about to bring some type of demon\nRight up outta me\nCause I been feelin' like you pussy niggas tryna plot on me\nThat's why I keep this Glock on me\nPlus I got all this guap on me\nBut way before the flex you still could catch me\nOn that block out east\nLost my homies, now I feel like God just dropped a rock on me\nBut I won't stop, I can't stop\nGotta go hard, till my rate drop\nSpittin' all this fire make my face hot\nNow I can't wait till my tape drop\nAnd I'm still up on the 8 Block\nLate night me and J. Dot\nBetter think twice for you ride past\nLet the 9 blast now the Jakes hot\nI was bout to take a rest but\nSmoke told me, \"Bro it ain't no let ups\"\nSo I'm working hard like I'm in the pros\nMake a nigga bitch lick my sweat up\nShe suckin' dick and I just met her\nShe know a nigga next up\nShe hope I don't neglect her\nAnd she know I don't respect her\nAnd I might forget my sweater\nBut never leave the house without Berettas\nStill the same nigga from the gangway\nTryna flip a ounce into a Phantom\nCatch me doing shows filling stands up\nYou know the gang turn the fans up\nAnd you know we got them cans tucked\nHope nobody don't get blammed up\nI be leanin' I can't stand up\nAnd this bitch asked me why my jeans sag\nCause they tryna hold my bands up\nHeard somebody wanna rob me\nWell you bett' not give ya chance up\n2 seats in the 50 shot\nI just hope I don't get jammed up\nAnd this 50 bett' not jam up\nI seen niggas get in jams and\nThey ain't even stay to pick they mans up\nI seen niggas shakin' hands\nThen make the same niggas put they hands up\nI seen niggas change and changed\nNiggas that was cool since the sandbox\nSo I gotta keep my head up\n16 and I got one head up\nAnd ion talk, I let the gun talk\nAnd she don't never really understand nothin'\nLet a fuck nigga ask somethin'\nGive a fuck nigga every one\nGave my young niggas couple .38s\nAnd some shells let em have fun\nYoung niggas spend a lot of cash\nCause growing up I never had none\nI'm like, \"Oh I gotta get me some\"\nCause being broke wasn't any fun\nWe got choppers for everyone\nWho want problems with anyone\nI be tired of tryna tell y'all niggas\nWhere a nigga really comin' from\nAnd why a nigga gotta go hard\nCause ion really come from nothin'\nAnd I never been a runner up\nCause it ain't nobody runnin' us\nAnd Lil Mally got that sit em down\nIf somebody ever runnin' up\nImma always bond them killas out\nWhat'chu think I got them hunnids for?\nCrazy James just knocked his sentence out\nYeah the state done let a menace out\nSo I'm showing up at my nigga house\nLike the cop that move the tenants out\nI see lil niggas want some Twitter clout\nBut I ain't tryna put ya business out"}]}
