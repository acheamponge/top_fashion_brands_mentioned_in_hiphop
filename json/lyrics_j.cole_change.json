Cole]\nMy intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah\nMy intuition is telling me there'll be better days\nI like this tone\n\n[Verse 1: J. Cole]\nYeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days\nI sit in silence and find whenever I meditate\nMy fears alleviate, my tears evaporate\nMy faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date\nBut see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath\nBringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step\nAs we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die\nMost niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified\nIt's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell\nAsking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)\nAs if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail\nSee I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man\nBecause He knows us all and therefore He would understand\nThe ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life\nThe bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife\n\n[Chorus: J. Cole]\nI know you desperate for a change let the pen glide\nBut the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)\nBut the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)\nBut the only real change come from\u2014\nIn cemeteries or in chains I see men cry\nBut the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)\nBut the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)\nBut the only real change come from\u2014\n\n[Verse 2: J. Cole]\nYeah, my chosen religion\nJesus piece frozen from sinnin'\nDoin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions\nTo see a million 'fore I see a casket\nI got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard\nI'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste\nWhen I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates\nNiggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank\nKnow I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo\nRight now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility\nFor my ability to make them birds fly\nFiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view\nAnd who am I to tell a nigga what to do?\nI just supply, it's economics\nMy business ain't got the suit and tie\nKeep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine\nI can't oblige, dog, I work too hard\nSo reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga\n\n[Chorus: J. Cole]\nI know you desperate for a change let the pen glide\nBut the only real change come from inside\nBut the only real change come from inside\nBut the only real change come from\u2014\nIn cemeteries or in chains I see men cry\nBut the only real change come from inside\nBut the only real change come from inside\nBut the only real change come from\u2014\n\n[Verse 3: J. Cole]\nYeah, prodigal son, got a new gun\nThis one don't run out of ammo\nLately been working on my handles\nCan I ball, become a star and remain my self?\nIf I fall, dust it off and regain my self\nFuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt\nI'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved\nI no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing\n\n[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]\nLife is all about the evolution\nI give up, I give in, I move back a little\nI live up, I look up, now I'm back for more\nYou can dream but don't neglect the execution\nI give up, I give in, I move back a little\nI live up, I look up, now I'm back for more\nTime is short that's what somebody told me\nI give up, I give in, I move back a little\nI live up, I look up, now I'm back for more\nToo short to keep following your homies\nI give up, I give in, I move back a little\nI live up, I look up, now I'm back for more\n\n[Bridge: J. Cole]\nI reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands\nAll of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram\nFinger on trigger make a little nigga understand\nWhat it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man\nEyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels\nNiggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills\nBloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield\nI call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)\nThat's how you feel?\n\n[Verse 4: J. Cole]\nPistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat\nScattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete\nA body laid on the concrete\nLook, somebody laid on the concrete\nNo time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too\nI made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news\nOvercame with a feeling I can't explain\nCause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22\n(Last night at around...) He was 22\n(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)\n\n[Outro: J. Cole]\n(I swear to God, bruh)\nWe're gathered here today...\n(I swear to God)\nTo mourn the life of James McMillan Jr\n(I swear to God\u2014nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)\nA tragedy, another tragedy in the black community\n(I promise you, bro...)\nWe got to do better, people\n22 years old, this boy was too young\n(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)\nOur condolences go to his family, our prayers\n(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)\nWe know he's in a better place\nWe know he's in a better place\nBut this has got to end, ladies and gentleman\nWe've got to come together, this is\u2014this is beyond words\nNow I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from\u2014"}], "artist": "J.
