(Haa!)\n\n[Hook: Swaati]\nI was born this\nI was I was I was born this way\nI was born this\nI was I was I was born this way\n\n[Verse 2: Feyago]\nI used to be a real dick back in high school\nGetting high getting by me and my crew\nWhen you\u2019re small, you think you know it all\nTill you fall, you hit the ground, break into a million pieces\nTime teaches I just never chose to listen\nCould\u2019ve built a home instead I built a prison\nAll it took was a bunch of lies and some bad decisions\nNow I'm trying to make redemption my sole mission\nI mean I try but sometimes I don\u2019t recognize\nThink I'm going through a quarter life crisis\nI have a choice but I never do the right thing\nMy friends laugh, but they never criticize me\nLife is a love song, you get to pick your words\nLife is a canvas, you get to pick your colours\nLife is a compromise, you need to think of others\nLife is war zone, you get to pick your brothers\nGrowing up all the people that I took for granted\nI used big words, But I was empty handed\nOne day I went for branded, that's when my ego landed\nI did whatever the present situation demanded\nBut today is brand new day\nAnd I really wanna be the man you crave\nAnd I think I'm don with the zombie phase\nI was on replay, I was born this way\n\n[Hook: Swaati]\nI was born this\nI was I was I was born this way\nI was born this\nI was I was I was born this way\n\n[Verse 3: Pardhaan]\nBewkoof lagbhag sabhi yahan\nSudhar jaayenge arre abhi kahaan\nBhaed chaal karein yeh gidado ka jhund\nPraleh ke baad hi theek hoga yeh jahaan\nMeri chinta ka vishya yeh dimagh hai\nKhud kare toh theek koi aur kare to gunah hai\nLaalchi sab ehsaan faraamosh\nMujhe imandari ki dete sallah hain\nPhir bhi maine inhey maaf kar diya\nInsaniyat ki wajah se insaaf kar diya\nPar yeh toh suer hain hagenge khaaenge wahi\nInho ne mera mann kharaab kar diya\nTauba kar beitha in sab ke saath se\nAb shayar hoon dosti hai sirf raat se\nHey ram inhe saamnein na lana mere\nKahin koi khoon ho jaaye na mere haath se\n\n[Hook: Swaati]\nI was born this\nI was I was I was born this way\nI was born this\nI was I was I was born this way", "title": "Born This Way", "year": "2017-08-01", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6a2a840dc6d2ea1a2999899d1ccba844.630x630x1.jpg"}]}
