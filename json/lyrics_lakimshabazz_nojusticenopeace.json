No, I'm geased\nWithout no justice there'll be no peace\n\nNo justice\nThere will never be...\nNo peace\nWithout...\nNo justice\nThere will never be...\nNo peace\n\nSee, I'm a programmed warrior, built to last\nA Five Percenter who descends from the Lost Tribe of Shabazz\nBarin the truth, I'm not scared of ya\nIs this the United States or the United Snakes of America?\nThis is a livin hell and I'm not ( ? )\nI refuse to burn in America's melting pot\nI'm angry, you can't refrain me, I make em all see\nWord is bond it was wrong how they did [Name]\nAs far as I can see her privacy was exploited\nThey beat her and raped her, put her in the back of manure\nEngraved 'nigga' on the stomach\nUp to this day a lot of people think she fronted\nIs it a lie or is it incidental?\nPeople who are raped names' supposed to be kept confidential\nBut she was exploited at a young age, it's such a shame\nI never heard the Central Park jogger's name\nBut straight to the point and on the ball\nI be the universal true Son of Man and and a ( ? )\nI pity you idiots like Arsenio Hall\nJokes about our sister, he thinks it's funny, y'all\nIt's sad to see ( ? ) so much as a minor\nI'm glad to see the Nation of Sslam refined her\nYou want peace, well, let the unjust stuff cease\nIf we don't have justice, there will be no peace\n\nNo justice\nThere will never be...\nNo peace\nWithout...\nNo justice\nThere will never be...\nNo peace\n\nBreak it down\n\n(I think that the solution rests with the people\nIt's a mistake to rely on professors\nRacism is learned\nNobody is born a racist\nAnd some people have Ph.D.'s in racism)\n\nThe Mighty Maestro created a beat that was lethal\nThe source to bring forth power to the people\nThe rhythm was made to be rolled by the host\nSo I'ma ride the rhythm from New York to the West Coast\nBrotherman takin a stand, demandin respect\nI'm not with the situation in Teaneck\nThey said he was dangerous, well, I'm concerned\nHow could he be so dangerous with his back turned?\nThey said, \"Freeze!
