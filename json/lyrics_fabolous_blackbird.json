Hey doll, it's me\nNever lockouts when you play ball with me\nAnd it's consequences but she understands\nThat she riding with a wanted man\n\n[Hook: Broadway]\nI don't care about what they gon' say\nYou already what they gon' play\nYou my black bird, that ain't gon' change\nI need you to spread your wings\nTo fly away with me, baby\nThat's my black bird\nI need you to fly away with me, baby\nThat's my black bird\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe at the safe house, hiding out\nCause all eyes be on us when we sliding out\nWhat if we could get out of here altogether?\nDon't pack no bags when we land, hit the mall, whatever\nYou and me now, no more what you call a job\nGotta take what you want in life, some people call it rob\nI get to the money, minute forty seconds flat\nIt ain't hard to tell, so we expecting rats\nBut it's me and you against the world\nFeel like the odds is in our favor\nThe smart money's on my baby girl\nWhen others fear, we are at our bravest\nBack at it not a hour later\nIt must suck being our neighbors\nAnd it's consequences, but she understands\nThat she riding with a wanted man\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Black Bird"}]}
