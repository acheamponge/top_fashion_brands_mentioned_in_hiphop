Cause I be workin' and workin'\nAll these heads I be turnin', they on my body like surgeons\nI think they see my conversion\nThat's why they be lurkin', but their feelings be hurtin'\nOr remember when I wanna dance at certain clubs\nAnd they told me, \"No, no, that's a dub\"\nNow they the same niggas blowin' up my phone\nWantin' me to host, oh word? That's a dub\nBands\n\n[Hook]\nI think I like that\n(I know, I know they're mad now)\nI think I like that\nI think I like that\n(Hurtin' my feelings)\nI think I like that\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen I come up in the building I initiate\nI'm the reason why the fuckers gotta renovate\nI'm eatin' good and they mad they can't get a plate\nNever thought we'd be gettin' booked in different states\nBefore the century they didn't even look this way\nNow they wanna eat my ass like a skirt steak\nGot 'em sending gifts, it's not even my birthday\nYou niggas soft and I meant that in the worst way\nOh you bitches suckin' dick just to get a bag\nYou hustlin'-backwards ass bitch, you're doin' bad\nIt's pretty sad, you should be getting more than that\nSuck a dick so you can pay your rent, couple months with that\nI mention flow, keep it on the low, I tell you facts\nWhen a nigga 'bout to cum, just throw it back\nIt's over, you won, that nigga trapped\nAnd that bank account, girl? Empty that"}]}
