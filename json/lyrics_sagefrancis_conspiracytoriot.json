Well don't agonize\nSmoke 'em if you got 'em, a whole pack of lies\nSummer spring and autumn, now bring the wintertime\nI don't protest with snow, I shovel it with picket signs\n(psst psst conspiracy to riot)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nWe have the right to assembly and it's the duty of the patriot\nTo protect his country from the government\nBut when we try it, but when we try it but when we try it (conspiracy to riot)\nPeace rally with my friends (conspiracy to riot)\nWhen we have no defense (conspiracy to riot)\nRubber bullets to the heads (conspiracy to riot x3)\nWhen we find voter fraud (conspiracy to riot)\nWhen we defy overlords (conspiracy to riot)\nWhen we finally pull the cord (conspiracy to riot x3)\nTil the truth is revealed (conspiracy to riot)\nWe ain't choosing to kneel (conspiracy to riot)\nLet me be the human shield (conspiracy to riot)", "album": "Sick Of Wasting"}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
