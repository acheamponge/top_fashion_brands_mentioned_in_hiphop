I'm my personal shrink\nThrow my heart down on the ground, stomp it, use the blood for the ink\nI'm used to purple and pink bruises so thanks for the tools\nThat's just a brick from the mansion\nAnother stitch in the pants of a Johnny Cash\n\n[Hook]\nJohnny Cash\nJohnny Cash\nJohnny Cash\nJohnny Cash\nJohnny Cash", "title": "Johnny Cash"}]}
