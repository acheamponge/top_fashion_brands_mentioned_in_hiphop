Feed her rum and raisin ice cream\nShower her with diamond rings and money\n23 hours a day I study\nDreaming about beautiful women, I hate you gay Teletubbies\nDreams keep me alive you can't take them from me\nThe battlefield is bloody, mean and ugly\nMy adrenaline rushes when the enemy rush me\nTrying to bust me cos I swore I'd defend my country\nIf I could choose between being lucky and having money\nNothing negative could ever touch me\nWhat must be is ultimately not up to me\nBut I sacrifice my life for yours if you trust me\nPin my medals upon my chest\nSo I can left-right-left into certain death\nGodspeed and God bless\nIn the end I hope God is impressed if I'm put to rest\nI did what I came to do, no time left\nSay my name out the blue cos I rhyme it the best\nMicClub.net see me live in the flesh\nYou could come and download every rhyme that I spit\nYou could pay homage to Rip for one dollar a clip\nNone of those rhymes are on the album, bitch\nIt's a storage facility where I keep my shit\nFor the students in the class that wanna peep my shit\nBreak a bootlegger leg if he leak my shit\nYou don't wanna sign in bitch then eat my shit\nDrink my piss, you could never compete like this\nI'mma give you an example how deep I get\nTechnology not available for purchase\nMy brains collects, stores and converts million bar verses\nAt a stand-off distance of a thousand feet\nI illuminate the target and pound em to sleep\nTo within one micro-inch if you out in the street\nI could close my ears and still move my mouth to the beat\nDial-up to your network and make your files delete\nCount to three, listen to your browser beat\nToo late, foot already stepped in the feces\nDr. Norton's too sick to help your PCs\nVirtually I make your virtual memory freeze\nWith a Weapon of Mass Destruction - WMD\nI'm a TMC - Trouble to MCs\nDestroy colonies with UCAVs\nI send in no less than twenty A-Teams\nWipe you out before I even get to the beach\nWith my Transatmospheric spcae based mirrors\nCan you write that out without typographical error?\nDumb fucks I'm the best ever whatever\nDivide 18 by 6 you get the third letter\nFrom the lowest earth orbit up to the heavens\nI bomb y'all with lyrics of flesh shredders and petters forever\nAs a spitter I'm still tougher than leather\nI had to go underground to get over the pressure\nBattle rap from the Renaissance multi-megawatt\nBury you beneath the bedrock on the bed of rocks\nI could never get bored\nI write about Huxley vs Wilberforce, fuck writing killer chorus\nCopenhagen curriculum of metaphors\nEverything from Bob Marley to Tenor Saul\nThe System of A Down song number 14\nI see 'Aerials in the Sky' when I dream\nThe end is near I wish it would hurry up\nI feel nanobacteria burning me up\nBefore I explain in detail\nYou should examine the Mahr's mineral samples under my nails\nSometimes I wonder who's listening\nThe auditory Pavlovian conditioning's so sickening\nMy adenine, guanine, cytosine\nAnd thymine is really what makes my rhyme supreme\nSoon as I hear the beat, bada-bing\nYou gotta think: a hundred bars...damn, that's a lotta ink\nEventually all of my albums will be out of print\nThere'll be a clone for every style I invent\nFor every line I rhyme intense\nFor all the time I spent, every word I spit since 96\nIf you could input at a hundred\nI could output way above it, if we in public, I double it\nPut this on your study list and go study, bitch\nBasically quoting Hammer \"U can't Touch This\"\nI'm too assertive and alert for what its worth\nMy best piece of work is still yearning to be birthed\nClass Dismissed\nCenior Studies from Canibus\n\n[Outro (Recording of an author)]\nThere is something mystical, but it's not RARE\nAnd nobody should treat it as though this is something special\nThat writers do... anybody--anybody born physically able in the brain\nCan sit down and begin to write something and discover\nThat there are depths in her soul or his soul that are untapped"}]}
