{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1; Jay-Z]\nGeah, yeah\nLife is but a dream to me, I don't wanna wake up\nThirty odd years without having my cake up\nSo I'm about my paper 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year\nI don't know why we here\nSince we gotta be here life is but a beach ch-ch-ch-chair\nWent from having shabby clothes, crossing over Abbey Road\nHear my angels singing to me (are you happy, Hov'?)\nI just hope I'm hearing right; karma's got me fearing life\nColleek, are you praying for me?\nSee I got demons in my past, so I got daughters on the way\nIf the prophecy's correct, then the child should have to pay\nFor the sins of a father\nSo I barter my tomorrows against my yesterdays\nIn hopes that she'll be okay\nAnd when I'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare\nI'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter and a new beach chair\n\n[Chorus: Chris Martin]\nI hear my angels sing...\nLife is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up\n(I hear my angels sing)\nLife is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave\n(I hear my angels sing)\nLife is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up\n(I hear my angels sing)\nLife is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nLife is but a dream to me\nGun shots sing to these other guys\nBut lullabies don't mean a thing to me\nI'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of not trying\nEvery day hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian\nI don't surf the net, no, I never been on MySpace\nToo busy letting my voice vibrate\nCarving out my space in this world of fly girls\nCut-throats and diamond-cut ropes I twirls\nBenzes round corners where the sun don't shine\nI let the wheels give a glimpse of hope of one's grind\nSome said: \"Hov', how you get so fly?\"\nI said: \"From not being afraid to fall out the sky\"\nMy physical's a shell so when I say farewell\nMy soul will find an even higher plane to dwell\nSo have no fear, just know that\nLife is but a beach chair\n\n[Chorus: Chris Martin & Jay-Z]\nI hear my angels sing...\nLife is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up\n(I hear my angels sing)\nLife is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave\nLife is but a dream\n(I hear my angels sing)\nLife is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up\n(I hear my angels sing)\nLife is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave\nLife is but a dream\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nLife is but a dream\nCan't mimic my life, I'm the thinnest cut slice\nIntercut, the winner's cup\nWith winters rough enough to interrupt life\nThat's why I'm both saint and sinner, nice\nThis is Jay everyday, no compromise\nNo compass comes with this life just eyes\nSo to map it out you must look inside\nSure books can guide you but your heart defines you, chica\nYour coraz\u00f3n is what brought us home\nIn great shape like Heidi Klum, Maric\u00f3n, I am on\nPermanent vacay, life is but a beach chair\nThis song is like a Hallmark card until you reach here\nSo 'til she's here, and she's declared\nThe heir, I will prepare\nA blueprint for you to print\nA map for you to get back\nA guide for your eyes, and so you won't lose scent\nI'll make a stink for you to think\nI ink these verses full of prose\nSo you won't get conned out of two cent\nMy last will and testament I leave my heir\nMy share of Roc-A-Fella Records and a shiny new beach chair\n\n[Chorus: Chris Martin & Jay-Z]\nI hear my angels sing...\nLife is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up\n(I hear my angels sing)\nLife is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave\nLife is but a dream\n(I hear my angels sing)\nLife is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up\n(I hear my angels sing)\nLife is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave\nLife is but a dream\nI hear my angels sing...\nLife is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up\n(I hear my angels sing)\nLife is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave\nLife is but a dream\n(I hear my angels sing)\nLife is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up\n(I hear my angels sing)\nLife is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave\nLife is but a dream\n\n[Outro: Chris Martin]\nI hear my angels sing\nI hear my angels sing\nI hear my angels sing", "title": "Beach Chair", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4371d45b1c52d7dc87e4204ae0aa8373.900x900x1.jpg", "year": "2006-11-21", "album": "Kingdom Come"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
