"lyrics": "[Intro: Cam'ron]\nKilla, Psycho Drama, Twista\nChi-Town to Harlem, what's really good?\n\n[Break: Yung Buk of Psycho Drama and Twista]\nPart 2, what happens, when you combine the darkness, with the light?\n\n[Verse 1: Yung Buk of Psycho Drama (Cam'ron)]\nYeah, I am more than compelled and honored to expel\nThis hell that's inside of my shell for fuckers who want it\nViolence, yeah that bullshit right up my alley\nChasing you right up the alley\nWith a gun fixin' to kill you cause I feel you was the one\nFuckin' with my family (Psycho Drama)\nI roll with a gang of go-getters, and them ghouls and them gorillas\nWho be quick to put the Glock\nOr the gauge to the gut of one of your niggas and pull it\n(Psycho Drama)\nThe trigga and deliver you niggas these rigorous bullets\nIt's so rivetin' to see you livin' in vengeance sit up\nAnd shrivel to pudding\nFuckin with niggas you shouldn't\nThese menaces and villains and hoodlums\nThat'll give you the business\nAnd in an instant be diminishin' whoopin'\n'Cause it ain't no type of jokin' or jivin' comin' off of this\nYou done somersaulted and dived in a coffin of shit\nSo if you ever get the notion to just motion forward\nAnd get on some hoe shit\nYou niggas remember that I got that potion\nTo bore your brain in a bag\nAnd give you a new perspective on who the realest y'all\n(Psycho Drama) you just can't kill one you stupid bitch\nYou got to kill us all..\n\n[Verse 2: Twista]\nWhat can I say to make you see how the fuck I feel\nTo make me wanna run up in ya home\nShoot you in the dome, if you bustin my body up with the chrome\nI still'll be in the zone like Capone\nBetter leave me alone, cause I represent the city known for killin' motherfuckers\nMakin' plenty money and layin' mack down\nCam, Buk and Twista spittin' gritty competition what a pity\nYou ain't fuckin' with it then put ya stash down\nCome at the family you touched, uh\nI'll shoot up ya V-12 even if you with ya female, huh\nYou was talkin' shit nigga wassup\nFuckin' up ya Sprewell's and ya new interior detail\nAnd a nigga standin' too tall to fall, comin' so I hope y'all can crawl\nBloody up the vest all the wall\nSacrifice my body screamin' Kamikaze, I can take all of y'all...\n\n[Verse 3: Cam'ron]\nY'all niggas play around, guns I wave around\nNigga better stay down, lay down, weigh pounds\nPut 'em on the Greyhound, ride it up to K-Town (Chi-Town)\nThe boy get nasty 'til law enforcement blast me\nSawed-off and I'm happy, raw, where the crack be?\nPut it right off of Pulaski\nCross street, don't need to be said\nCode red, I already got beef with the Feds\nPut three in ya head, from the street full of lead\nFuck knee-deep, you'll be six feet with the dead\nStreet sweeper when I creep creep, nigga fled (Flii-Flii)\nWhen ya sleep sleep, nigga dead\nRight on the back block, fight in the crack spot\nJackpot, ask not yes why not..\n\n[Chorus: Twista (Yung Buk of Psycho Drama)]\n(That's your adrenaline rushhhhh)\nLike when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump\nTo make his opposition chest kick up and jump\nWhen you lit up the gun, to make ya body get up and uhh\n(That's your adrenaline rushhhhh)\nLike when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump\nTo make the trigger pick up and dump\nSo turn the bass kick up the bump\nAnd let the rhythm hit off the trunk\n\n(That's your adrenaline rushhhhh)\nLike when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump\nTo make his opposition chest kick up and jump\nWhen you lit up the gun, to make ya body get up and uhh\n(That's your adrenaline rushhhhh)\nLike when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump\nTo make the trigger pick up and dump\nSo turn the bass kick up the bump\nAnd let the rhythm hit off the trunk\n\n[Verse 4: Cam'ron]\nYa bitch is a hoe, she chill at the Rucker, you really a sucka\nBig Will tryin' to grill her and cuff her\nAnd Killa done fucked her, in love with the chick, the slut was a fish\nThrew her bait, reeled her in and gutted the bitch\nAnd now she, up in Pokip's, dick, huggin' the strip, slick\n5th tucked in her hip, she will mug you for kicks\nAnd word to, mother I'm rich, hit ya mother with bricks\nCoke or ones you build buildings with, concussion the bitch...\n\n[Verse 5: Twista]\nCome and feel with the baller who's the nicest\nAnd causin' the crisis\nGot the ammo and agility that says rewind means growin' before\nAnd this livin' and pause and this likeness\nI can spit it for some who for nigga represent the call of the righteous\nOr gang bang to the rhythm when I spit it\nI'ma kill 'em with the technical precision\nThat'll be fuckin' up all the devices\nGet sick with it like I'm lit off the wet\nIf it's beef, get the shit off ya chest\nDon't take off ya vest, all my niggas make you jump off the set\nAnd always get the prints of the TEC, straight off the deck\nMobbin' up and makin niggas duck\nKnowin' I'll still open up the trunk, guns nigga we get 'em and bust\nMurderin' the enemy is the ultimate adrenaline rush\n\n[Chorus: Twista (Yung Buk of Psycho Drama)]\n(That's your adrenaline rushhhhh)\nLike when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump\nTo make his opposition chest kick up and jump\nWhen you lit up the gun, to make ya body get up and uhh\n(That's your adrenaline rushhhhh)\nLike when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump\nTo make the trigger pick up and dump\nSo turn the bass kick up the bump\nAnd let the rhythm hit off the trunk\n\n(That's your adrenaline rushhhhh)\nLike when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump\nTo make his opposition chest kick up and jump\nWhen you lit up the gun, to make ya body get up and uhh\n(That's your adrenaline rushhhhh)\nLike when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump\nTo make the trigger pick up and dump\nSo turn the bass kick up the bump\nAnd let the rhythm hit off the trunk"}]}
