Crabs in a basket\nYou make it somewhere and they just grabbin' you back in\nAmateur rappers and their mans wanna battle\nAnd turn pale in the face like they last name Jackson\nI admit, it was early for that\nWe still embarrassin' and damagin' the burliest cats\nBut on a higher note J. STEEZ play keys\nYou can tell by the respect that I have earned in the trap\nSee some say he the hottest in his class\nThe rest talk trash, I acknowledge it and laugh\nJockin' on my swag put the product in a bag\nSince Erlenmeyer I learned to put the fire to the flask\nAnd came through with that crack spit\nNew to the league straight ballin' off a draft pick\nYou can tell all them amateurs that you rappin' with\nThat I been going rampant since I came into this rapping shit\nStaying passionate\nWrapping my hand around any rapper in my caliber coming after it\nDon't think they got the pamphlet and the manuscript\nBut every style of art they crafted I mastered it\nSo bow down to your sensei I been paid\nYoung boss since the tenth grade\nNow I see through flows, like water\nI'm flyer than C3P0 and Skywalker\n\n[Verse 2: Joey BADA$$]\nToo much west coast dick lickin', too many niggas\nGettin' caught slippin', knittin' mittens into kissin' kittens\nToo many chickens wanna be pigeons, shittin' over\nStadiums, and leave it drippin' on your cranium\nToo many niggas think they gon' blow like Arabians\nThinkin' they gon' eat next like Drake, no Canadian\nThe best in the universe put you in a hearse\nIf I don't get my space like alien, the kid is fire, don't play with him\nThe fam used to baby him because he was the youngest\nHe made a few adjustments and then proved that he wasn't dumbest\nI keep the fly-est chicks with the flattest stomachs\nClaim they just wanna get high, but on the low, they be down to suck it\nAnd I'm not the one to fuck with, but fuck it\nLeave the ruckus to a musket if you punk niggas can't take the judgment\nThey love it, do a couple shows and I collect my hundred\nIt barely budge my budget but it ain't nothin' I stay stuntin'\nThey stay frontin' like I'm at the back, rear door\nBecause I'm real though, and I've always been a weirdo nigga\nA young Caesar but he never kept his hair low\nThe dear flow flows through ear flows explodes earlobes\nAnd therefo' I remain the Pharoah\nSittin' on my royal chair, ho, with a gold-adorned sombrero\nCame through I jacked the throne, you know the troop style\nLet's sit em' down, and crown him like a root canal, bitch\nWe some bad ass motherfuckers, nigga"}]}
