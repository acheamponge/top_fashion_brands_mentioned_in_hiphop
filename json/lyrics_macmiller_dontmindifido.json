Dope with me\nOther fools homo, Roy and Siegfried\nNo disrespect though\nI got addictive cigarette flow for the green pesto, presto\n\n[Chorus: Adam Young]\nI'd like to make myself believe\nThat planet earth turns slowly\nIt's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep\nCause everything is never as it seems\n\n[Verse 2]\nMe, I'm highly underestimated\nSo educated in getting paid quick\nIf you ever hated, anticipate that I'm famous\nGot a bunch of bitches to sip on the champagne with\nCelebrate that we seeing another day, life good\nNever wanna end this\nMe and Mary Jane got a really nice friendship\nYeah they give me money but I gotta go and spend it\nMan, I been a bad little jew\nBut I gotta pay the bills now so I gotta chill out\nI ain't walking 'round like I'm splurging with a mill now\nFeel like the kid working at the mill now\nUsed to just chill and smoke joints up at Bill's house\nNow I gotta schedule, things I gotta do\nDoing interviews, see it up on YouTube\nI say it feels just like a dream\n'bout to wake up from a nap\nHow fucked up was that?\nLike\n\n[Chorus: Adam Young]\nI'd like to make myself believe\nThat planet earth turns slowly\nIt's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep\nCause everything is never as it seems\n\n[Outro]\nThis shit just feels good I'm not gonna lie\nJust some motherfucking kids\nWe just some motherfucking kids", "year": "2010-08-13", "album": "K.I.D.S", "title": "Don\u2019t Mind If I Do"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
