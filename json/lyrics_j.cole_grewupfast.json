Cole]\nNigga I grew up fast, then blew up fast\nMoney fallin out my pockets I got too much cash\nCan't fit nothin in her pockets she got too much ass like goddamn\nWell if you must ask\nWe from the school of hard knocks but your crew cut class\nHalf white but don't think I got a Klu Klux pass\nWhen I'm up in the V, police be fuckin with me\nNo sir no license all I got here is this fuckin degree\nMove along cocksucker ain't nothin to see\nUnless you talkin blockbusters, you niggas is not Russell\nYou more Diggy - me I'm more Biggie\nNo diss to the young boy im just rappin get bored quickly\nJust to make up for that line invite him on tour with me\nShow him the game let him finagle these whores with me\nRun through they doors with me, hit the Ritz-Carlton for the night\nLeave him there with two dykes probably change a nigga life right\nWhat up Vanessa, I loved you that one semester\nThanks to my profession I balled like Uncle Fester\nThinkin about the board I use to have above the dresser\nHalf the shit I wrote down I did it, its old now got\nNew goals, plus my money on Manute Bol\nFunny how my old highs is suddenly my new lows\nTired of every chick sayin she models before she swallow\nSo I only fuck with hat tricks, bitches with a few goals\n\n[Bridge]\nNiggas keep askin me how I feel how ya feel\nIt's Coleee\n\n[Verse 2: J. Cole]\nNot even slightly interested in what ya opinion is\nI gotta greater purpose then a hater purpose\nI'mma stack paper, hustle just to relax later\nServe niggas and bring change that's a waiter's purpose\nLook how I made em nervous, niggas is shakin, I know they fakin'\nOkay you a killer right, and Miss Cleo is Jamaican\nAnd Bob Marley is Haitian and me and Beyonce datin'\nAnd Jesus Christ be hatin, got mad love from Satan\nFor fuckin Sanaa Lathan while Meagan Good is waitin'\nI'm the deadbeat father of your little brother\nIn other words goddamnit I'm a bad motherfucker\nIt's Cole, it's only right I brought back the soul\nY'all got way too electro, damn near techno\nHalfway homo, way too metro\nHennesy XO, Cole flow special\nStyle like Tribe Called Quest meets Death Row\nLearn somethin boy, grow yo ass up\nCheap nigga if you was liquor I'd probably throw yo ass up\nMatter a fact if you was grass I'd probably mow yo ass up\nLast call for you old niggas go and pour yo last cup\n\n[Outro: J. Cole]\nYea, yea, yea yea, Cole World\nThis nigga Ib...he's a bitch\nHe told me to talk shit to you niggas, so I'mma talk my shit\nDreamville in the building\nI know what y'all want me to talk about, what y'all want to me to discuss\nBut we'll get to that later; them bitch ass niggas...\nMy nigga Big Sean in the building\nMy nigga Canei on the beat"}], "artist": "J.
