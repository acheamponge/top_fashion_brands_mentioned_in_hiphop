When you add 1 and 2 up what does that equal up to?\n\nYo that equals up to 3 which is the Understanding\n\nAnd give me a better phrase for the Understanding so they can understand you\n\nOk the Understanding's a clear picture that one draws up in the mind of Knowledge and Wisdom, ok, which is perfectly understood by the all-seeing eye which is the mind\n\nOk brother I can go with that. Well I hear the Understanding is also the child, and I know that we must teach the children what?\n\nGotta teach them the freedom and the truth\n\nAnd what is the truth so they may stand in what though?\n\nA square of Pure Righteousness, hmm"}], "artist": "Lakim Shabazz"}
