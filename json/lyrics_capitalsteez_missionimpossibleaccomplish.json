Rawls - Cao]\n\n[Capital STEEZ]\nSee don't mind if I do\n\nI be your locksmith, you be my accomplice, mission impossible accomplished (x2)\n\n[Hook: Junior Bell]\nThey say love is blinded sometimes you never know\nBut it's a thing you find and you'll never want to let go\nYou gotta free your mind, you gotta see the signs\nOpen up your eyes, Open up your eyes\n\n[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]\nSo, I'll admit that I don't know what love is\nI still tend to use the word \"like\" in the wrong sense\nThe best thing I had, I was in a rush to throw away\nA way it ended on a note with nothing more to say\nLet alone drop the Prada try to make it far\nOld mistakes we want it all but on a larger plate\nI learn to late and can't have her\nI brought the silver platter but its like it never mattered\nNow we can do the unthinkable my minds post-grad\nBut my heart's back in middle school\nPeople say moving on is always the hardest thing to do\nCause even than I'mma think of you\nMy one and only your the first of many\nThe best I ever had or the worst of plenty\nBut if I had a second chance I would be a better man\nJust to insure that you won't forget me\nI never knew a love like this\nSo no way I'd ever give up that quick\nAnd each day, I learn a bit about myself\nSo disregard all this confidence\nSee we all do it\nWe're all human\nAnd I don't know it all so we can walk through it\nAnd I know sometimes I talk foolish\nIf you have slightest doubt in me, than I'll prove it\nI lost love so what's left to lose\nWhat's next to prove\nIs when I'm next to you\nThat I'm a better man\nAnd I'm far from perfect\nI'm just hoping you'd accept it too\nAnd if not I can't blame you for that\nI gave you more than enough reasons\nFor not taking me back\nBut on the same note\nHere's a reason to try again\nI understand you don't have to invite me in\nWhen you try I shut it down quick and early\nWe both know how I handle things immaturely\nOne thing that I learn about love\nIs no matter what they say, picture perfect is never certain\nWomen learn faster than men do\nBut this is something I would gladly rekindle\nSee, you probably thought this was easy to right\nBut the first two went through have of my pencil\nLove isn't a crime and it can build the most simple of mind\nIf it's given with time\nAnd this is all I can give you of mine\nA piece of my heart, and if you didn't want to listen its fine\nIt's all I can give you of mine\nA piece of my heart, and if you didn't want to listen its fine\nSo I'mma just sit and rewind reminiscing cause your just another victim of time\n\n[Hook]"}]}
