I toss and turn, I keep stressin\u2019 my mind, mind\nI look for peace, but see I don\u2019t attain\nWhat I need for keeps this silly game we play, play\nNow look at this\nMadness the magnet keeps attracting me, me\nI try to run, but see I\u2019m not that fast\nI think I\u2019m first but surely finish last, last\n\n\u2018Cause day n nite\nThe lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite\nHe\u2019s all alone through the day n nite\nThe lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite\nDay n nite\nThe lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite\nHe\u2019s all alone, some things will never change\nThe lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite\n\nHold the phone\nThe lonely stoner- Mr. Solo Dolo\nHe\u2019s on the move, can\u2019t seem to shake the shade\nWithin his dreams he sees the life he made\nMade\nThe pain is deep\nA silent sleeper, you won\u2019t hear a peep, peep\nThe girl he wants don\u2019t seem to want him too\nIt seems the feelings that she had are through\nThrough\n\nCause day n nite\nThe lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite\nHe\u2019s all alone through the day n nite\nThe lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite\nDay n nite\nThe lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite\nHe\u2019s all alone, some things will never change\nThe lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite\n\nSlow mo\nWhen the tempo slows up and creates that new, new\nHe seems alive, though he is feelin blue\nThe sun is shinin man he\u2019s super cool\nCool\nThe lonely nites, they fade away he slips into his white Nikes\nHe smokes a clip and then he\u2019s on the way\nTo free his mind in search of\u2026\nTo free his mind in search of\u2026\nTo free his mind in search of\u2026\n\nDay n nite\nThe lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite\nHe\u2019s all alone through the day n nite\nThe lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite\nDay n nite\nThe lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite\nHe\u2019s all alone, some things\nWill never change\nThe lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah ah at\nNight"}]}
