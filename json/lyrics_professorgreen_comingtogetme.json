M... M...M .. M ...M ... mad ya know\nMatters not cause I'm the man here now\nNnnn... na na na ... got a couple fans here now\nThen got a couple more\nBefore I got 'em I was sure it was what I wanted\nBut now it's poppin' I'm not so sure, cause I get spotted\nEven when I'm popping out my door\nWhats that mean?\n\nMy face is painted unlike I'd like it to be\nBut this is what I signed on the dotted line for\nThey ain't no way that I would want it to see\nBut things are getting a little out of control\n\nThey're coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me\n\nThey're coming to get me thought I was ready for the fame that I've got\nThey're coming to get me thought I was ready for the fame but I'm not\n\nI'm frightened look at the tattoo's on my neck\nHow can I hide them, their ain't a disguise that works\nI've tried them, aside for a turtle neck jumper\nWhich ain't exactly practical with summer I'm stuck\nWhat can I do, I put myself in, I got myself in the stew\nGot myself in the charts then got myself in the news\nHow long until they get a picture of myself in the nude, Ah\nCause now people wanna sell a story\nIt;s my life how can they tell it for me\nI'm sorry I'm just trying to find a way to manage the stress\nThe thought of a kiss & tellers doing *into a mumble*\nI can't even get impressed without worrying & getting about being paranoid\nAt a chick I date to say ... a quick to the tabloid ah\nIt's a lot different now it has happened\nBut even though I had it, when I'm smling\nBelieve I am annoyed cause ...\n\nThey're coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me\n\nThey're coming to get me thought I was ready for the fame that I've got\nThey've coming to get me thought I was ready for the fame but I'm not", "year": null}]}
