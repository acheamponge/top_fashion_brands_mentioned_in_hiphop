{"artist": "Immortal Technique", "songs": [{"title": "In Da Club Freestyle", "lyrics": "I know I look like Immortal Technique to you\nBut I created this genetic clone just to speak to you\nMe and 279 are plantin' a bomb in the building\n'Cause underground shows never got women and children\nI'm serial-killin' every fake nigga alive\nSo most people tryin' to rap won't survive\nMachine-gun everything around me like a panorama\nAnd burn rubber with the ghost of Princess Diana\nI'm like Santana: pullin' strings in the game\nWhile slaves emulate their masters livin' the same\nForget the fame, I can't rest a second alone\nI got homeland security tappin' my phone\nBut here's a warning to the government that creeps on me\nI'm like a cum-stained mattress: don't sleep on me\nI roll deep, with a fully loaded AK\nMurder cowards in their sleep like the IRA\nI represent Zone 4 Dawg, that's the best hood\nYou catch a shot while you sittin' in your whip\nLike Tim Westwood\nWhilin' out, you know how we doin' persuin'\nAnd this is freestyle in the meanwhile\nOther cats are spittin' a written bitten composition\nYou're crushed into submission\nThis is Harlem, you'll never rise to stardom, kid\nI came down to London, and you know how we did\nAnd this is off the dome, off of the brain, lyrically insane\nAnd that's how I'm trippin', that's how I'm flippin'\nAyo, check it out, now I'm the illest Latino\nI never had to buy an album back like Benzino\nYou know I'm sick with the flow, spittin' it slow\nAnd yo, I had to go to the bathroom, I made a scramble\nI lost 10 pounds, and I don't even gamble\nSo you know what's happenin'\nWhen I'm rockin' it off of the brain, lyrically insane\nImmortal Technique, sayin' you nice as me, dawg?\nYou straight tellin' lies\nMe and you have never been even like Biggie Smalls' eyes\nWhen will you realize Immortal Technique is iller?\nThe socialist guerrilla, stomp you like a stone pillar\nComin' through, representin' whoever\nCleverly, under the weather, yo, it's like that\nThe Latin assassin will make it happen\nI'm about to go platinum, but when you see me up in the spot\nRockin' it hip-hop off the top of the knot\nAnd yo, that's how it goes, that's how it flows\nThat's how it shows, ayo, it's 96.9\nAyo, I substract the same numbers from both sides\nAnd that's 5-9, and that's fine, and I continue to climb\nI continue to shine, I continue to climb\nThe voice of racism preachin' the gospel, ayo, that's devilish\nA church in America called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist\nForgettin' God is not a religion, but a spiritual bond\nAnd Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Qu'ran\nThey bombin' innocent people, tryin' to murder Saddam\nWhen they gave him those chemical weapons\nTo go to war with Iran\nThis is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings\n'Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a New Age Sally Hemmings\nI break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish\nThe Judas I hang with, the guilt of betrayin' Christ\nYou murdered him, stole his religion, and painted him white\nTranslated in psychologically tainted philosophy\nConservative political right wing, ideology\nGlued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation\nI got my back to the wall, I'm facin' assassination\nGuantanamo Bay, federal incarceration\nHow could this be, the land of the free, home of the brave?\nIndigenous holocaust, and the home of the slaves\nCorporate America dancin' offbeat to the rhythm\nThey really think this country never sponsored terrorism\nHuman rights violations, we continue the saga\nEl Savador and the contras in Nicaragua\nAnd on top of that, they still wanna take me to prison\nJust 'cause I won't trade humanity for patriotism\nAyo, I'm still buggin' out, I know you flipped the instrumental\nWhich is coincidental, I'm spittin' off the top of the mental\nAyo, this government is tappin' my phone\nLike I told you before, I'm keepin' it raw\nI smash your kids hands in a car door\nAnd thats how it goes, you know there\u2019s ill and there's crazy\nImmortal Technique blazingly, amazing MC's\nYo, I'm hangin' out with the illest rappers alive\nAnd yo, I strive to be better, I strive to survive\nI strive to strap a live wire to the top of my brain\nI make cuts on my dick with masochistic tactics\nAnd then take a fat ish\nWhile simultaneously stabbin' a pregnant fat bitch\nOn a vomit-covered mattress\nWhile the featus uses my dick to practice gymnastics\nDancin' on it like a balance beam, doin' backflips\nAyo, I smack kids, and I compact them, ayo, I subtract them\nAnd I'm keepin' this freestyle from the brain\nI'm lyrically insane, let me explain\nAyo, let me give you the rap-up from 2003\nPeople went to war and they tried to drag me and everyone else, and now we about to put Tony Blair back on the shelf\nWe're takin' it over, my word to Jehovah\nI don't got a Range Rover, I be in the tube, I be at the [\u2026]\nSpittin' on people's faces and whilin' out\nAyo, no doubt, I keep it complete, Immortal Technique\nAnd I can even flip it in Spanish, make rappers vanish\n{Proceeds to rap in Spanish}\nLike, Immortal Technique, I be chillin', with my boy Clamento\nAyo, Ralph Dogg dot com, log on, so we can drop bombs\nYo, Bragging Rights to hook dot com\nTo Rock Steady, you're not ready\nWon every battle in New York city\nYour style is not pretty, kinda like Macy Gray\nAhaha, and my faith in God is kinda shitty\nI'll put my hand on a Bible and tell Whoopi that she's pretty\nAnd this is some mean stuff\nThat I'm spittin' off the top of the brain\nAyo, you know how I rock, 2-7-9\nThat means you catchin' eighteen shots\nAnd that's how it goes, and that's how it flows\nAnd I'm out of here, I'm out with your ho\nI'm with your masters and the cash in the Jetta\nSinceramente Technique, end of the letter", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1-immortal_technique-20101005.Jpg", "album": null, "year": null}]}
