I'ma write um\nIf you're  my one and only\nInsert your name and be with liam\n\nI don't wanna know what it could've been\nThe door got locked, never got back in\nI don't sleep sober, now it's all over\nMe against the world, I'm just tryna win       x2\n\nAll my life, I've been doubted on\nBut all my life, never doubted on\nThey stop, they look, they stare\nBut I ain't goin nowhere\n\nLost some people that I used to love\nSometimes send prayers, to them up above\nNow they feel this heat, i dont really care\n(na na na I don't really care)\n\nNow It's me against the world\nBut that is not a bad thing\nI take care of myself\nNow that is what is interesting\n\nCause I Got pride for my life\nMake sure my familys alright\nAnd I'm gonna live this way\nUntil it is my time to die\n\nLakey"}], "artist": "Lakey"}
