Oh, I'm with that bastard Jon\nIn the Porsche and the seats are made of mastodon\nHe had an accident and now he got a plastic arm\nGot paid, got his mom a nail salon\nGot laid, he can choose 'em from a catalogue\nRussian, Taiwanese, whatever\nThey say I'm looking Siamese in leather\nLittle red devil on the dresser\nWriting red pencil on the letter\nThin slices of the cheddar\nFold it up make my life better\nWe had the lunch at Osteria Morini\nI had the calf's brain\nHalf glass of Cabernet on the PATH train\nNew year they still love me for my past fame\nLike a soccer player call me by my last name\nA young Zinedine Zidane\nIn Flushing Meadow Park drinking hennessy with mom\nYou might catch me out in Tennessee with wine\nWon't even dine unless the ice sculpture centerpiece a swan\n\n[Outro]\nFly away\nShit, won't even dine\nUnless the ice sculpture centerpiece a swan\n\n[Phil Mickleson Enbrel commercial]", "title": "It\u2019s Me", "album": "Blue Chips 2", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3tkvpk6nyazea6ub0nsnj8s01.500x500x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
