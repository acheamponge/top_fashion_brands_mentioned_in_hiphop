It's almost over\u2014the end is near\nJudgement Day.  Didn't rush to this moment, but did prepare\nI couldn't see through the weed smoke\u2014it's getting clear\nGood eyes of 20/20 vision peer\nAlways take my wife's advice that she said in the prison chair\n\u2018Cause the females are very observant and women stare\n\"You should fear nothin' but God.\u201d  I didn't care\nI said, \u201cI'd rather die in courage than live in fear\u201d\nLied on a stack of Bibles in court, but didn't swear\nBoth boots stand in a square of truth\u2014I'm in a square\nTold Rosa Parks that nigga seats are in the rear\nNow the White House is the Black House, we livin' there\nIt's not like I had knowledge that I didn't share\nBreathe life into the mentally dead, I give 'em air\nRide 'til the wheels fall off, a shirt the quitters wear\nJack it up and change that tire, we ride with a spare\n\n[Hook \u2013 Saigon]\nDoes the Lord hear a sinner\u2019s prayer?\nWhen I die, if I make to the gate, will they let me into there?\nAs I look at this crook in the mirror\nWith all this dirt on my hair\nDoes the Lord hear a sinner\u2019s prayer?\nThis is a sinner's prayer\nWhen I die, if I make to the gate, will they let me into there?\nAs I look at this crook in the mirror\nWith all this dirt on my hair\nDoes the Lord hear a sinner\u2019s prayer?\n\n[Verse 3 \u2013 Omar Epps]\nFirst off, here's a theory to quote\nTryna hide from the eyes of God is really a joke\nNo matter your area codes, just the various folks\nWho wanna walk amongst the King, but they barely get close, and, uh\nMasquerade with your blasphemous ways\nClaim you masters of the universe but actually slaves\nThose shenanigans will get you smacked in your face\nExposed like mannequins before they back on display\u2014get it?\nInstead of feeding people the truth\nThey propagandize everything you see on the news\nMisleading the youth.  But they can't imprison your mind\nYou don't need 20/20 to see niggas is blind\n[?] from the biblical time\nNow is that subtracting or adding to your spiritual crimes?\nYou don't wanna listen?  Nigga, close your ears\nWhen you get caught up, the system will divulge your fears\n\n[Hook \u2013 Saigon]\nDoes the Lord hear a sinner\u2019s prayer?\nWhen I die, if I make to the gate, will they let me into there?\nAs I look at this crook in the mirror\nWith all this dirt on my hair\nDoes the Lord hear a sinner\u2019s prayer?\nThis is a sinner's prayer\nWhen I die, if I make to the gate, will they let me into there?\nAs I look at this crook in the mirror\nWith all this dirt on my hair\nDoes the Lord hear a sinner\u2019s prayer?", "album": "G.S.N.T. 3: The Troubled Times of Brian Carenard"}], "artist": "Saigon"}
