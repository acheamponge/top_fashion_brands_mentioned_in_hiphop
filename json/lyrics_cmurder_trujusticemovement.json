With no release date?\nIf your life is on the line, you know that's what they gonna take\nI think it's safe to say that the system crooked\nThe judge, the DA, even the bitches that working booking\nShit I'm steady looking, watching them take my life from me\nThey trying to [?] sentence me to a century\nShit is real, when you living a life of crime\nLook what they did C-Murder, giving him all the time\nShit, but don't stress, just keep your patience\nThrough trials and tribulations, and one day we all gon' make it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhat goes around comes around\nYeah, it's true, and I suffer a consequence for most crimes that I do\nI remember what they did to C-Murder, it's nothing new\nAnd having no evidence is a reason to cut him loose\nIt's a must, I keep it real, spit facts when I speak\nYeah I lived a life of crime, but what about the police\nWhat about the DA and the judges who sentenced me\nOpen your eyes, pay attention so you can see\nThe court is in session\n\n[Verse 1]\n\n[Hook]"}]}
