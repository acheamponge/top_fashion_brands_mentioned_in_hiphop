Word.  (Saigon).  Yo dawg.  What up?  Holler back, man.  (Abandoned Nation).  This here.  This here ain\u2019t for errybody, man.  This is for the real ones.  (Whoo Kid)\n\n[Verse 1: Saigon]\nThis here is for all the missed peers I left in the pen\nEven the ones I\u2019ll never see ever again\nWhen I get on, I take care of your brethren and them\nThey talk about you all the time\u2014you a legend to them\nIf I could, I would just make the time fast-forward\nNew York is a lot different than when you last saw it\nYeah, dawg, it\u2019s mad more chicks.  But the pussy ain\u2019t free no more\u2014them whores want cash for it\nPolice\u2019ll still harass-a-holics.  Most niggas under thirteen still be on some basketball shit\nBut the ones older than that, they rolling in packs\nAnd at least three of these niggas is holding a gat\nAnyway, God, I kind of miss walking the yard\nTalking with y\u2019all \u2018cause now I\u2019m in New York and it\u2019s hard\nI done caught a new charge.  I lost the god J-E-R-R-Y.  Why he had to die?\nI thought \u201cWhen I get home, I see love get shown\u201d\nAll I seen was drug strips sown and slugs get thrown\nShould I play the good guy or should I\nThrow in the hood, I (Should I?) make some niggas in the hood die?\n\n[Bridge: Saigon]\nShould I?  Huh?  (Tell me, man.  Omnipotent, man).  Huh?  (Let me know.  Somebody write me, man).  You tell me, man.  (I don\u2019t know what the fuck to do).  For real.  (I\u2019m losing it out here, man.  But you know what, man?  (What you used to do?))\n\n[Verse 2: Saigon]\nI used to stand on the block, selling cooked-up rock\nMoney busting out my sock \u2018cause I really would clock\nI [taught to?] robbing the spot\u2014shit\u2019ll really get got\nWhenever the gun\u2019s hot, niggas really get shot\nDon\u2019t give a fuck if you a willy or not\nIf you got what I need, I\u2019mma receive or the milly\u2019ll pop\nSo what the verdoct?  The bird drop.  Throw the rock like Elvis Grbac\nWord, I\u2019m verbally hot like the Third Rock\nAnd I\u2019m repping the pen in every song I ever sung in\nIt\u2019s all I know\u2014shit, I was brung in as a youngin\nBear witness to coming\nReal rap right on time while all y\u2019all crime-rhyme niggas is slumming\nY\u2019all muhfuckas see a nigga\u2014I\u2019m still bumming\nBut I got game, so I can still cum in your woman\nYou could still catch one in the stomach\nAnd I still let the MAC strike.  You act like you want it or something\n\n[Outro: Saigon]\nHuh?  (Ha ha).  Punk.  (That\u2019s right).  Motherfucker.  (Fuck all y\u2019all.  I\u2019m here)", "album": "The Best of Saigon A.K.A.
