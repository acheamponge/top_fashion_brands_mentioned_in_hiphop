The desperate\nMad at me because they lack a strategy for exit\nHuh, nobody pregnant, nobody get burped\nI got lost on this head trip but I won't talk to an expert\nMy legs hurt cause I've been walking with cement boots\nEver since you lured me to the water bed to get cute\nShe had a wet suit and dry disposition\nBut couldn't execute this type of mission\n\nIt's no small time thing organizing my ending\nMy book of life is a choose your own adventure with a circular section\nYou told your friends I walked all over you\nBut you know that's not what these boots were made to do\nIn fact, you had them crafted at the store\nYou said, \"Baby, put them on\", I don't know what you take me for\nKnew something was up when they got nailed to the floor\nSince the key didn't work, I kicked my way through the door\n\nI keep moving, I go from house to house\nI stay committed like one foot in, one foot out\nI bounce (bounce), yeah I'm leaving this place\nDivorce papers falling out my briefcase\n\nI keep moving, I go from house to house\nI stay committed like one foot in, one foot out\nI bounce (bounce), yeah I'm leaving this place\nDivorce papers falling the fuck out my briefcase\n\nI am no destination\nI am just a journey\nSo don't go settling on me, love\nNo, don't go settling on me\n\nI am no destination\nI am just a journey\nSo don't go settling on me, love\nNo, don't go settling on me\n\nI am no destination\nI am just a journey\nSo don't go settling on me, love\nNo, don't go settling on me\n\nSpeak of me in your travels\nTake pictures if you please\nBut don't go settling on me, love\nNo, don't go settling on me\n\nDon't go settling on me, love\nNo, don't go settling on me\n\nAnd I found something here I want you to have\nIt's not much, just a story, but it's all I got so take it\nIt's called Dylan\nDylan's drug of choice was \"more\"\nSo Dylan took more and more and more\nUntil the day he woke up babbleling in the pool of his own traffic jam\nRealizing he is killing off the best parts of himself\nAnd claiming he could read peoples skin\n\nWhen he looked down at his heart flap, it said \"boy, go find your spine, and ride it out of here.\"", "album": "Human the Death Dance"}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
