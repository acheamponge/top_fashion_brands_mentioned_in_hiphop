(Why?)\nShe's not here right now, she's not here right now\nWhy am I the one you wanna get into it with for the drama?\nI've got a lot to say, and that's the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now\n\n[Chorus]\nSpendin' all my days on the east side, oh\nForgettin' who I was on the other side, oh\nYoung nigga switchin' up the program right now\nTryna put the power in my own hands right now\nI'm about to ride through the old hood right now\nGot too much pride for my own good right now\nWaitin' on you to give in and hit me up\nSo I could fall through like old times and hit it up\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over\nThose nights when you need someone else, call me over\nYou can be the one to take control, call me over\nWhen I get there, you already know, call me\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhy you keep askin' me about... (Why?)\nCouple other things I'd rather do than talk about that right now\nTold you 'bout givin' him chances on chances on chances\nHe's not holdin' you down, he's holdin' you back right now\n\n[Chorus]\nSpendin' all my days on the east side, oh (Oh, oh-oh-oh)\nForgettin' who I was on the other side, oh\nYoung nigga switchin' up the program right now\nTryna put the power in my own hands right now\nLove it when your ass speak the truth to me, oh\nTryna wake up and have you with me, oh\nWaitin' on you to give in and hit me up\nSo I could fall through like old times and hit it up\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over\nThose nights when you need someone else, call me over\nYou can be the one to take control, call me over\nWhen I get there, you already know, call me\n\n[Interlude: Drake & Rihanna]\nYeah, ayy\nYeah\nI I threw my hands in the air and said show me somethin', yeah\nAyy\n\n[Verse 3]\nRemember one night I went to Erykah Badu house\nShe made tea for me\nWe talked about love and what life could really be for me\nShe said, \"When that shit is real, you just know\"\nAnd I was thinkin' 'bout you, you already know\nYeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house\nHe had weed for me\nThat my nigga 'til we gone, keep his ear to the streets for me\nSaid the city stress him out on the low\nI said, \"I feel you, nigga, I already know\"\nYeah, already...\nGirls talkin' 'bout, \"You gotta leave already?\"\nDamn, my lil' nephew turned four already\nGave you little help, you need more already\nDamn, you need more already?\n'Fore you said \"You're mine\" I was yours already\n22, had the Bentley four-door already\nEven as a boy, I was the boy already\nSo you know that that mean pussy galore already\nMention other girls, you get insecure already\nThat was in the past, I matured already\nFuck them hoes, you got the award already\nYou go to Chanel and get rewards already\nKnow I do this shit for Third Ward already\nKnow I do this shit for H-Town already\nAlready, already, yeah\nBack up in this thing, it's a go\nHad a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know\nAin't the first time 'cause I lost you before\nHad to get it back, had to get it back\nHad to pull it back because I know I'm on the road\nHad to take you back because I know you're down to roll\nIf you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know\nAll your friends askin' where you stand with the boy\nFaceTime say you got plans for the boy\nStudyin' your body, that's exams for the boy\nTake a flight here, pop a Xan for your boy\nWaking up in Amsterdam with the boy\nLong flight home, 'nother Xan for your boy\nYou would prolly fly out to Japan for the boy\nYou would prolly kill another man for the boy\nYou would prolly...\nYou would prolly lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy\nPut the Bible to your right hand for the boy\nThat's why you ain't never gotta worry 'bout the boy\nYou know you got...\nYou know you got that really good insurance on the boy\nYou just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy, yeah\n(Why?
