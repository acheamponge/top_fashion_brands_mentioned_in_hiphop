Like we're in agreement\nFacts like these don't appear in the cement\nNo hard truth\nJust time\nNo hard proof\nJust rhyme\nNo reason\nJust rhythm\nSeason to season\nWe're just livin'\nAnd we..\nWake up every morning\nEquipped with the tools\nOf the time we were born in\nAnd these tools\nWe use\nTo keep building\nBe-come second nature to the children\nPassed down from a dad to a kid\nI ain't invent the wheel\nBut I'm glad someone did\nCuz if they did not\nThen time would just stop\nThere'd be no jazz\nRock'n'roll or hip-hop\nBut we got\nInfinite sums of choices\nWe've come a long way\nSince just drums and voices.. man\nThis can't be random\nToo well planned for nobody to have a hand in\nNever met EOM but he seems like a friend now\nDigital-musical pen-pal\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Outro]\nMan... yea\nI wrote this all myself\nBut it seems like I had help\nYea I wrote this by myself\nBut I know in my soul that I had a little help\nFrom...\nSomething much bigger than me\nG-o-d or whatever he be\nI don't know man\nI don't know fam\nFreestyle gon' get with the program\nNo man can do it any better than me\nA veteran emcee\nIn the place to be\nI do the..\nFreestyle\nDog[?] the green mile\nWhat the suckas do\nWhat whack mother fuckas do\nWho are you to...\nTry to test me\nI'm cool like Nestea\nYou're sweet like Nestle yea..\nChocolate when I'm rockin' it..", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/Big_Wax_in_Front_of_a_Fence.jpg", "album": null, "title": "Help"}]}
