Don't tell nobody\nI'm back to using, don't tell nobody\nAnd God knows, man I need to stop\nI'm around pills all day it's hard not to pop\nThe feeling, the feeling is slow motion\nI feel like the ocean, I got the magic potion\nMan, I got an addiction, man, I'm on a mission\nTrying to fill this prescription, listen\nAnd man I'm in no position, man, I'm a Christian\nIt feels like I went fishing, listen\nWhy I've tried to explain, why I snort this 'caine\nAnd fly like a plane\nListen\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm crying in the booth\nMy hands tied ain't nothing I can do\nMan, I'm through\nPray for me\n\nHook [2x]\n\n[[Verse 3]\nMarshall quit, why can't I?\nIt's been two weeks, I'ma give it a try\nStay out the clubs, stay out the bars\nIt's calling my name (Bizarre, Bizarre)\nBut, I ain't Marshall, I guess I'm just a fiend\nI can't stay clean off them pills and the lean\nGoing through withdrawals, my back's aching\nCold sweat, my body shaking\nWhat about my girlfriend? What about my daughter?\nFuck that, I need two 7-50's and some water\nPain pills and a whole lot of liquor\nI'm fucking up my kidney, I'm killing all my liver\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm crying in the booth\nMy hands tied ain't nothing I can do\nMan, I'm through\nPray for me\nPray for me..."}], "artist": "Bizarre"}
