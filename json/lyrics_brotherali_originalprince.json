One\nGot a special guest in here tonight\nNo further ado we gon' pass him the mic\nWe said a two, a four\nA six and a eight\nC'mon Faheem, and let's motivate\n\n[Verse] [Faheem]\nWell my name is Faheem and I'm six years old\nI got a hold of the microphone\nI got a pretty face and a pair of brown eyes\nWhen I'm on the mic I hypnotize so\nJump back, catch a heart attack\nAnd you get beat down with a stickball bat\nGet down\nQuit that messin' around\n'Cause Faheem is in your town\nAnd we rock\nYa don't stop\nWe rock\nYa don't stop, hit it!\n\n[Outro] {Faheem]\nShout out Rhymesayers, all around the world\nSamayo, what up?\nJamali\nJacob, nice to see you baby\nSakeeya what up\nWhat's up, Oz?\nAssata, what's good?\nWhat up Pootie?\nRhymesayers! What!\nWho put this together? Me- that's who\nWho do I trust? Me- that's who\nSay goodnight to the bad guy!", "year": null, "album": "Off the Record"}], "artist": "Brother Ali"}
