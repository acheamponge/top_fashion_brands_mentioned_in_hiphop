Shore!\nPeople always want to give dap to everyone\nBut I've been around the world so I ahhh ???\n\n[Hook]\n\"I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king\"\n\"Have the people stomping to my beat you bet\"  (Repeat 4x)\n\n[Verse 2]\nTake a pause for the cause, cause this is a recording\nIf rap was a prison, then I be the warden\nI do the Gator in my snakeskin Jordans\nAnd when it comes to cash I flash more than Gordon\nYou want me to rock the rhyme cause I got the type you crave\nAnd I heat up jams like I was MC Microwave\nAnd when I drop a style, call it def, call it cool\nAs long as you don't call me when I'm on a toliet stool\nI stoke and swin in a room full of women\nWhen I drop the gold like Meadowlark Lemon\nEverywhere I've been I've seen 'em fat and thin\nEven girls with hair on their chinny chin chin\nBut you can be just a friend if you're sporting your own look\nOr if you got more chins than a Chinese phonebook\nWomen love my style from ??? Long Isle\nEven got my mother singing \"Thanks for my Child\"\nMy temperature rises every time I'm near a stereo\nCause I catch dance fever like my name was Danny Terio\nBut I go, on and on and on and on and on and!\nFrom midnight point to the early morning, AHHHH!\n\n[Hook]\n\"I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king\"\n\"Have the people stomping to my beat you bet\"  (Repeat 4x)\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's my way or the highway, I'm ahead of the slow lane\nBut when I ride to Motown I jump on a Soul Train\nRappers like to flow with all energy and action\nBut I'd rather take it nice and slow like Freddy Jackson\nSo don't try to stick to me like somebody's gearshift\nCause I'll hit you so far west you'll come back Easter\nThe style I display, but I say it a badder way\nI got more rhymes than cartoons on a Saturday\nYou're still confused cause you don't know how bad he is\nLike a pregnant ______ who don't know who the daddy is\nJust like a snap I can whip any rapper\nThat's why probably my grandparents called me a whipper snapper\nYou're lost in the sofa trying to cross my line\nThen run to the lost and found cause you lost your mind\nI'm coming on strong cause I'm dropping nothing soft\nStill had it going on when \"The Biz is Going Off\"\nI'm singing in the rain cause I got the audacity\nOr some kids want to sundance with Butch Cassidy\nYou couldn't shine on my in the spotlight\nCause your ass couldn't shine if you sat on a flashlight\n\n[Hook]\n\"I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king\"\n\"Have the people stomping to my beat you bet\"  (Repeat 4x)"}], "artist": "Biz Markie"}
