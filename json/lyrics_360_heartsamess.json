You're crooked as hell\"\nGot me reaching for that angel, in need of a halo\nInstead, I'm right here, speakin' to a stranger\n\n[Chorus (Extended): Gotye (Sampled)]\nYour heart's a mess\nYou won't admit to it\nIt makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect\nYou can't live like this\nYour heart's a mess\nYou won't admit to it\nIt makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect\nYou can't live like this\nYour heart's a mess\nYou won't admit to it\nIt makes no sense but I'm desperate to connect\nYou can't live like this"}]}
