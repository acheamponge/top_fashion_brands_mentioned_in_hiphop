Denzel Curry) \u300cLonestar Jazz\u300d \u6b4c\u8a5e\n\n[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]\nOutside, looking in\nReached me on a place you've never\u2005been\nSee,\u2005I have the\u2005power of many men\nWhen I walk,\u2005you don't see a grin\nIt's my ignorance with intelligence\nMilitant move\nYou should never question the elephant\nI appear, yet I'm barely even here\nWhen you're not around\nThere\u2019s no one that's allowed to see my tears\nAdam to your Eve, apple of your eye\nWhatever the circumstances, know I'll end up on your side\n\nCarole, hit you with the lovestruck arrow\nFeelings start to scat like Ella Fitzgerald\nPharaoh, honestly, I meant to say pheromone\nYou was always there since my parents was never home\nOrphan, cracked fortune\nProtecting my precious orchid from evil forces\nDormant, see the sky's not stormless\nMonday is so heavy\nHit you back on a Tuesday\nWhen things feel steady\nHere's the prophet, the one and only who's laying there\nForever known as E, ain't no need for the alias\nI'm representing Mars till I feel like an alien\nAnd you're the only star that I'll date again, love\n\n[Chorus: Denzel Curry]\nDays without your face\nIt's hard to stay sane alone\nI hate the time you're not here\nYou're the closest thing to home"}], "artist": "Denzel Curry"}
