Them people ask, I won't let 'em know\nI say a prayer to the devil layin' on the floor\nClutch on that stick and I kick in your door\nSuck on that dick, I'ma fuck on your hoe\nMe shawty poppin' pills, we roll\nChristian Louis Vuitton all on my toes\nNo, I'm not puttin' no effort in songs\nThink it then I say it off of the dome\nSay the wrong thing, off with your dome\nNo right, but I still do wrong\n\n[Chorus]\nI see demons in my dreams, versatile\nI got them sets and I pop X, I'm loaded now\nRemember bitches that won't fuck me, they want me now\nI'm drippin' blood out in public, I'ma devil child\n\n[Outro]\nI don't know what wrong with me, feeling like I'm up in trial\nBitch I'm been a demon seed, ever since I was a child\nI see blood in my dreams, and I call it versatile\nI pop sets and I pop X, and I'm rollin' now"}], "artist": "YoungBoy Never Broke Again"}
