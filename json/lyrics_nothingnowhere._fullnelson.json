I'm the captain, your the navigator. Now out there that's the future, back there, well that's the past. If life's moving too slow, you wanna project yourself into the future just step on the gas right here, see?\n\n[Verse 1: Oilcolor]\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m holding on with broken hands\nI see these lies out the corner of my eye\nWhen I grow up I wanna be a ghost\nSo I can see how you feel when i\u2019m not as close\n\n[Bridge]\nIf you wanna slow her down, well hell, you just step on the brake here and you slow her down. This is the present, Phillip. Enjoy it while it lasts\n\n[Verse 2: nothing,nowhere.]\nI'll pretend i\u2019m in my old bed\nTired eyes, tuck me in, pat me on the head\nConstruct a world in which I\u2019m safe again\nGrowing up, giving up, I wish I'd never left"}], "artist": "\u200bnothing,nowhere."}
