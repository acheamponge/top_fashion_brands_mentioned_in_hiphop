(nah)\nThis my personal life this a personal right\nYou can turn from the light then shine on niggas like a baby at birth\nJust peeped this first bit of life\nRight\n\n[Bridge]\nShine, Shine\nShine, Shine\n\n[Verse 2]\nCan't block it where the E clips?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7d5d8951dbe2115350370d2ab03c8097.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2014-05-05", "title": "Red Hot Car", "album": "Two Weeks Notice"}]}
