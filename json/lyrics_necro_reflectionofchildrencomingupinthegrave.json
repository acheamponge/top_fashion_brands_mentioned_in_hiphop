Coming up in the grave...\nReflection of children... Coming up in the grave\n\n[Verse 1]\nMy childhood was hood, shit was real\nMy father was evil, he was a killer already;\nWhen he came here from Israel\nLeaving us scared with a stare, until it transformed\nInto me, putting fear into my peers, that's when the man formed\nIn the projects, we used to beef with each other\nCause our fuckig  parents were too ignorant to each us better\nI had thoughts on my mind of killing someone at nine;\nI actually went to do it lucky for homeboy he backed down at the time\nI could've been dolo and still not flip and get live\nA lot of cats were truly bitch they needed a clique to survive\nMe and Bill had a rep for fucking Deceps up when they stepped\nThey crept deep like roaches and would catch you if you slipped\nPeeping around the project buildings to see who's on the bench\nMight be an enemy you'll have to blood drench on defense\nOnly thing we thought we were promised was dishonest careers\nBeat down and robbed so many people I had bad karma for years\n\n[Sampling: Charles Manson]\n\n[Verse 2]\nControlled by my own rage, my attitude was like whatever\nI never got fucked up by a kid my own age; EVER!\nI was bolder screaming on cats four years older\nI take a lost and Bill will regulate them like a soldier\nForcing friends to stay out late after 8 walking around the PJs\nAt night as a kid because mom dukes had a date\nPlaying tackle football on icesome concrete; we did what we could\nOlder thugs would steal our football like Boyz In The Hood\nWhen I started thugging, kids that were rugged became feeble\nYou could see how they suddenly bitched up when they saw evil\nGrowing up on Farragut even when innocent\nWe weren't having it, something me and my brother had enough some arrogance\nMe and my peeps keeped it gully we had enough\nOne year we made a resolution to take shit from no one no matter what\nThe circumstances no matter who they were they get murdered\nA lot of people got fucked up over that shit and they all deserved it\n\n[Sampling: Charles Manson]\n\n[Verse 3]\nBack in the days, moved into the projects at six\nGot lost the first day I felt like a rat in a maze\nEven in public school I hated kids that were squealing\nThe hustle skills I possess now come from the foundation of drug dealing\nUsed to sit for hours waiting shit on the triple beam\nI had cards made up for fiends to beat me plus little schemes\nIn 5th grade punching teachers in the face\nA derelict on the bleachers I never clicked with a peaceful face\nRockin blue sway pumas copped from church ave\nUnica phaser designs dipped with fly birds kid\nBoosted everything I put in shops from polo\nTo tower record cassettes even when I got caught I wouldn't stop\nHaving cops pull loaded guns to my chest threatening to kill me for no reason\nCause the way we dressed was fresh\nUsed to love to get a reaction\nWhen I whipped out a gun or a 24-inch machete ready for action\n\n[Sampling: Charles Manson]"}], "artist": "Necro"}
