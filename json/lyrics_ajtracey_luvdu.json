(who?)\nEvery bit of beef gets gory\nNo, we can't chat like Maury\nMeat cleaver by the bedside\nWhen I'm in the house like Cory\n\n[Bridge]\nI smell hate up in the air\nI got oil in my hair\nI like candles in my bedroom\nTake a flight, I got the legroom\nQuarter on me, bird call\nOff-White, shoutout Virgil\nI wore denim when it weren't cool\nHad the draws up in my Persil\n\n[Chorus]\nI thought that I loved you but I was wrong\nYou wanted me to be weak\nBut when shit got bad, I was strong\nAnd now I flex up all day long\nI catch feelings way too quick\nBut I lose them so much quicker\nMy old girl's arse was thick\nBut my new girl's arse is thicker\nBut I was, but I was wrong\nYou wanted me to be weak\nBut when shit got bad, I was strong\nAnd now I flex up all day long\nI catch feelings way too quick\nBut I lose them so much quicker\nMy old girl's arse was thick\nBut my new girl's arse is thicker", "year": "2017-10-06", "album": "Secure the Bag!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bb3ef87fb8c9b11455dd7d9d9c74fbf9.499x499x1.jpg"}], "artist": "AJ Tracey"}
