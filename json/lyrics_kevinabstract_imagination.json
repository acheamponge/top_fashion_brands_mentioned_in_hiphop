How could that be?\nThat's what they always ask me\nRun to my dreams like athlete\nUntil my mind is at peace\nBut see\nThey don't really understand that\nPlanning on remaking this planet, until the evil just vanish\nBut that's impossible\nThat's what they say\nAnythings possible\nJust find away\nRight away, I'mma let you know who I am, who I be\nThis crew I lead, anything can happen when you use your\n\n[Bridge: Kevin Abstract)\nImagination\nImagination\nImagination\nImagination\nImagination\nImagination\nImagination\nImagination\n\n[Chorus - Kevin Abstract)\nI wanna welcome you to my world\nFull of diamonds and pearls\nBut you gotta use your imagination\nCome on, get up don't worry\nLet's go, please hurry\nBut you gotta use your imagination\nYour mind is here, the time is here, let your soul be free, don't shed no tears\nIt's time to use your imagination\nI wanna welcome you to my world\nFull of diamonds and girls\nBut you gotta use your imagination\nCome on, get up don't worry\nLet's go, please hurry\nYour mind is here, the time is here, let your soul be free, don't shed no tears\n\n[Outro]\nRight?"}], "artist": "Kevin Abstract"}
