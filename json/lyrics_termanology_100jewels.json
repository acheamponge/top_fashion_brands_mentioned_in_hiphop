Hood knowledge. Get the fuck out the way; Termanology!\n\nThey say I'm a righteous cat\nI write righteous raps\nBut I cut coke, cook it to crack\nThinking what kind of life is that?\nGet tossed in the bin\nNever knowin' when you might come back\nI listen to Jesse Jack\nBlack clip in the gat\nAnd write lyrics to the soul of Geronimo Pratt\nI'm talkin' to anyone who got a problem with that\nI'm everywhere, tell me where your metropolitan at\nI'm right there doin' a show\nChain out, by myself\nMy fist in the air, bang out by myself\nThat's why your girl wanna polish my knob\nAnd every rapper in the city wanna poli so hard\nBut before I do a song with y'all\nI'll blow my brains out on the Bible\nAnd call it the knowledge of God\nMy cousin Gutta get the problems resolved\nHe specialize in cuttin' up niggas nice\nAnd doin' robberies, dog\nProbably y'all\nAnd when I'm whippin' the gauge\nYou gonna be gone in 60 seconds like Nicholas Cage\nPay attention when I'm rippin' the page\nWhen I'm not on stage\nI feel plagued with meticulous rage\nI seen my first nigga shot at a ridiculous age\nBefore Earvin Magin Johnson was a victim of AIDS\nCats thinking cause they sit and they pray\nBecause they Christian they safe\nTil reality just spit in they face\nBut I'll tell you one thing\nWhen bullets start flying\nJesus Christ ain't gonna sit in the way\nLike modern-day slaves how we sit in the maze\nWon't pay your child support but you could chip in for haze\nMy baby mama been trippin' for days\nShe hate the fact I'm a star\nAnd model bitches wanna sit on my face\nShe'd love to see a brother sit in a cage\nTake my daughter away\nAnd let another nigga sit in my place\nMomma told me that it's only a phase\nBut I told Ma dukes, before that I'd put a clip in my fade\nThat's way too much opportunity to sit and embrace\nThe evolution of man, we been sittin' in caves\nBefore I ever had a nickel to blaze\nMeanin' a nickel of weed\nOr a nickel 9 spittin' them strays\nI been tryin' to get my shit on the waves\nDJs holdin' me down but never play my shit in the days\nIt's no way that I might win\nWith only the night spins\nBut- but- but- I ain't gonna sit and complain\nOld timers slingin' shit in they veins\nThey mad as hell\nCause they know it won't hit 'em the same\nCan't slip in any chicken these days\nGive 'em a trip in the Range\nAnd they be lickin' on a pickle with AIDS\nI wish my grandmama could have heard this shit from the grave\nI know she would have loved to hear her boy rip it this way\nOver the beat\nLife's so cold in the street\nYou might get shot up or you could go in your sleep\nTo all my soldiers that die for they flag\nOr that die for their rag\nIt's messed up you had to lay in a bag\nIt's no fair ones\nAin't no more relyin' on jabs\nNow you supply with a mask\nAnd a guy'll just blast\nIt's fucked up I gotta ride in a cab\nBut as soon as I get a check\nI gotta divide it in half\nI feel like I should be right in a Jag\nOn the flight with a mag\nAnd 100 Gs right in the stash\nThey don't wanna see a Puerto Rican writing this bad\nCause when I write on the pad I get it tight and they mad\nI'm hyper but sad\nCause I got a lot of fame in rap\nBut I'm back livin' right with my dad\nI'm part French, part spic, how racist is it that\nPolice wanna treat me like I'm basically black\nI'm basically that\nAnd you don't wanna talk about my gats\nCause they like Charlie Baltimore, they German and black\nIt's hard to earn, but I'm earnin' the stat\nThis the moment of truth\nSo I'm tryin' to write verses like that\nMy vocals burn, set fire to tracks\nThey admirin' that\nThat's why my CDs fly off the rack\nGroupie bitches they be showin' me love\nWhen I roll in the club\nThey lovin' the way that I flow on the drums\nPlus the way I make dough in the slums\nKeep smoke in the lungs\nAnd write rhymes more potent than drugs\nY'all don't wanna end up chokin' on slugs\nWith a throat full of blood\nYou should watch how you open your mug\nWatch how it go down when them pistols around\nCause you could end up with a slug through your wisdom and chow\nBullets flying through your kitchen and blaow\nMore people in the church than the christening now\nIsn't it foul\nProbably could've been avoided but you was too paranoid\nOff sniffin' you ain't seein' choices\nMy voice is something like Kennedy\nExcept you gon' remember me for killin' these mics\nNot gettin' murked out by my enemies\nI'm livin' the life most of these rap niggas pretend to be\nSellin' mean gettin' locked up by the police and my friend'll be\nWay past due if I lay past two\nSo I'm on that early bird shit, grey that goose\nHomie make that loot\nAnd when you baggin' up dimes of drawer\nIt's better to make that loose\nCause it look like it's way more to these customers\nThey don't understand the agenda of real hustlers\nThey just wanna cop what you're sellin' and roll dutches up\nGet they minds stimulated and away from the troubles of\nSituations that we go through throughout our daily life\nWhich homie banging your wife\nIt's probably an A you like\n(And he wanna tell you)\nBut he dont know how he can say it right\nYou'll probably pick up a knife\nAnd slay him that very night\nThen I dont be wifin' up bitches\nCause they be trife\nMake you put it on the line\nLike Ghost and baby Trife\nGet you shot up in your ride\nLike BIG and Obie Trice\nThe bullets ain't nothing nice\nBut until I see the light--\nI'mma live"}], "artist": "Termanology"}
