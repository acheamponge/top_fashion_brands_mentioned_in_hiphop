Can he still kill 'em all off?, kill 'em all off? Looking for myself when I'm lost\nA veteran and better then a motherfucking boss\nAlways get the cheddar but a nigga never floss\nForever the 3rd letter, so choosing your words better, I'm plucking your bird feathers, get the swooping like a hawk\nStupid niggas talk like they really really want it, when I really get up on it then wanna call it off\nBetter shutter with the woofer, break it to 'em with a whooping, niggas hopping out the bushes for this line that I'm pushing\nIndividuals hit 'em with the subliminals, outta the momma criminals, situation get critical\nI'm calling the shots like I'm a general, first time getting physical, fucking on niggas bitches though\nGet the clutching and untucking the pistol for niggas touching my genitals I'm a put something in 'em\nHo niggas don't be pretending, I'm snatching all through in denim, and winning from the beginning can't see me like I'm invisible\nIt's going to take a miracle and spiritual beliefs to compete with the lyricals, I eat niggas\nAnd treat niggas like cereal and creep with material, the miracle for bread or the meat nigga\nT-Nutty I'm the west coast chopper, hit 'em in the chest with a west coast knocker\nImma do my best, never giving nothing less, everything to the left, keep it creeping for the blockstas, blah blah\n\nChorus:\nI'm a gangsta, gangsta, I kick that shit like a gangsta gangsta, I bet you maybe wanna be gangsta, get the whopping at you niggas cause it's gangsta gangsta [x2]"}], "artist": "T-Nutty"}
