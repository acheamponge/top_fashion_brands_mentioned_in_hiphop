I be fucking up I know\nI'm so immature, I just hope she doesn't know\nShe's thinking about peacing fast if he doesn't grow up\nIn the next 5 minutes then she'll up and go\nAnd I'm just saying wait up\nLet me show and prove\nI know I did some things that you really won't excuse\nYou really got something I don't want to go and lose\nBut then she cut me off like when you blow a fuse\nAnd she said to me\n\n[Hook: Devon Baldwin]\nI stand here waiting for you all the time\nHope you recognize before I fall apart\nThe one question staying on my mind\nIs why you keep playing with my heart\nAnd I've been waiting for a long, long time\nSometimes I wonder what made me start\nThe one question staying on my mind\nIs why you keep playing with my heart\n\n[Verse 2: G-Eazy]\nSee I fucked around and always cut it close\nSex is like a drug, I always need another dose\nI swear I got a problem they can't even diagnose\nAnd I always seem to stumble every time I try to coast\nSaying adios to the groupies\nHello again to you\nI swear you got something only shown in a few\nAnd much, much better is what I'm goin' to do\nAnd not sweat someone so miniscule\nHave you ever loved somebody\nThat didn't love you back enough?\nBrings on a bunch of extra baggage like you packing stuff\nI apologize cuz' I know you really had it rough\nIt's my word, Imma' stop acting up\n\n[Hook: Devon Baldwin]\nI stand here waiting for you all the time\nHope you recognize before I fall apart\nThe one question staying on my mind\nIs why you keep playing with my heart\nAnd I've been waiting for a long, long time\nSometimes I wonder what made me start\nThe one question staying on my mind\nIs why you keep playing with my heart\nWhy you keep playing with my\nWhy you, why you, why you keep playing with my heart\nWhy you keep playing\nWhy you keep playing\nWhy, why you keep playing with my heart"}]}
