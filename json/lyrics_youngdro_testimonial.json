{"songs": [{"title": "Testimonial", "lyrics": "[Spoken Word: IYA]\nEveryday I pray to make it out the slums Lord\nBut I know peace don't come easy, so I work hard for it\nGot my ears to these streets, eyes to the sky\nHands on supply, ready to buss on any busta lookin' for a come up\nI speak for the overcomers, for those accustomed to the dungeons\nWhere they ain't no stories of rags to riches, just rags to more raggedy\nAvenues filled with addicts addicted to not having shit\nWhere the helpless get high to cope with their existence\nThe homeless buy hope and kids sit on corners, pitchin' ideas to pass us by wishin' life supplied them with an intermission\nPrayin' for a break, a breakthrough, in a second just to take 'em to the intuition\nTryna sow the sea, our sons and daughters need to see more love more hugs and more kisses\nMy heart's cold, so I suppose I scold my own reflection in the mirror\nBut, one step at a time, may the divine blessed the divine and heal those who hide behind the faces who are sighed\nThis hindsight got my mind right, so I pray my little light encourages yours enough to shine", "album": "Da Reality Show", "year": "2015-09-18", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c0a3acd599ab7913a2dc0b058737a766.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young Dro"}
