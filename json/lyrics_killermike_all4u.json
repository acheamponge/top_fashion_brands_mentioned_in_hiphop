want when you want it\n(Cool and Dre, Killer Mike)\nGive you what you need when you need it\n(I think we got a poor people's anthem)\nBaby we're all gonna make it\n(It's what the streets need and want right now)\n(I'm tellin' you, it's it, some substance baby)\nGive you what you want when you want it\n(I'm givin' it)\nGive you what you need when you need it\n(It's all for you, it's all for you)\nBaby we're all gonna make it\n\nWe came up the hard way\nThe steal or starve way\nSki masks and get robbed way\nFar from Broadway\nTragic but it's no play\nAnd we livin' on the prayers our grandmother pray\nStill remember Big Spank got slayed\nRight on Allen Temple\nMy God poor people you're my heart and it that simple\nAnd I'ma rap through the hurt until I meet dirt\nAnd I'ma make 'em recognize your worth\nThrough the words of my work\nTo the children reared in the gutters\nBy single mothers\nThis might kill your big brother\nSayin' we ain't got much but we got each other\nWe got each other\nOur roads rough, gettin' rougher\nWhen times got tough we got tougher\nWe'll make it, just stay down for one another\nAllow me to spill my heart and say I love you\nAllow me to spill my heart and just say I love you\nC'mon\n\n(Ay girl I know it's hard)\nGive you what you want when you want it\n(Walkin' through the hood, one job(?), two children, groceries)\nGive you what you need when you need it\n(You goin' to work everyday tryin' to keep that car(?), tryin' to keep that apartment)\nBaby we're all gonna make it\n(I'm just here to let you know that I'm witchu sweetheart)\nGive you what you want when you want it\n(I'm witchu everyday Mom)\nGive you what you need when you need it\n(Just feel me)\nBaby we're all gonna make it\n(Somebody understands and feels you, you feel me?)\n\nSisters, I know it seems we're total fuck ups\nBut hold your head up\nWe're slippin', we fallin', but we gon' get up\nAnd we gon' get this life together\nI'll make you a wife and make it better\nMore than a song, an open love letter\nTo all the mothers\nWho lost sons to a gun or life sentence\nWish I could give more than words in a sentence\nThis is your story\nWe are your sons\nThis is my plea for forgiveness\nFor our wrongs\nFor all the hurt we caused and prolonged\nTimes we was weak you stayed strong\nAnd we repaid that by hustlin' crack\nOut the back of your apartment\nThe narcs hit, put your face in the carpet\nYou accepted the risk, never turned snitch\nAnd I still use the word \"bitch\"\nYo, I'm a dumbass, a dipshit\nAnd through it all you claimed and acknowledged me\nI hope this song can serve as my apology\n\nGive you what you want when you want it\n(I'm tellin' you I'm sorry)\nGive you what you need when you need it\n(This next one's for Niecy)\nBaby we're all gonna make it\n(This for you Ma, this for you)\n(Look at you boy, top of the world)\nGive you what you want when you want it\n(Top of the world Mama)\nGive you what you need when you need it\n(And we ain't never goin' back down)\nBaby we're all gonna make it\n\nAll I wanted was a hot pair of Air Force Ones\nSick of being picked on 'cause we was from the slums\nSick of seein' my old man shit on my mom\nSick of feelin' even worse when a new nigga come\nJust wanted to make it better\nJust wanted to make cheddar\nJust wanted to make it so you could walk with you head up\nRap was hope\nAnd I held it like a vendetta\nOr even better, like a Beretta\nKept the rhyme pad tucked under coat and sweater\nI kept 'em like prison letters\nStack neatly in a shoebox\nOn top, stolen Glock and fifty rocks\nDespite the hustle\nRhymes was the means to a end\nI was born to marry thought with a paper and pen\nWasn't born to be on paper or locked in a pen\nI was born to bring honor to this brown skin\nMama I'm your son and your my best friend\nWipe your tears away, just hide it with a graceful grin\n(Give you what you want when you want it)\nI made good and you'll never have to hurt again\n(Give you what you need when you need it)\nI made good and you'll never have to hurt again\n(Niecy's boy done good)\nBaby we're all gonna make it\n(Niecy's boy has done good)\n\nGive you what you want when you want it\n(I'll make you proud)\nGive you what you need when you need it\n(Your name will be spoken with honor baby, believe it)\nBaby we're all gonna make it\n(Niecy's boy done good)\n\nGive you what you want when you want it\n(You see it)\nGive you what you need when you need it\n(Respect and acknowledge it)\nBaby we're all gonna make it\n(I love you baby)\n\n(It's for my people)\nGive you what you want when you want it\n(Bring honor to this skin baby, rise out of it)\nGive you what you need when you need it\n(Come out of the gutter)\nBaby we're all gonna make it\n(We are the diamonds in the rough)\n\nIt's all love\nMy man Mark, my man Rico\nGlide(?), my man Tae, my man Zack\nSlum Lordz 'til death\nI love you\n(It's all for you)\nNiggas better know\n(I love you, I love you, I love you)\nDon't be hard, open your heart\nFeel it, feel it\nMy man Terrence, my man Casko(?) behind bars\n(It's all for you, it's all for you, it's all for you)"}]}
