G\nI'm just thinking 'bout Pimp's next court day, next week\n\nMy son asked me, daddy\nWhy you not been asleep all week?\nI'm money thinking plus\nA lot of niggers plotting on me\n\nOgb, that's my nigga, I know he watching on me\nBmg, that's my company, I'mma die by that\nI put my life on the line\nGotta take that chance\n\nI gotta do it for the streets!\nI'm the voice of the streets!\nYou broke, you listen to me!\nRest in peace to Doe B!\nR.I.P. To Ogb!\nRest in peace to every street nigga!", "album": "Street Lottery 4", "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/f83bee5a7d57e48fccf9b33260a50c0f.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young Scooter"}
