O. D. Ichbabod Crane style\nI stepped into some shit them wiped it with my hand\nSee that's what makes me who I am, goddamn\nNo if and buts or maybes\nYo! E this shit is crazy baby\n\n[Chorus 2X]\n\n[Verse 3]\nOH! That's how it is, that's how you living\nI consider all ya as my children\nFunk like feet collardgreen and chitlens\nI stole your girl while I was in prison (no you didn't)\nYou can ask E cause he brought her up to see me\nKeith you can't smoke weed, man pass the light\nMy probation thing is gonna be aight! aight!\n\n[Chorus 3X]"}], "artist": "Keith Murray"}
