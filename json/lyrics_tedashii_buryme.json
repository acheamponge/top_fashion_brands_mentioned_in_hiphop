Death, I promise I'm so dead already\nHe changed my batteries and now your boy forever ready\nI'm ever ready\nWhen He get back\nLooked death in the face and told it 'Sit back'\n\n[Verse 4: Tedashii]\nNow go on and sit back\nThis life forever fleeting\nI know you don't believe me\nIt's deceiving we still breathing\nTo perceive it can take a life\nLike playin' with metal toys\nNever make sense like your mind's playin' tricks: Ghetto Boys\nUnless you seek the Lord, and His divine plan\nThen you just watchin' time pass tryin' to rewind sand\nThe hourglass tickin'\nI'm okay I'm in position\nDead to me, alive in Christ\nBury me, watch me live it\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
