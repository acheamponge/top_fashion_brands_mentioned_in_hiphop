I don't know\nI try to trace back every step I took\nI look for your smile but it's somber\nI look in the mirror and I'm conquered\nDo you concur that this is obscure?\nThat the perfectly painted picture is now just a blur\nMy inside gets stirred\nI was so innocent\nNever knew how bad this life could hurt\nAnd that's why I live like a bird\nBut now I just live like a burden\nI was driven by faith and purpose\nNow I hitchhike cause I'm afraid to make a wrong turn\n\n[Hook x2]\nSo resurrect me\nOh won't you resurrect me\n'Cause I think I'm dead\nAnd if not I'm dying\nBring me back to life\n\n[Outro]\nBring me back to life\nResurrect me\nBring me back to life\nResurrect me\nCause I think I'm dead\nAnd if not I'm dying\nTo bring me back to life\nCause I think I'm dead\nAnd if not I'm dying\nTo bring me back to life", "year": null, "album": "Weapon Aid"}], "artist": "Braille"}
