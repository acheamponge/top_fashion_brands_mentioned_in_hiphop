Streets", "lyrics": "Yeah\nUhhh\n\n[Foxy]\nAyo fo real\nIt's time for everybody\nTo get they muthafuckin' minds right\nCause it's about to go down\nStraight like that\nOooh\nUhhh\nKid Capri\nIll Na Na\nAnd the muthafuckin' L-O-X\nThat's right\n\nChorus (Styles)\n\nFrom the top of New York, where they be poppin' they corks\nFrom the bottom of the slums, where they be poppin' they guns\nNiggas that rock whips and get plenty of one's\nBut niggas goin' hand and hand, are havin' to run\nThe niggas that had cake and got sent up state\nFor the mother who lost a child and had to set up a wake\nFor those who swan about the ghetto, but don't know how to skate\nGuess you gotta live the life just keep the faith\n\n[Sheek]\nAye yo, aye yo\nOur shit contagious, so ya'll niggas try to quaratine us\nYa'll niggas shook up, and all that like Orangina's\nMy gun American, but my niggas got foreign nina's\nSix cars between us, laced out\nHalf my money from the drug route, ya know how that goes\nWe hung in heavy metal clubs, and slung shit for the nose\nIt's Sheek Luchion, either at the bar with a groupie on\nMy python, gettin' sex\nIn hotels with connected the rooms\nFill letter walk through on his ex\nJadakiss and Styles smoke a pound up through a storm\nRoom service, bring 'em champagne with five matts on\nFrom most hated, to heavy rotated, forget it\nNext stop is movies, ya'll check it when Blockbuster get it\nCheap-skates, sweatin' off Capri's pre-release dates\nFor Money, Power & Respect, went platnuim out the gates\nFrom Rusell Simmons to Puff, Lox and DMX got this\nBig time, we probably shoot this joint up on tropics\nWhen we eat fish like whiteies\nAnd bitches have on nighties\nSuckin' dick, me I'm on some jail shit\nStanding up, jerkin' off, while these hoes eat each others clits\n(Yuh heard me)\n\nChorus (Styles)\n\nFrom the top of New York, where they be poppin' they corks\nFrom the bottom of the slums, where they be poppin' they guns\nNiggas that rock whips and get plenty of one's\nBut niggas goin' hand and hand, are havin' to run\nThe niggas that had cake and got sent up state\nFor the mother who lost a child and had to set up a wake\nFor those who swan about the ghetto, but don't know how to skate\nGuess you gotta live the life just keep the faith\n\n[Foxy Brown]\nUhh, uhh\nBet I salute all chicks that be gettin' them chips\nThrow it up, for my bitches, that be poppin' that Crist'\nSpecially to the one's, who be ridin' that dick\nAnd if the pussy bangin', hope it cop to a stick\nAnd all my thorough chicks, who cried and lied for these cats\nOut of town, on a hound for these cats\nIf shit got thick, let off rounds for these cats\nIn the crocodle Prada, stash the pound for these cats\nMe and my bitches got down for these cats\nPaid our dues, for 62's, taped to the thigh\nSeen the truth through the lie, but the bullshit aside\nLike a trooper, I put that on my life that I ride\nConspiracy charge, straight copped out to 3-5\nWhat fuck am I to do, suffer and die\nMaximum 25, baby fuck if I fry\nIt's a ditry game, when it come to slingin' them thangs\nBail like a hundered-thou, but the us is more change\nShit, I used to trick that from jewels and the rings, huh\n\nChorus (Styles)\n\nFrom the top of New York, where they be poppin' they corks\nFrom the bottom of the slums, where they be poppin' they guns\nNiggas that rock whips and get plenty of one's\nBut niggas goin' hand and hand, are havin' to run\nThe niggas that had cake and got sent up state\nFor the mother who lost a child and had to set up a wake\nFor those who swan about the ghetto, but don't know how to skate\nGuess you gotta live the life just keep the faith\n\n[Styles]\nPrayer one, for niggas that be bustin' they gun\nTill the death, what'd you expect for a couple of one's\nPrayer two, for niggas that ain't ever had shit\nMasked up, blacked down, go on and grab shit\nPrayer three, for niggas on lock without a key\nThat ain't never comin' home, but you know how it be\nLivin' to die, but niggas ain't willin' to die\nIf you bust up in the air, you ain't killin' the sky\nFeelin' the high, nigga is you willin' to lie\nYou a crumb and you dumb, you ain't stealin' the pie\nI leave a bloody mess, nigga bigger then me, cut his neck\nLox brothers, ya'll niggas is cock-suckers\nYellow belly cowards, I want Money and the Power\nAssassin, you think it's a joke, you'll die laughing\nHoppin' out the plane, and only bringing the captain\nStart of a legacy, her heart broke down and start beggin' me\nDog I'm a whole different pedigree\nTake me to the limit, I'm layin' in the cut\nWhile you playin' in the scrimage\nMeet you at the final\nLyrically, I'm spiritually, drunker then a whino\nPosion, house full of rhyme\nBring your boys in\nTell 'em take it easy, have a seat on the couch\nI'm the govenor, ya'll bitch niggas is crouts\nTake orders, yuh need passports at the border\nWe transporting water, shit was flawed\nFell sick took a hit, but we wasn't the cure\nMake your ear-drums pop, bottom lip drop\nEyes switch up, knees hit the floor by the time he spits up\nNobody gets up\n\nMuthafuckas\nL-O-X muthafucka\nL-O-X, try this shit\n\nChorus (with ad-libs)\n\nFrom the top of New York, where they be poppin' they corks\nFrom the bottom of the slums, where they be poppin' they guns\nNiggas that rock whips and get plenty of one's\nBut niggas goin' hand and hand, are havin' to run\nThe niggas that had cake and got sent up state\nFor the mother who lost a child and had to set up a wake\nFor those who swan about the ghetto, but don't know how to skate\nGuess you gotta live the life just keep the faith"}]}
