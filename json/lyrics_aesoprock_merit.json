You feel that?\nA maverick like myself bottles, will quit 'til the cocoon naturally peels back\nThis little light of mine shines at a hundred billion times the magnitude of every star\nWithin an ample sky sample\nI alerted\nMy sole crusaders\nTo trade the games;\nPrescribed them strict diets of DDT and Kelthane\nIt fester when ingested\nGlorious vellum\nAddressing helots to zealots\nTo Jezebel's to hellish felons\nGranted my span of attention is not what it used to be\nBut most of y'all delinquents ain't amusing me no more, kid, merit", "title": "Merit", "album": "Music for Earthworms", "image": "https://images.genius.com/355a2e1156bc79b1e8d0997024f4cc06.300x302x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
