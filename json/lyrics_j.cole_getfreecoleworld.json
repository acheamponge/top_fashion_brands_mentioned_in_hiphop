Listen to the words they have in their lyrics\nAnd tell me is that some real shit\nAnd if that's real shit to you\nYou know what I mean? Listen to what they're saying to you\nDon't just bob your head to the beat peep the game\nAnd listen to what I'm saying & hold us accountable for it"}], "artist": "J. Cole"}
