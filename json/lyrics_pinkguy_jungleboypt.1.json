Fuck.)\nThey call me Mr. Fantastic, ass kicked rapper nasty\nBlasting sticky mass in ass and other fat things\n\"Smoking blunts was a daily routine\"\nAnd that's a bad impression of Biggie\n(But I don't mean any disrespect.)\nYo, I'm so fucking slick that Slick Ricky would slit his wrist\nAnd insist that I should be the slickest bitch since the genesis \"Since the genesis?\" Yeah, since the genesis\nCause I'm the bestestest at good grammar in these sentences (Fucking idiot.)\nYo, I'm cramming verbs like the SATs, ese please\nI got a really long diss for you I call an essay tease\nYou didn't get the joke so I guess you're a special needs student\nYa'll are fake dicks dildos with no lubricants\nHa, I'm not the brightest man\nBut like the slightest bite of hepatitis can inflate a cell with viral livers\nThat's me, 'cause I'm viral man\n[unintelligible gibberish]\nSo do you feel high?\nI swear I'm fucking with more bonds than Bill Nye\nH 2 the O with stilettos now that's a high tide\nCall me Billy Mays cause I'm still living in 1999", "year": "2014-02-21"}]}
