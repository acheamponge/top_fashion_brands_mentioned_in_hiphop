What?)\nWill I renegotiate my soul to be what I ain't?\nSometimes I question the fact, do I love me or love you?\nOr do I hate myself so much I place none above you\nLogic versus emotion is just a common conflict\nPhysically free but I guess I'm still a mental convict (Hey)"}], "artist": "Denzel Curry"}
