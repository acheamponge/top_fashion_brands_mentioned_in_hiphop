It's the life)\n(Once again it's the life, yes)\nI don't know why, I.. get so high oh\n(It's intoxicating man, y'all don't know why you do what you do)\nGet so high oh, get so high, high off the life\n\n[Verse 1: Jay-Z]\nThe allure of breaking the law\nWas always too much for me to ever ignore\nI've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses\nIn love with a V-Dub engine\nMan, I'm high off life, fuck it, I'm wasted\nBathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist\nMy women-friends get tennis bracelets\nTrips to Venice, get their Winters replaced with\nThe sun...it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded\nMan, it's just a game, I just play it to play it\nI put my feet in the footprints left to me\nWithout saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy\nMan, my brother hustled so, naturally\nUp next was me, but what perplexes me\nShit, I know how this movie ends, still I play\nThe starring role in \"Hovito's Way\"\n\n[Chorus: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]\nIt's just life, I solemnly swear\nTo change my approach, stop shaving coke\nStay away from hoes, put down the toast\n'Cause I be doing the most (OH NO!)\nBut every time I felt \"That was that\", it called me right back\nIt called me right back\nMan, it called me right back (OH NO!)\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nI'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka\nUntil I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real\nPeel the top up like a toup\u00e9e, mix the water with the soda\nTurn the pot up, make a souffl\u00e9\nAll of y'all can get it like group-page on your 2-way\nI'm living proof that crime do pay\nSay \"hooray\" to the bad guy, and all the broads\nPutting cars in their name, for the stars of the game\nPutting 'caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train:\nAll in the name of love\nJust to see that love locked in chains and the family came\nOver the house to take back everything that they claimed\nOr even the worse pain is the distress\nLearning you're the mistress only after that love gets slain\nAnd the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust\nNow it gets tough to ever love again\nBut the allure of the game, keeps calling your name\nTo all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain\nTo all the Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes:\nWe all hustlers in love with the same thing\n\n[Chorus: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]\nIt's just life, I solemnly swear\nTo change my approach, stop shaving coke\nStay away from hoes, put down the toast\n'Cause I be doing the most (OH NO!)\nBut every time I felt \"That was that\", it called me right back\nIt called me right back\nMan, it called me right back (OH NO!)\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nI never felt more alive than riding shotgun\nIn Klein's green 5, until the cops pulled guns\nAnd I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need -\nWhat the game did to my pulse - with no results\nAnd you can treat your nose and still won't come close\nThe game is a light bulb with eleventy-million volts\nAnd I'm just a moth addicted to the floss\nThe doors lift from the floor and the tops come off\nBy any means necessary, whatever the cost\nEven if it means lives is lost\nAnd I can't explain why I just love to get high\nDrink, \"life!\" smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice\nI'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times\nI may not even be alive\nI mean even James Dean couldn't escape the allure\nDying young, leaving a good-looking corpse\nOf course...\n\n[Chorus: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]\nIt's just life, I solemnly swear\nTo change my approach, stop shaving coke\nStay away from hoes, put down the toast\n'Cause I be doing the most (OH NO!)\nBut every time I felt \"That was that\", it called me right back\nIt called me right back\nMan, it called me right back (OH NO!)\n\n[Outro: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]\nOnce again its the life\nYeah I said its the life\nOnce I again its the life\n(OH NO! I don't know why, I...\nGet so high oh\nGet so high oh\nGet so high, high off the life)", "title": "Allure", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/db98dd9c59a51c9b6b76f6d6a32cac9f.991x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2003-11-14", "album": "The Black Album"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
