You are fucking gone\n\n[Verse 1: Cage]\nLet's get this bourbon poured\nPuff some herb indoors\nIf life's a bitch then show her\nWho the fuck she's workin' for\nShe's a perfect whore\nThat little skirt's a score\nLife sucks, so you let her\nFuck you until her cervix is torn\nAnd then a turd is born\nAnother worthless corn\nAlways cunts, assholes and dicks\nAround these words of porn\nIn a perfect storm\nSurface in serpent form\nSent here to eat, shit, fuck, rap, burp and mourn\n\n[Refrain]\nWhy am I so destroyed?\nIt's a distraction\nWhy talk to God?\nI don't even know what to ask him\nLooking for passion\nSomething to bash in\nWith my fists, I'm in need\nOf total satisfaction\n\n[Verse 2: Cage]\nGo for mine and go for yours\nAnd I have no remorse\nThese words are fly\nCause of moth eggs in my vocal cords\nNow what you were hopin' for is\nSmokin' coke in Coors\nCans, bent in half\nTo deal with being broke and poor\nI should focus or\nFind out what this rope is for\nSwing from the rafters\nWith a belly full of croque-monsieur\nThen I'll explode manure\nI closed a broken door\nProve the spirit world exists\nAnd I will go for sure\nOr I could cope some more\nCop a smoke on tour\nThe wormholes in my arms\nFrom doing dope sulfur\nThat shit'll soak the floor\nWhen it leaks like an open sore\nSelf-loathe, self-medicated, self-saboteur\n\n[Refrain]\nWhy am I so destroyed?\nIt's a distraction\nWhy talk to God?\nI don't even know what to ask him\nLooking for passion\nSomething to bash in\nWith my fists, I'm in need\nOf total satisfaction\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I'm so paranoid\nWhat's the attraction?\nI'm seeing shit that you\nCouldn't even imagine\n\n[Refrain]\nWhy am I so destroyed?\nIt's a distraction\nWhy talk to God?\nI don't even know what to ask him\nLooking for passion\nSomething to bash in\nWith my fists, I'm in need\nOf total satisfaction\n\n[Outro]\nThis movie makes me what to fuck doggy style and cut a woman's head off.  But the difference is is that I would fuck her neck wound.  You fuck right up her trachea, right where the blood is gushing out, it's like a lubricant.  That's what I want\u2026 to do"}]}
