This shit getting serious\nAin\u2019t no time for busted lips, the shit I bust will turn you bitch\nTurn your back and walk away, keep on thinking that you safe\nIt\u2019s a small world after all, so I\u2019ll just wait until that day\nTo pull my heat and lay you out or grab my blade and start to scalp\nEither way I do not doubt the sweet revenge keeps me around\nSilently right on your trail, if you live only time will tell\nI\u2019ll be there though if you ain\u2019t, so you can see we here to stay\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll my warriors get loud; make some room up in this crowd\nLet everyone else around; see how killers put shit down\nPull it out and let it pop, listen to those bodies drop\nLet them all lay their in shock, at least now they know we don\u2019t play\nEverybody recognize I\u2019m not the type to tell you twice\nFuck with me, I guarantee that someone going pay the price\nShow respect when in the room, I\u2019m killing all that I see though\nIf you ever did me wrong, then I hope to see you soon\n\n[Chorus x4]", "year": "2008-11-25"}]}
