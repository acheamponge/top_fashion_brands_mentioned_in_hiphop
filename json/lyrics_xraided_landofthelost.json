Where can I go?  What can I say?\nI'm in the Land, of the Lost, with no escape\n\nChorus:\n\nStuck in a whirlpool gettin' drug down\nWe was four deep but I'm the only one now\nHow long will I last before I fall off?\nRunnin', for my life, in the land of the lost\nStuck in a whirlpool gettin' drug down\nWe was four deep but I'm the only one now\nHow long will I last before I fall off?\nRunnin', for my life, in the land of the lost\n\nSecond Verse:\n\nChristmas missed us again\nPoppa robbed 7-11 so now he sittin' in the pen\nAin't no presents up under the tree for me\nNo toys to enjoy, cuz Mama's unemployed\nYour boy had to face reality at an early age\nStepDad beatin' on Mama cuz he had a bad day\nThe drama was thicker than Hill Street Blues\nWanted to get a .22 and buck him, so you can see it on the news\nNow my shoes was holey, pants was old\nBirthdays was fucked up, all I got was clothes\nA lil' Bebe kid, young Pro-Wing sporter boy\nWearin' turtlenecks, and thick-ass corduroys\nNever got along in Junior High, got bagged on, beat down\nHoes laughed at me\nBut I tried to be cool, I tried to fit in\nBut then I said \"Fuck it!\"\nAnd started comin' to school with a Mack-10\nGot a nigga for his Nikes and his Starter coat\nI got another for his bike, got another for his loccs\nRobbed the same 7-11 as Poppa\nI went and bought a coat down, and some khaki suits, now I'm proper\nBlocc ah-, filliated at only fourteen\nI'm doin' what I want and can't nobody say a thing\nAnd it seems like I'm out of control\nI don't know where I'm headed, the Land of the Lost got my soul\n\nChorus\n\nThird Verse:\n\nMy Mama said there would be days like these\nThe Ghetto on my back beatin' me down to my knees\nDisease, infected\nChildren, neglected\nEverywhere I look, I don't see nothin' but crooks\nI rejected, the knowledge that my Mama tried to give\nI told her \"It's my life and I'm the one that's gotta live\"\nMistaken prone, thinkin' I'm grown, doin' whatever I wanna\nNigga's on his own, all alone, no one in my corner\nI got a job at Dairy Queen servin' double burgers\nMoonlightin' as a Bloccer servin' double murders\nMy first check was only fifty bucks\nSo fuck Dairy Queen, I got back on my the scene\nAnd stacked some real green\nBut opportunies is limited, it's either sell drugs or fast food\nAnd you know which one I choose\nCuz it's win, lose, or draw, in sickness, in health\nIt's [1.5 second pause] represent the turf\nCuz don't nobody else give a fuck\nThe only love I ever felt, came from the homies and myself\nI want wealth, and power, no matter what the cost\nThat's all that's on my mind, in the Land, of the Lost\n\nChorus\n\nStuck in the whirlpool...."}], "artist": "X-Raided"}
