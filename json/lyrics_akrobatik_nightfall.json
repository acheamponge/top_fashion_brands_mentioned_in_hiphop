Cause unecessarily we be dyin\nNowadays you get killed over which shorty you eyin\nThe moonlight effects my people kind of like the werewolf\nNow every nigga think he John Wilkes Booth\nBut despite the decreased visibility\nI maintain the ability to possess mental agility\nSo I ain't on the block lookin for Jake\nI'm at the crib tryin to get my girl to stop watchin \"Ricki Lake\"\n\"As The World Turns,\" one fact burns\nEvery 24 hours, night fall returns (what?), nightfall\n\n[Hook - Akrobatik]\nLet me tell you about the nightfall (nightfall) - 2X\n\nWhen night falls, we parlayin under street lights\nWhen night falls, the knuckleheads be lookin for the fights\nIn the ghetto it seems, shit never goes right\nWhen night falls, when night falls\n\nWhen night falls, your whole state of mind can change\nWhen night fallsm the most normal shit be lookin strange\nHonor roll students, they be actin deranged\nWhen night falls, when night falls, what?\n\nLet me tell you about the nightfall\nLet me tell you about the nightfall (nightfall)", "title": "Nightfall", "album": "Essential Akrobatik Vol. 1"}], "artist": "Akrobatik"}
