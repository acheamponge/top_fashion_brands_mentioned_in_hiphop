Bypass\nI mastered (What?), the treasurer of gettin' ass\nWhip Aston, red pipe and leather, slick nasty\nSassy (Shoot), but at the same time raspy\nPlug me a thug, your mother eatin' plaster\n\n[Verse 3: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nStyles will change, they say change is dang\u2013\nErous as a King standing on the terrace\nWhile his partner pointing up at the riflemen\nCoward shooter, never know when your life will end\nThen live like there ain't no 'morrow\nAnd if one come, then this the motto\nNow I put message in bottle\nYou go to the nearest beach and open your car door\nAnd walk to the place where the sea meets the land\nYeah, it's easier to run the street than walk in the sand\nHey, I'm talkin', young man, as if chalk in my hand\nI will take y'all little ass to school\nIt's cool when the kids call me Sunny, the hood calls me Stacks\nThe B's call me honey, Hollywood calls me back\nCrack and I have a lot in common\nWe both come up in the 80's and we keep that bass pumpin'\nThat's a nega\u2013tive comparison, embarrassin'\nUnfortunate that if you come up fortunate\nThe streets consider you lame\nHa, I thought the name of the game was to have a better life\nI guess it ain't, what a shame\nI don't slang, never slung, but I'm one with the slum\nThat has a name well fitting, plenty cheese getting\nNo wonder why they call it the trap, so watch your tail\nAnd I'm not kidding, the rats and mice would give advice\nThey say, \"You can paint and draw, get out of here\nGo show them that we're more than slangin' raw\"\nThat's when I broke into my Big Rube impression\nAnd I tried to enlighten but that night I learned a lesson\nThat the morals that you think you got, go out the window\nWhen all the other kids are fresh and they got new Nintendo Wiis\nAnd your child is down on her knees\nPraying hard up to God for a Whopper with cheese\nDo you B, hit the street hard with a flair?\nOr do you A, go to school for heatin' and air?\nDare make an honest livin' or make a crooked killin'\nOr do a bit of both until you're holdin' on a million?\nBrilliant, you got one foot in, one foot out\nYou put your left foot back in and then you shake it all about\nYou do the hokey pokey 'til you turn your life around\nThat's what it's all about, 3000 out", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a6a7427bcd0ec46dc1c163830a552f31.1000x992x1.jpg", "year": "2008-03-24", "title": "Royal Flush", "album": null}]}
