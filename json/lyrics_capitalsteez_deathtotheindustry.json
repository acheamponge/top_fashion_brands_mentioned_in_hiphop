Stay tuned\n\n[Verse: Capital STEEZ]\nBased down, 8th loud with amazing sounds\nPeep the last joint I told you I'm gone make them proud\nTell them other cats we got a hurricane in town\nThought Hip-Hop was dead, now we breaking grounds\nZombies where my heart beats march free\n? now we don't raise harm, we raise arms calmly\nAnd sound waves like tsunamis\nSure hits, fuck Billboard hits\nI don't need to go Diamond to spit raw shit\nI don't need blood diamonds to feel more rich\nJust for kicks, if you shining I'll steal your kicks\nSo who gonna stop us if poverty can't\nThen gives us time [?]\nOr at least recognize me as a quality man\nI got drive, niggas couldn't walk a mile in these Vans\nWordplay needed first aid\nSo good with the verbs it was almost seamless\nRealized I was a genius\nAnd stopped giving a fuck 'bout my third grade teacher\nThey said I lack the pedigree\nBut degree of penmanship I'm shitting on the industry\nSo homie what you telling me\nIt's power to the trinity and death to the industry"}]}
