Cos I'm on to the streets\nBlood, sweat and tears, hustle hard for the green\nOr for a second chance cos it's not fuckin' free\nSo I take a bigger step like Godzilla feet\n\nMy kind of jungle, concrete\nNot anyone that could survive these raw streets\nI stand my ground, strong roots like palm trees\nHow could we be good when everything is not clean?!\nThe only time I could right my wrongs\nIs on a paper just to write a song\nNo father figure to show me how\nOr what to do.. When times get hard. Preach!\n\n[Hook Young Noble]\n\nThe little hommies never got a second chance\nThe big hommies never got a second chance\nMy enemies never got a second chance\nThese young niggas never got a second chance", "album": "Divine Genesis", "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/381efa5c53b0545940357400ece68b6f.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young Noble"}
