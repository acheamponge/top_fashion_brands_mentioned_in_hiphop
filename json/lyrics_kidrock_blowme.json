Crusty\nBecause to face me you must be blitzed or blasted\nSo now I'm going to drop you like a hit of acid\nAnd when I rip you people they might stare\nBecause I got more rhymes than Donahue's got white hair\nAnd yo buck won't you please be a friend\nAnd tell your mom I want to fuck and I'll pick her up at 10"}]}
