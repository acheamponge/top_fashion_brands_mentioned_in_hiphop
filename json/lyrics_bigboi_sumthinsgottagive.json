{"artist": "Big Boi", "songs": [{"lyrics": "It's funny right? They say things done change\nNo more messages in the music, record sales down, gas prices up\nNo more love in your love, no more love for your love\nChange is long overdue, Mary, something's gotta give, Big Boi\n\nYou can trot around the planet or watch it on the news\nSombody's getting shot, the weather man's looking confused\nHe's reporting to a nation full of zombies strung out on starbucks\nAnd stitched up and bitching Abercrombie\n\nUh, don't get it mixed up me too\nI have insomnia at times but don't be walkin' 'round here blind\nNigga feelin' all around, trying to find a righteous path\nIt's appealin' when I rhyme\n\nSo everytime I hit the masses, you know the common folk\nBlue collared day to day workers\nThat squeeze a dollar so they baby can swallow\nA little not a lota just enough to fill that bottle\n\nBut it's a million dollars a gallon for some gas to get to work\nTomorrow that's if you gotta get it, you can't swim in carpool\nYou Rob Peter to pay Paul to make due\nMake you wanna write a note and take a pistol to that bank too\nAnd pass it to the teller but you know better\n\nThey trying to tell us to stay strong\nBut every day we losing jobs\nFrom College Park out to Beverly Hills\nSomethin's gonna have to give\n\nAcross the world they live in fear\nBut it's the same thing over here\nIf you can hear me on Capitol Hill\nSomethin's gonna have to give\n\nThe great debators debate about who's the greatest MC\nSubject matter don't matter because the verse is empty\nNo food for thought nothing for the brain to digest\nSo I guess it'd be about who can bullshit the best\n\nBut I give them light on like the traffic I direct\nInspiring their life like they was actors on my set\nAs if I was a pilot, take 'em higher than a jet\nI'd be a liar if I wasn't sick and tired of this mess\n\nThey trying to tell us to stay strong\nBut every day we losing jobs\n(Everyday, everyday)\nFrom College Park out to Beverly Hills\nSomethin's gonna have to give\n(Give it up y'all)\n\nAcross the world they live in fear\nBut it's the same thing over here\n(Over here, yeah)\nIf you can hear me on Capitol Hill\nSomethin's gonna have to give\n(Oh, yeah)\n\nSingle mother in a struggle and it's no fun\nBut you don't really understand until you are one\nA child is sick and is losing his endurance\nShe want to fix him but she 'ain't got no insurance\n\nNow we don't even want to talk about the man's life\nOut on parol with the promise that he'll do right\nBut a felon has no chance for a new start\nSo it's back to doing hand in hand on his own block\n\nAnd blacks and whites, we're all the same and I know you feel my pain\nAnd the only hope I have to help me deal with the drama\nIs that maybe in November I'll be cheering for Obama\n\nThey trying to tell us to stay strong\n(Yeah)\nBut everyday we losing jobs\n(Every day)\nFrom College Park out to Beverly Hills\n(Ooh)\nSomethin's gonna have to give\n(Give it up, give it up)\n\nAcross the world they live in fear\nBut it's the same thing over here\n(Over here)\nIf you can hear me on Capitol Hill\n(Listen to me now)\nSomething's gonna have to give\n(Give it up y'all)\n\nThe world is too big\nFree your mind or be stuck like porcupine left behind\nThat's the bottom line, gotta find the grind\n'Cause the time won't be coming back around, get it now nigga\n\nThe world is too big\nStep on the stars while you're reaching for the sun\nBut never burn a bridge, each one, teach one\nIf you lend a helping hand, you may never be one\n\nThe world is too big\nAnd I heard him say that every man, woman\nAnd child was gonna be okay\nI heard him say that they would bring\nOur soldiers home in one piece today\n\nThe world is too big\nBut it's not that way\nThey've been selling us a dream\nTelling us we on the same team\nNow we all gotta deal with the lies\n\nThey trying to tell us to stay strong\n(Yeah)\nBut everyday we losing jobs\n(Every day)\nFrom College Park out to Beverly Hills\nSomethin's gonna have to give\n(Have to give)\n\nAcross the world they live in fear\n(Oh yeah)\nBut it's the same thing over here\n(Over here)\nIf you can hear me on Capitol Hill\n(I know you hear me)\nSomethin's gonna have to give\n(Yeah)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6ab5c816aabfeaaf6d9419aff7e1e84c.1000x563x1.jpg", "year": null, "title": "Sumthin\u2019s Gotta Give", "album": null}]}
