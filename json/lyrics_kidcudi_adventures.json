How could I care?\nHow could I care?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd we're floating out to nowhere\nNo safety, fall, we'll land safely\n\n[Verse 2]\nLost in my reflection, how do I chill?\nOnly crazy makes sense, it's starting to make sense\nWhile I'm still\nHer vagina is moist and warm\nI'll keep you safe, just hold my arm\nHell is beyond the door\nHeaven doesn't want one more\nNo more chicken sandwiches\nYes, I'll pay for the damages\nI explore through the galaxy nightly, numb my body\nAccept yourself, except yourself\nExit yourself, access yourself\n\n[Outro]\nNo safety, fall, we'll end safely\nInadequate, he is so unwanted\nMake him want to disappear\nNo safety, fall, we'll end safely\n\n[Skit: Beavis and Butthead]\n\"That song was kinda freaking me out, Butthead. 'And we're floating out in nowhere...'\"\n\"No safety, fall, we will land safely, Beavis.\"\n\"Kind of makes me think about my life, you know?\n\"What life?\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, exactly. The part, you know, 'we're floating out in nowhere...'\"\n\"Don't worry, Beavis, we will land safely.\"\n\"How come you're talking like that, Butthead?\"\n\"Like what?\"\n\"Come on, stop it.\"\n\"I'm not talking any differently than I normally talk, Beavis. Take some of these mushrooms that Cudi gave us, they'll make you feel better.\"\n\"Stop talking like that, Butthead.\"\n\"Like what, Beavis?\"\n\"You're freaking me out.\"\n\"Take some mushrooms, Beavis. Take some.\"\n\"Oh boy, these mushrooms suck. But they're fast acting, aren't they? These taste horrible.\"\n\"Eat them all, Beavis.\"\n\"They're doing something. Give me some more.\"\n\"Come with me, Beavis, to burning, man. Take some.\""}]}
