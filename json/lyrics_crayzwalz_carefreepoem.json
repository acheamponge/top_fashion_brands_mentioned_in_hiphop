Right?  Y\u2019all don\u2019t even know what this shit...  Don\u2019t fucking talk...\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nDoes life breathe an elixir over blessing and the bothered at once\nWhether you the [?] that makes the band or get punked.  What?\nI held it down.  A lot of dumb shit to put up with\nThe topic is: Fuck That.  Matter of fact, fuck this\nThese ladies be off-the-chain, hook hinges in frame\nWe\u2019re crazy.  Lost in lane, I\u2019ll be the boss\nTake blame.  Dead buzzards marked your soul as you worked\nThat pole.  Forget birth, earth.  You need self-worth\nControl (Damn).  I was fucking those bitches, looking for more riches\nCouldn\u2019t tell them my face when my whole bank account was in stitches\nRolling an L in the crib, I start collecting the kid\nNeglecting what is, I start reflecting again\nShould I trust in friends who lust in sin?\nThen send freakish gusts of wind that\u2019ll scuff your Timbs?\nKnock boost like the doors of the haunted house\nWho knows what followed you out\u2014like\nWhat about that dude you think drugged you?  Stop by\nFor a drink.  Fifteen hours later, you\u2019re just about to come to\nYou better prepare \u2018cause what you asked for is\nDangerous like riding through Iraq with American passports\nBreathe"}]}
