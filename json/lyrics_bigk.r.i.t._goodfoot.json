What you know about the hard knock\nOld school time machine\nFrom the light to hard top\nNo tears, see my face, ho?\nI've been passed you, what you pumping your brakes for?\nChill! And stay the fuck out of the mix\nCause niggas ain't real\nAnd hoes ain't shit\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Big K.R.I.T."}
