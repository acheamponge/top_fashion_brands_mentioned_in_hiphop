lonely\nSo I keep my mind on knockin' shit off the hinges\n'Cause the hoes don't speakin' since I lost my ends\nAnd bein' mad at the world ain't the thing to be\nBut see the world make me feel it's the thing for me\nSo as a matter of fact, fuck being somethin' else\n'Cause I hustle and I struggle by my goddamn self\nSo what's the way for a young black nigga today?\nRob folks and sell dope that's what I figured you'd say\nA nigga wanna put his thang down day-by-day\n'Cause my daddy gave me game, nigga play-by-play\nHe said you gotta make money-money\nAnd if they act funny-funny\nThen take money-money-money-money!\n\n[Hook]\nSo if you got somethin' on your mind\nThan make it better than the last time\n(Make it better than the last time)\nPeople pass by, sayin' that they wish me well\nBut in reality I'm knowin' these hoes wish me hell\nShit we design to blow your goddamn mind\nWas made better than the last time\n(Made better than the last time)\nPeople pass by, sayin' that they wish me well\nBut in reality I'm knowin' these hoes wish me hell\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow can your mind picture me, passin' out from the heat\nWhen it's 20 degrees, full of that gin anger\nLeave my

make it hustlin' steady\n'Bout my guns [?]\nToss it if you let me, Young Maxminelli\nThey tell me playa-haters wish you the worst\nBut I got fire and I spit first\nHello hearse nigga, no more thirst nigga\nNo more times, see get your game on the level of mind and we could grind\n'Cause when the world on fire all the weed goin' blow\nAnd when you take your last charge you sho' don't know\nNow take

can't even get no drawers\nReady to wrap my paws 'round the wheels of a Land Cruiser\nRoll with a clique full of straight savage ass pistol shooters\nWanna walk up in the club with a grip and a hoe\nSo cold and grab the mic and turn that bitch into a icicle\nSo what's the worst if I wasn't taught\nHow to upgrade my game and give get a glimpse of life and live it\nGive or take a couple a years and we gon' floss\nSo eat a dick from the next nigga in line to be boss though\nI still contact playa-haters on the regular\nBut layin' low, motherfuckers always ahead of ya\nThey makes me feel like I got no brain\nThey wanna snatch me out the game, man, they best to be [?]\nBut they must be out they goddamn mind\nShit we design to blow your mind was made better than the last time\n\n[Hook]\nSo if you got somethin' on your mind\nThan make it better than the last time\n(Make it better than the last time)\nPeople pass by, sayin' that they wish me well\nBut in reality I'm knowin' these hoes wish me hell\nShit we design to blow your goddamn mind\nWas made better than the last time\n(Was made better than the last time)\nPeople pass by, sayin' that they wish me well\nBut in reality I'm knowin' these hoes wish me hell\n\n[Verse 4]\nConjunction, conjuction, nigga what's your malfunction?\nBlowin' at you me while you rollin', ain't not future in your frontin'\nLet me chill (chill), and sag (sag) and smoke what's left off in this bag\nAnd get bionic as the chronic let me be and let my pants drag\nI walked the world and glamor girls like a pimp\n[?] me for mobsters, eatin' lobster and shrimp\nThey can't stop me, Mexican bitches call me papi (sloppy)\nLike that y'all, but still a killer comin' at y'all (nigga, huh!)\nHear me say what now, with Maxminelli on the cellular-telly\nHollerin' bout \"Mail me my money mane\"\nConfetti (\"You heard me\")\nInternational players, runnin' the game world wide\nCoolest [?] with a bunny-rabbit on my side, right?\nHoppin' up for the downstroke, while they Pappy play the fiddle\nBitches giggle, shakin' ass til it jiggles\nRecitin' my riddles for kibbles, female dogs that blow your mind\nBut redesign that shit trick and play it \"better than the last time\"", "album": "My Balls and My Word", "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/1613c69d81c9bbfbbbbe477f2130bb6f.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young Bleed"}
