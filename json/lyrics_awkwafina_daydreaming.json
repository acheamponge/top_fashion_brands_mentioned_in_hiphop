Uh\n\n[Verse 2]\nChris Christie, you's a man beast\nI love it when you yelling at me on the TV\nWith yo white shirt,  is that a taco stain?\nI'll give you cookies if you promise that I'll get laid\nBitch show me the world, or just Jersey\nWe could make Teaneck so dirty\nAnd I don't blame you, for the Bridgegate\nCause you are still the governor of my mid-range\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that\nWhat I would do with a man like that?\nYo, I'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that\nWhat I would do with a man like that? Uh\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo Sinbad, where you been at?\nI wrote you messages I even sent a sext fax\nI want to hold you in a hot tub\nTell you my fears while you givin' me a back rub\nI wouldn't throw a fit, if you was my house guest\nJust know that I will put that D on house arrest\nIn a different world, we will be lovers\nWe could have a foursome with Urkel and Sally Struthers\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that\nWhat I would do with a man like that?\nYo, I'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that\nWhat I would do with a man like that? Uh\n\nI'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that\nWhat I would do with a man like that?\nYo, I'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that\nWhat I would do with a man like that? Uh\n\nI'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that\n\nI'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that\n\nUh", "year": "2014-11-18"}]}
