Nah, I don't need those\nGive me an iPod and my bars will make you say, \"My God!\"\nAt least I thought until some dogs bark\nStartled, but I laugh it off. Look back at the passing cars\nThen to make it better I trip on the slanted sidewalk\nWow, SMH!\nThen the shame fades away jamming to the bass\nAt the stoplight, dancing like I'm trying to get the spotlight\nPeople know if I don't have headphones, something's not right\nWalk light comes on, I check both ways\nDrivers see me lip syncing to every single song that plays\nI don't care if they claim that that boy cray\nCause I know those who wave would agree when I say\nI-\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3 - Wax]\nYou can catch me on a playground swing\nBack and forth smilin' doing my thing\nPassers-by often color me dumb\nBut I don't care man, I'm comfortably numb\nThey looking at me real strangely\nBut their perceptions don't change me\nI bet if I jumped at the right trajectory\nI'd fly right over them and land in a special seat\nOn the crest of the moon with a fishing pole\nCast in the earth in some distant hole\nPull up a catfish I wouldn't gut it\nI would play with it, and love it\nI'm sorry for the hole that spanned your lip\nA small price for good old companionship\nLoneliness is a mountain, a massive climb\nI'm on the other side, happy, just passing time\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f3b1128cd10401c7ba2b36c8cfb02999.700x700x1.jpg", "album": "The People\u2019s Mixtape Vol. 2: The Wish List", "title": "Don\u2019t Need (Remix)"}]}
