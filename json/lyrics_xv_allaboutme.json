(2x)\nI...Fuck it (Unh)\n\n[Verse 1]\nSee I gotta be this blunt (Unh)\nCause that's all that these chicks want\nHoff's never mixed up\nNever diamond studded a wrist up\nAnd get brunch, I hit three times an skipped lunch\nYou get once\nSchoolboy gave me a little advice\n\"If you fucked her once, you can fuck her twice\"\nHe forgot to tell me that these bitches fuck for hype\nSo get fucking paid and you can fuck all night\nThat's the recipe\nHope this tape don't make you think less of me\nI said that to my baby girl especially\nShe said don't ever let the game get the best of me\nSo I've been holding back the album until they mess with me\nCause soon as I drop it they gon' Freshman me\nUnless it mean a million dollar check to me, no sleep\nSave the rest for you cause it's all about me"}], "artist": "XV"}
