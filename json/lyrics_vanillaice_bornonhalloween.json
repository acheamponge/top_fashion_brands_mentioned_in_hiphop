Please allow me to introduce\nThe Duke of the Wicked\nThe one and only... Violent J!\n\n[Verse 3: Violent J from Insane Clown Posse]\nI was born disfigured\nDisgruntled and discombobulated\nIn the back of a brothel\nJust before it got raided\nI didn't open up my eyes until the eve of Halloween\nSome tough they've never seen mad\nI howled and screamed\nI bit somebody's finger off\nThey threw me in a dumpster\nUnderneath the colored packs of trash\nA little monster, raised in the alleys\nEating possums and rats\nYet every Halloween I seen\nI could completely relax\nI can walk the streets freely\nWielding a machete\nLeave a body on the lawn\nCut open bleedin' out spaghetti\nNobody know about me\nAnd then I lurk up in the gutters\nIt's wicked, everyday for me\nIt's a costume for these others\nWe don't want your nutty butters and suckas\nV.Ice and violent J born on Halloween\nThey can't touch us\n\n[Hook: Insane Clown Posse]\n\n[Outro: Insane Clown Posse]\nBorn on Halloween (x12)", "album": "WTF", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7206499400c5efe587f72ed323df0b11.846x828x1.jpg"}]}
