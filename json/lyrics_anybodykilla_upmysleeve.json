Hey, something's lurking, staring right at you\nI can feel your souls been waiting to let all my spirits through\nSo many faces on my spin\nWords I write, remembering\nAll these legends that we speak\nStories told, draw minds in deep\nWho can face the blackest cloud\nWhen lightening strikes on solid ground\nWho will be left, to see the mist\nOf afterlife, and happiness\nUp my sleeve, there's so many things\nWho knows what this killer brings?\nHypnotized, inside your mind\nBut still you can't see me\n\n(Chorus)\nHere I go again, another check\nNobody knows what the fuck I'm after\nNow you see me now you can't, disappear\nWhy you think ABK is so weird?\nBut fuck that, I got warrior skills!\nI can vanish like that, *snap* for real!\nSwoosh Gone! Like a dollar bill\nI'll have you're ass shiverin' with chills\n\n(Break)\nI'm a psycho, going crazy can't seem to get my head straight\nI'll these visions, I keep havin', want to take my breath away\nNon-believers stay alert because this world keeps changing\nUp my sleeve's a remedy, to keep you from decaying\n\n(Chorus)\n(Break)\nI'm a psycho, going crazy can't seem to get my head straight\n(CAN'T GET MY HEAD STRAIGHT)\nI'll these visions I keep havin', want to take my breath away\n(TAKE MY BREATH AWAY)\nNon-believers stay alert because this world keeps changing\n(THIS WORLD KEEPS CHANGING)\nUp my sleeve's a remedy, to keep you from decaying\n(Keep you from decaying...)", "year": "2005-03-22"}]}
