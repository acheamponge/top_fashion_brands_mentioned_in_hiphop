You get blinded\n\n[Abstract Rude:]\nFeel an eclipse\nThat energy shifts\nThe wind is so brisk\nIt'll push a man over the cliff\n\nBeginning with this\nThe word that was born with the fist\nAbsorbing the lands and\nFlesh torn with the death wish\n\nWe ain't gotta get violent to communicate\nWe ain't gotta see eye to eye to mobilize and motivate\n\nDeath before dishonor\nEnvy or betrayal\nNever gon' be stronger than we were\nThe day that we were all together\nSpike the nail in the coffin\n'cuz they say you better off and\nOn the other side when you ain't got no problems\n\nI ain't sayin' heavens gate is callin'\nIt don't take death to dodge 'em\n'Cuz you're alive\nYou may as well think of a better option\n\nLet's get you rounded with a spiritual base\nSo you can look in the mirror and be proud of your face\nA real image don't know how to be fake\nMake it by any means or behind the scenes view of the outtakes\n\nI lived in a time of raising hell\nI lived in a time of LL\nAt Def Jam\nI lived in a time\nOf champions of rhyme\nLike Myka motha' fuckin' 9\nAnd X Clan\nI lived in a time of Kool Moe\nI lived in a time of Native Tongues\nAnd Hiero\nAnd who could forget the Wu though\nAnd who rep the west?\nMy crew Project Blowed\n\nA thousand nations\nEven our own\nDescend upon us\n\nNo man is prophet\nNot a single break\nOr chink in armor\n\nOur wounded and dead\nGot fox and vultures feedin' on 'em\nOur movement is lead\nProtect the culture\nKeep it goin'\n\nEn garde\nFor every push\nWhen they come hard\nIt's shields up\nFrom the arrow barrage\nThat builds up\nFrom one bar to the next\nFor every bar you take a text\nI got another thought to digest\n\nI Rock Dis Funky Joint\n'cuz Funky Town's the livest\nAnd you missin' the point\nYou digress I guess\n\nBut I got something going\nWith my little KTF\nMy crew\nIs right on the brink\nOf being The Dark Knight Rises\n\nA terror in the air\nA bearer of bad news\nYour era is in jeopardy\nSo be scared of Ab Rude\n\nCan't get me out your head\nMy nightmare has you\nBut you'll never be aware\n'cuz to you only cash rules\n\nI lived in a time of raising hell\nI lived in a time of LL\nAt Def Jam\nI lived in a time\nOf champions of rhyme\nLike Myka motha' fuckin' 9\nAnd X Clan\nI lived in a time of Kool Moe\nI lived in a time of Native Tongues\nAnd Hiero\nAnd who could forget the Wu though\nAnd who rep the west?\nMy crew Project Blowed", "title": "I Lived In A Time", "image": "https://images.genius.com/253e884caab83020713e4ea5d108eba4.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Keep the Feel: A Legacy of Hip Hop Soul", "year": "2014-06-05"}]}
