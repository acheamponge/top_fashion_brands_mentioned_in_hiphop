(8x)\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nWell, I was in the studio\nBut I couldn't hit the notes\nI could've got a vocal coach\nBut I ain't want no vocal coach\nThen someone showed me this plug-in\nSo you can't hear the notes I miss\nSo I don't need no vocalist\nAnd now I got an instant hit\n\n[Verse: B.o.B]\nWassup baby?\nWhen I come through, I'm a boss\nEverything I do I just floss\nAnd you know what I'm doing\nWhen I do it, everything I do is just real\nAnd you know I ain't playing, I'm just saying man\nEverything in my brain is playing\nWhen I'm on the mic I'm blazing\nMan who am I? Just like a super-saiyan\nMan I'm just saying\nWhen I'm in the booth man, I'm never, never playing\nAnd let me just quit it\nWhen I'm on the mic, these lyrics I kick it\nAnd it's so exquisite\nMan I divide up just like digits\nMay I get a witness\nAll up in church on sunday man, give it\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nWell, I was in the studio\nBut I couldn't hit the notes\nI could've got a vocal coach\nBut I ain't want no vocal coach\nThen someone showed me this plug-in\nSo you can't hear the notes I miss\nSo I don't need no vocalist\nAnd now I got an instant hit\n\n[Outro: B.o.B]\nThanks Autotune!", "title": "Autotune", "album": "Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost And Damned EP Special Edition", "image": "https://images.genius.com/31065d0f2149badd2a7c43fe06049908.268x268x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
