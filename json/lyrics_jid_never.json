You a pen king (Kingpin? You a pen king)\nBye, bye, niggas, 'N Sync, try I? Nigga, risky\nFire, fire from the wrist piece, niggas shootin' like the '60s\n\n[Chorus]\nAgain, never been shit, never had shit, never knew shit\nNever out, never do shit, damn\nBut a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn\nNever been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist\nNever had shit, I'ma take\nNever asking, \"Give me this, give me that shit\nGive me everything, nigga, fuck you\u2026\"\n\n[Beat Switch/Interlude]\nUhh, let's go\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah\u2026 yeah, yeah, what, um\nAlright, what you call a chick that don't suck dick? You don't\nAnd if you think you finna come up this, you won't\nDown comes the boogie and up jumps the funk\nThis beat takin' a beating, I hand out the lumps\nDamn, baby, yo' ass stand out in pumps\nThat's outstanding, stand outside until your man come\nOr you can leave with the kid, we can plan something\nYou know I came from the dirt like a sandstorm\nNigga, this a 3 point and-1\nAnd 100, Wilt Chamberlain with the hand dunk\nShawty love JID, let me turn her to a hand puppet\nShe moan, sound like German or something\nRun game, bitches think I'm Todd Gurley or something\nGive me a jersey, I done balled so hard, I caught a hernia\nWheeled yo' bitch out my bed in a gurney\nYou gotta leave lil' mama, the clock's turning\nI hit it first, Ray J or Ron Jeremy\nThey bleed like us so them niggas could never scare me\nNo niggas got more glow than JID, barely scratchin' the fucking surface\nYou need work, you need purpose\nEverybody good, everybody trap perfect\nEverything cool, don't nobody act nervous\nJust ignore the fact that your favorite rap nigga is a sap nigga\nWe don't dap niggas, get the rrrat from the ratchet\nGet the pack out the package\nLil' savage ass, ratchet ass, bastard ass, havin' ass\nRappin' ass, jackin' ass, wait\nFinna blast, green dot, send the cash, pen and pad\nMinivan, been a dad, been with that bullshit, nigga\nI don't wake up to the bull like I usually do\nYoung niggas down the block on the woopty woop\nBetter pray to God they don't shoot at you\nDreams of cleanin' this dirty money out my cuticles\nThen a nigga make the crowd jump like Zoboomafoo\n\n[Outro]\nShit's beautiful, shit's beautiful\nShit's beautiful, shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful"}], "artist": "JID"}
