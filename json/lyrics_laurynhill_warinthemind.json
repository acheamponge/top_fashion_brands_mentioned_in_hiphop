Dominate wisdom\nBe recognized in the system\nOf antichrists'? The majority rules\nIntelligent fools\nP. H. D. 's in illusion, masters of mass confusion\nBachelors of past illusion\nNow who you choosing?\nThe head or the tail?\nThe bloodshed of the male or confidence in the veil?\nConferences at Yale discussing doctrines of Baal\nCausing peoples to fail keeping a third in jail\nHis words nailed everything to the tree\nSevering all of me from all that I use to be\nFormless and void, totally paranoid\nEnjoyed darkness's, Lord keeping me from the sword"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
