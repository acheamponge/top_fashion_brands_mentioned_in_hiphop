(x4)\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen I was younger\nI used to play with play dough\nNow that I'm older\nI still play with play dough\nWe go play basketball in the park\nMy skin is darker than tree bark\nJust when you thought\nWe couldn't get any nicer\nWe go around the place\nLooking for that verginer\nRight when we were about to go to bed\nThis sucker came up and he started to said\n\n[Hook]\nWho the sucker mane, who the sucker mane? (x4)\n\n[Verse 2]\nBack in the hood they call me Salamander\nNow look at me, they call me David\nDirty David, so oh please\nHop off my swag and choke on these nuts\nI run away from police\nLike macaroni\nI'm holding my scrotum\nI used to drink vegetable juice and then I vomit\nSo I drink fruit juice and I vomit\nI once found a dead dog on the road\nI left him there on the road\nYou want to know why? because we stir-fry\nHe came up and we started to said\n\n[Hook]\nWho the sucker mane, who the sucker mane? (x4)\n\nNo? OK", "year": "2011-11-09"}]}
