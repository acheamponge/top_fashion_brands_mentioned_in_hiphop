You're insane\"\nI've been a fiend like you can't imagine\n[?]\nI can see you snakes, and trust it's gonna hurt\nWhen they fall off [?] with no arms to catch 'em, like\nI'm Johnny Cash, man, I walk the line\nI give a fuck if you sayin' it's before my time\nAyo, a good friend said, \"When you fall, you fly\"\n(What up, 6?) And now I know what he was tryna say\n'Cause even when you think you about to find a way\nSuccess can still feel like it's miles away\nYeah, their ain't another MC in my league\nThere's only a few dudes I deem fit to beat us\nMe, [?] 360, P Easy\nAll the rest don't mean shit to me\nGet a line of that blow and immerse your brain\nAnd this'll blow your mind, call it Kurt Co\u2014caine\nThere's a feeling my heart's in love wit'\nI'm half intrigued, but half disgusted\nHalf of me's scared to be passin' judgement\n'Cause a feelin' that strong, man, it can't be trusted\nOne half always asks for substance\nThe other half fiends for that party, club shit\nI asked a fan what he wanted to hear\nHe didn't mind long as this did the last one justice\nSo here I am, with my heart on my sleeve\nMan, it's harder to breathe when you pass the summit\nYo, I first to touch down, last to touch it\nBack to where we started, but with half the budget\nI could easily've stopped by now\nAnother dream cut short, but it's hard to just quit\nIt's how I feel when the party drug hit\nKnowin' that I'm on a level that just can't be fucked with\nYo\n\n[Verse 2: 360]\nAyo\nAyo, 60's a loudmouth, yo\n(We know) Yeah, you heard me before\nYo, I'm here to make the crowd bounce, though:\nMatt Shirvington's balls\nLook up 'cause their ain't no limits\nMe and Justice'll take no prisoners\n\"60, that ain't the same flow, is it?\"\nMate, it's that dope that it makes no difference\nYeah, so save it all buddy\nLet 'em all go 'cause they can talk ugly\nBut if you wanna battle 'em takin' your money\nAnd when I nearly died it made more hungry\nUh, and I'm way beyond ya\nIf you got hope then I take it off ya\nIf God doesn't kill me he makes me stronger\nWhen he fails it takes him longer\nI am seen as a mental patient\nTry to start fires in petrol stations\nI'm here, but the rest are flakin'\nThey had shine, but, yes, they're fadin'\nNow I'm livin' in this entertainment\nIt's understood what entertain meant\nIf you don't get it then you're missin' a point\n60 turn head's like flippin' a coin\n\n[Post-Verse: 360]\nHeads or tails, babe, let's do this\n{Coin flips} Heads it is, look out"}]}
