What are you?\nWho are you in the end?\nWhat'd ya stand for? What're plans for tomorrow night?\n\nI feel like I've been lied to too many times\nTo count, so I won't count\nAnd as I gaze down upon the sky\nI see everything, see everything, see everything\n\nWho are you? What are you?\nWho are you in the end?\nWhat'd ya stand for? What're plans for tomorrow night?\n\n(And he's gonna wanna know whose going to take away all this corruption and death and pollution\nAnd all these difficult situations on earth)\n\nLook how far we have come, look at all we have done\nLook at all we have done, look how far we have come\nX2", "title": "Intro", "album": "Village Party"}], "artist": "Alex Wiley"}
