Yeah\n\n[Scarface]\nI done seen the game change and switch up a few times\nKinfolk got a ten-year plus for two dimes\nSmall baggage but we still carried weight cause rocked dope\nGot a nigga doubled up, the white boy's a nice boat\nBeen a minute since I've been in it but peeped from side lines\nMost of ya'll get it fucked up forgetting the guidelines\nWhen I came we had a code that we followed where none spoke\nAll the animosity swallowed with that we slung dope\nYoung niggas in it to win it fucking with hard now\nWent from MD to Hennessey, fuck it we stars now\nMight as well live a little, we stack it and die young\nThat's the mentality of niggas who hang where I've hung\nAnd I don't know what made it change but nowadays on my street\nMost of these niggas get indicted then turn to police\nWhere and why's take the cause, exposing your main plot\nThen they find your uncle frozen with holes and his brains out\n\n[Hook]\nScarface:\nWe don't tolerate a snitcher and this is the first frame\nWith rules for real niggas who hunger for true game\nBenzino:\n(What's really good) Still gangsta, we locked in the street game\n(What's really good) Real niggas bust shots when the beef came\nYoung Hardy:\n(What's really good) And even though most of my niggas on parole\nWe know we still get it, cock back and we let it blow\nBenzino:\n(What's really good) The streets is quiet, we just here to let 'em know\n(What's really good)\n\n[Benzino]\nYo, they say I hang around fellas with records and mean looks\nTwo-time convicted felons do records with mean hooks\nSpecialise heavy weapons, we labelled as entertainers\nI'm nice with the pen, even better with the bangers\nMy lifestyle considered to some is dangerous\nMake sure if you twisting a Dutch you blazing it\nWe stay heavy in the hood cause the streets is talking\nGetting 'fetti like we should, if there's beef, we spark it!\nIt ain't no need to quit scrapper, I'm on top of my game\nSixty thousand South Africans screaming my name\nWe international, Caribbean pirates, we warlords\nGet the buried treasure hidden up under the floorboards\nIt ain't no rest for Benzino, see I'ma stay on my grizzly\nIf I retired right now I know the game would miss me\nBut I'ma make you with my boys putting out these hits\nAnd steady trynna make noise, you make security rich\nC'mon!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Young Hardy]\nI used to stare at the wall, huh\nThinking to myself if I'm gon' make it at all\nI hustled just to get by, why\nThrowing change in my pocket and a little left to get fly\nI'm seeing time passing\nAnd with this short cake I'm stashing, ain't enough to cash in\nThere's a bigger picture\nWhen all I do is give twenty-five to a pitcher\nI'm trynna have my own land\nI don't wanna be in mom's house living a grown man\nKids in the living room shacked up\nBedroom's packed up, my rent bent, I'm backed up\nI only want the best for me, sorta made a mess for me\nI'm hoping this thing was left for me\nBut if it is, please bless shortie\nI can't see myself forty to grind the same story\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/945c7322d9672c48d11afc32d5031058.500x500x1.jpg", "year": null, "title": "What\u2019s Really Good", "album": "Arch Nemesis"}]}
