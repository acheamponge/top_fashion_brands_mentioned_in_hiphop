It\nIs comprised of four lobes: the frontal, which is concerned with speach and\nVoluntary muscle activity, the partietal, which is concerned with the\nInterpetation of sensory stimuli, the temporal, which is concerned with\nAuditory stimuli or hearing, and the occipital lobe, which is concerned with\nThe interpetation of visual stimuli.  It is the development of the cerebrum\nIn humans which distinguishes us from other living creatures.  Only whales\nAnd dolphins have comparable cerveal development\n\nVerse 2:\n\nInside my head, pretty women reign supreme\nBecause they enter my live and dominate my dreams\nI see one walking down the avenue freely\nAnd I look her up and down hoping that she don't see me\nThen I wonder, what if the girl just stopped\nThrew me on the ground and she got on top\nAnd moved and grooved until our bodies were slick\nThen I stop and say 'man, that's sick'\nBut I'm not alone in this train of thought\nAlot of people think it, but they don't get caught\nThey just live their lives and keep it all inside\nAnother secret that the brain will hide\nRight, I wonder what it's like to live life wild\nI wonder which women will have my child\nWill I be a good parent, or will I be cold\nThen I imagine I'm five years old\nI'm running down the street without a care in the world\nPuberty's later, so I don't think about girls\nMom and Dad will do whatever I say\nThey think it's really cute to see their son play\nResponsibility is like a four letter word\nThey say they told me something, I'll say I never heard\nForget growing up, I'll be a kid instead\nBecause this is what goes on inside my head\n\nChours 3: (spoken)\n\nThe cerebellum is located below the octipal lobe and behind the brain stem\nIt takes impulses from the rest of the brain and helps translate them into\nCoordinated muscle movements.  Any msucualr acticity, from brute strenght to\nA steady had, requires a high degree of cerebellur input.  The brain stem is\nLocated just above the base of the skull, and is the continuious connection\nBetween the brain and the spinal cord.  The lowest part of the brain stem or\nThe medullah oblongata actually becomes the spinal cord at the medullah's\nLowest point and is concerned with the waking and sleeping states\n\nVerse 3:\n\nInside my head, there are so many questions to answer\nAnd self-doubt grows in my mind like cancer\nBut I make sure that my thoughts are pure\nAnd my self-confidence is like a cancer cure\nSo someone tell me why I think I'm fat\nWhen none of my friends ever think like that\nAnd could it be I'm not as ugly as I feel\nBecause alot of women think I've got sex appeal\nAnd is it true, that I'm just too commercial\nNot black enough cause I'm not controversial\nIs it true what religious fanatics tell\nIf I don't go to your church then I'm going to hell\nAnd is it true, that I'm obliged to try\nTo please everyone with music I supply\nAnd is it true, that it will make me strong\nIf I sleep with a women cause she likes my song\nAnd is it true that I'm not a real black man\nIf I fall in love with somebody who needs a tan\nAnd is it true that I have to try to be\nSome type of superhero, cause I'm Young MC\nAnd is it true, that I have to watch myself\nBecause I think about sex more than anyone else\nAnd is it true, that every women is fake\n'cause she don't like me for me but for the money I make\nAnd is it true that I must be out of place\nSince pop radio likes me, I'm ignoring my race\nAnd is it true what some people will complain\nThat since I made this song I must be insane\nHell no, these are just negative thoughts\nAnd I just ignore them so I won't get caught\nI let my heart lead and my brain be led\nBecause this is what goes on inside my head\n\nChours 4: (spoken)\n\nThe limbic system or the visceral brain is located in the area above the\nBrain stem and below the cerebrum.  It is concerned with emotional tone\nHabitual tendencies, sexual behaviour and desires, and is closely associated\nWith the cerebrum.  This association provides an inhibition for the raw\nEmotional output of the limbic system.  It is the artist's opinion that the\nConcept of self-control rests upon the cerebrum's ability to regulate the\nUninhibited emotional impulses of the limbic system.
