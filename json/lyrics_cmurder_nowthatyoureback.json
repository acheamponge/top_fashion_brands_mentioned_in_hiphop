Cutt Boys, slash dirty dozen\nI know you hear me cousin, I see you pushing ?\nBut you ain't gon' last too long, them boys pushing hammers\nI just left the slammer, the beast is free\nI brought the state to they knees, ain't copped no pleas\nIt's a hundred degrees and I ? coward keep it gully, now that's my thing\nAnd when my phone ring, accept my call\nI'm writing Tru up on my cell wall, now why Soulja had to fall\nMy ? is scattered, I'm a head bussa', where they at\nAin't no home, my only home is where I lay my gat\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: C Murder]\nI live that life of a maniac, dressed in black\nThey played me once, but I ain't gon' let them take me back\nMy dog Pimp C he kept it gully, B.G. kept it gully\nWhat's up Mack Boy, and shout out to my old celly\nI used to watch ? , determined to get my stack back\nNow I'm freeing Renee, she need mack back\nCopped a Maybach, Tru Records ain't no flop\nEverything we drop is hot, like a gunshot\nA bullet to the tizz'op, of the billboard ?\nDrag for me dog but I let my pants sag\nWith the black durag, and a goon rag, shine 'em up\nThe concerts is packed, they lining up\nReal dough boys, like the C of the real dough boys\nMake that dope boys, so they coming through that door boy\nAnd ? of that gully gully, I'm rocking like Sam Scully\nThat's why them people scared of me\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: C Murder]\nThey couldn't hold me down, they tried to hold me down\nThe whole state against your boy, Murder mane'\nBut it couldn't happen, I kept it gully gully\nThat's why they scared of me"}]}
