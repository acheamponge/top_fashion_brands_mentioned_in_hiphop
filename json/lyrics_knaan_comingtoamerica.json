They really love dairy uh\nCome near here, I'm daring ya\nI shit you not, ain't afraid life gave me a rotten lemonade\nBlew up my school in the 8th grade while playing catch with a hand grenade\nYup, that's a true story. This ain't Hollywood glory\nI ain't the prince of Zamunda dog, my life is too gory\n\n[Hook]\nI'm tired of always going to burials\nI just wanna live a good life\nSo I'm coming, coming to America\nI hope we gonna have a good time\nBaby thanks for letting me marry ya\nThe green card sure looks fine\nSo I'm coming, coming to America\nI hope we gonna have a good time\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow my second home city, what can I say\nIt took my fucking heart from me\nI played the judge, pardon it from larceny\nOh yeah, that mean it never got no bars from me\nT-dot O to the motherfucking dot B\nIn the Rexdale project lobby\nPuck Puck but it ain't no hockey\nWhen the cops came, they knocked me, they got me\nI had to flee. They said to bargain, I had to plea\nSo I crossed the border while they put a warrant out for me\nWhich means they never got no bars from me\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow I know, everywhere in the world, got its problems\nEverybody got a dream of the green, it's the dollars\nBut some of us are dying in the streets, Can you figure out?\nEven in America, the hoods need a ticket out\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
