You raped this girl too, come on and just admit it\"\nI said, \"Man, I didn't rape 'er, the rhyme did it\"\nI knew this was the truth but cops thought it was a lie\nSome of y'all might even think it's just a Tale from the Crack Side\n\nA Tale from the Crack Side\nA Tale from the Crack Side\nTale from the Crack Side\n\nThe cops tried to catch me, so I ran like hell\nI needed someone to talk to, someone to tell\n'Cause all these things were happening, they were blowing my mind\nSee, I knew I didn't do this, I knew it was a rhyme\nBut who would believe me in any high state of mind\nIf they ask me who did it, and I say it was a rhyme\nThe cops didn't buy it, this is why I'm being chased\nAnd my moms told the cops that I was high on base\nI'm running, I'm sweating\nI suddenly knew that I had to get to P's house as fast as I can, so\nI shoot up this corner, run up another block\nLooked over my shoulder, and seen I lost the cops then\nI run to his door, bang like I break it in two\nHe said \"Solo, hey man, the cops are looking for you\"\nI said, \"Thanks to you, the base, and that pipe\"\n\"I wrote a rhyme high last night and the rhyme came to life\"\nHe started to laugh, he said \"Yeah, right!\"\nI said, \"It raped my girl on the block and cut my sister with a knife\"\nHe started laughing, he thought it was a joke\nHe said, \"Yo Solo, you had a little too much to smoke\"\nI grabbed him in the yoke, we started fighting on the floor\nSuddenly that's when I heard some noise that was coming from the door\nTwo conclusions enter my mind, I said\n\"Could it be the cops or the rhyme?\"\nBut before when I told 'em my man paid me no mind\nAnd when the door opened up, in came the rhyme\nWith a hammer in his hand he tried to hit me in my head\nI ducked, but the hammer hit P instead\nI started buggin' then, I said, \"This must be a nightmare\"\nHe was screaming on the floor and there was blood everywhere\nI got on the phone, called the cops\nHe went in shock\nAnd when I hung up the phone, cops was on the block\nI stuck my head out the door, said, \"Help me, the rhyme is in here\"\nBut then he dropped the hammer, again he disappeared\nThe cops kept asking me how did he get hit\nI kept trying to tell the cops \"Yo, the rhyme did it\"\nThey didn't buy it, they said \"Boy, you're bug\"\n\"You can save that rhyme story for the lawyer or the judge\"\nI get there the D.A. and judge still wouldn't listen\nThey gave me fifteen to twenty-five years in prison\nThey take me somewhere, far upstate\nFor attempted murder, assault two, and rape\nMy family won't talk to me, my friends won't see me\nMy girl now hates me, and she don't wanna marry me\nCause when this all dawned on me\nIt wasn't a rhyme it was just basehead me\nSo I tell kids and adults in this place\nThis can happen to y'all if ya smoke crack or base\nSo do yourself a favor stay away from this\nOr you'll be in jail like I was, yelling the rhyme did it\nNo one will believe you, they'll think you're telling a lie\nAnd your life will become another Tale from the Crack Side\n\nTale from the Crack Side\nTale from the Crack Side\nTale from the Crack Side\nPMD, word up\nTom J, I'm out"}], "artist": "K-Solo"}
