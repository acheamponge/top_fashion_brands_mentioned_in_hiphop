How me and money end up hangin\nI hang with Hannibal Lector (HOT SHIT!) so feel me when I bring it\nSing it loud (what?) I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud\nRun a mile - for the cause, I'm righteous above the law\nPlaya my style's raw, I'm \"Born to Mack\" like Todd Shaw\nForget the fame, and the glamour\nGive me D's wit a rubber hammer\nMy grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic\nFuck bionic it's ironic, slammin niggas like Onyx\nLunatics til the day I die\nI run more game than the Bulls and Sonics\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover (c'mon)\nStreet sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go (HOT SHIT!)\nShimmy shimmy cocoa what?
