I thought you always was the first to rise\nAyo, you heard the line, \"Everybody plays the fool\"?\nWell, I'll be that exception to the rule\nThe principal that hand-deliver lessons to the school\nI was makin' major moves, my dollar d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\nMy mission when my ambition was brandishin' a tool\nTo be a icon, wearin' slippers made of python\nGet mine quicker 'cause I'm slick as a pipeline\nTransportin' the oil, tribulation and toil\nHit the operation, but I'm back in the soil\nGot my crown tilted, my gown quilted, silk with cashmere\nBurnin' Rome down in a minute, built it last year\nNewsflash, I dodged the bullet that killed the cashier\nMy homie told me to come with him to the masjid\nThem brothers said, \"Don't go from written bars filled with rage\nTo primetime television and your gilded cage\nThen forget it's people in the world still enslaved.\"\nI barbwired my wrist and let it fill the page\nGun fire and flares, sirens glare\nI'm in a iron chair where people who care don't get the lion's share\nWhen I don't give a fuck then I ain't fair\nI'm on a higher tier with people gettin' money like the financier\nCatch the herald, I'm fresh chopped and beveled\nRap on a doctorate level, so F. Scott Fitzgerald\nMaybe I'm the new Rakim, maybe I'm fat Pharaohe\nUndergarments of armor be my intimate apparel\nPre-Kardashian Kanye, my rhymeplay immaculate\nSame cadence as D.O.C. pre-accident\nMaybe my acumen's on par with Kool G. Rap and them\nGive me the proper respect, mothafucka, we back again\nFor a couple things we lost in a fire\nThe drive, the desire to perform on a higher\nPlateau, I'm at that show lost in a mire\nWonderin' how we got so far from inspired\nLook, when photos were sepia-toned\nAnd record players were somethin' you would keep in your home\nYo, the traveler, the meaning of Tariq he was known\nFor the exemplary performance uniquely his own\nI made the twenty-one pound for some a newfound religion\nWhere money's put down, it's only one sound that make\nOGs and young lions equally proud to listen\nThe secret amalgamism of algorithm\nComin' from where only kings and crowns permitted the darkness\nWhere archaeologists found my image in parchment\nRolled into a scroll, holdin' a message for you\nIt said, \"The only thing for sure is taxes, death and trouble.\"\nThe anomaly sworn solemnly, high snobbidy\nFreakonomics and war policy, dichotomy\nThat's Heaven and Hades, Tigris and Euphrates\nHis highness, the apple of the Iris to you ladies\nAs babies we went from Similac and Enfamil\nTo the Internet and Fentanyl\nWhen all consent was still against the will\nI got that detox for y'all\nThe microphone doctor, black Deepak Chopra\nI'm a griot that make you wanna peacock your arm\nEvery heavy dignitary payin' me top regards\nBoy, I'm three optics far from your binoculars\nSo that smart money finna get the heat out the car\nYo, I'm K.Dot Lamar meets 2Pac Shakur\nGot profiled by a few cops, too hot to charge\nListen, somebody said a price tag was on a rapper's head\nSo we gon' see a nice bag when the rapper dead\nThe mask black, the flag green, black and red\nThey'll probably wave a white flag after plasma shed\nNo doubt, yo the game went they own route\nI can't explain what these lame kids is talkin' 'bout\nOr how they fit they whole foot into they own mouth\nI put a couple bodies in a brown bag, then I'm en route\nI'm sneaker shoppin' with my son, a size 8\nPrior to they release 'cause why wait?\nLook, in my estate I got electrified gates\nFor these blas\u00e9 guys hatin' at a high rate\n'Cause I dodged fate, then got great, the fly's straight\nIf we ain't family or friends then we don't vibrate\nAnd I'm that gun in y'all face, none of y'all safe\nIf I catch you at the right time in the wrong place\nSlippin', sippin' on somethin' with a strong taste\nLike Whiskey or bootleg Bourbon with a corn base\nMy Levante resemble a vehicular threat\nThe mic I spray resemblin' the sickle of death\nIt ain't strenuous to come from a continuous breath\nI set fire to the venue, I'ma spin you and step\nRinse, repeat, you checkin' for the sound of the beast\nI'm the hound, I'm a creep, I get down, I'ma eat\nI'ma keep somethin' to lay a naysayer to sleep\nPlayin' with heat, nobody and nothin' fuckin' with 'Riq\nYo, these weaklings is claimin' they cuttin' up in the street\nNigga peace, you ain't workin' with nothin' but the police\nListen, you ain't finna be nothin' but the deceased\nListen, you in interment with a permanent crease\nI strike fear in the hearts of rap figures\nWho mind bare the stigmas of time, no black privilege\nFrom boom bap niggas to trap niggas\nYou in the trap with us, when the lines is as vivid\nAs the walls on the graph, autographed by the Lord of Wrath\nI reside between the seconds on the chronograph\nHow much more CB4 can we afford?\nIt's like a Shariah Law on \"My Cherie Amour\"\nHow much hypocrisy can people possibly endure?\nBut ain't nobody workin' on a cure, my young bull\nY'all just regular, I'm an apex predator\nBrim stay fresh, feathered up, etcetera\nNevertheless, I got a message and left\nOne dead messenger, yep\nMy pen is Henry Kissinger, Buzz Bissinger\nLook, my caporegime is to no redeem\nAnd my oldest son Ahmir Saleem out of New Orleans\nTook a golf cart to the Baccarat from the Waldorf\nWhat was on the wall?
