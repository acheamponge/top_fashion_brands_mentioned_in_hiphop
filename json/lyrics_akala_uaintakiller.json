{"songs": [{"title": "U Ain\u2019t A Killer", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI never claim to be no killer, just a little skinny nigga\nBut I'm down to get in it and jack the ripper if my life's threatened\nSicker than liquor in livers, when the trigger pepper up a silly nigga\nLeave 'em stiff, no pretty picture\nI'm no atheist, but Satan's waitin'\nAnd I'm one shred of patience from havin' to face him\nReal recognize real, but these fakers\nDon't see 'til you makin' duppies like Wes Craven\nAnd the haters wanna know if you mean what you spit\nAnd they got nothin' to lose, they gon' never be shit\nBut dude don't get me confused with none of these cliques\nThat talk clips then they hit notes soon as they shift\nI'm more similar to Malcolm, I track a school yard\nBut the road is the road so a tool's never too far\nI love niggas but I'm no dummy\nAnd ain't no one inflictin' that pain on my mummy\n\n[Hook]\nWhat, you ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk\nFrom London to Leeds, get your frame outlined in chalk\nMark you for death, though we pray for a better day\nBut as far as today, y'all niggas gotta pay, what?\nYou ain't a killer, you just talkin' a song\nYou ran to the feds when it's on, pussy, take off your thong\nMark you for death, don't talk that where you from shit\nThat don't mean nuttin', unless it help you dodge a clip\n\n[Verse 2]\nNiggas talk tough but I don't believe 'em\nEmpty vessels make noise, they always screamin'\nCause a scene in the club, like the bitches to see\nLove the hype, love the noise, blud, I don't believe it\nThese dickheads from school days, walkin' with a screw face\nNow they got a ting and they caught a little food case\nAll of a sudden everybody tuggin', everybody dark\nEverybody gums runnin', 'til the guns spark\nFirms of dudes deep in the dirt like worms\nBut worms'll have you burn like an old school perm\nIt's the most dumb, with most pain, they tote guns with no brain\nThey will shoot you and tell the world just for the name\nIt's war, stay with a soldier medal\nKeep low in the trenches, or you'll need more than a dentist\nIn London, niggas'll leave you stiff and dark\nNo reason in particular, shit it's sick-ular\nGet your wig twisted, this shit ain't twisted it's the laws of physics\nIf a crisp bitch legs' open then a nigga's gonna hit it\nYou keep talkin' that shit, you go missin'\nLie too many times it'll sound convincin' but\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nBredren, fuck the hype, laugh if you wise\nCus flames that burn bright, live the shortest life\nIt's why these loose cannons don't make it to 25\nIt's time, the signs right there but niggas is blind\nSo, I stay with the London state of mind\nTouch mine, and I'm on you like shit to a fly\nClip and a guy, me nah bust shit in the sky\nThink it's lies? When you see me, you are welcome to try\nNo tuff guy, but trust I, nah bluff my\nTalk is true, you don't wanna see the proof\nBrudda yo, I'm double O with mind\nAnything I do, I move like MI5\nThat's the rhymes, even coming down to the sight\nMy eagle eyes recognize snakes, even disguised\nEverybody want a plate when you splittin' the pie\nBut you find you on your own when them shells gotta fly\nKnow why?\n\n[Hook]", "year": null, "album": "The War Mixtape", "image": "https://images.genius.com/85a1a9e929a1b07df16e80960429050f.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
