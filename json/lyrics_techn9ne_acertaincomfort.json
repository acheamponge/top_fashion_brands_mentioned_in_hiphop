Reroute dudes\nI'm chillin' in hell in hot water sittin' on my couch fools\nSo it ain't no problem walkin' through yo hell in my house shoes\n\n[Bridge + Hook: Kate Rose]\nI find a certain comfort in searchin' through the\nDarkness on my quest to find the light\nAnd as I'm digging through the ruins, that line these city streets\nA sense of hope walks with me\n\nStill I hold onto this dream of a scar-less heart and a spite-less mind\nNo longer shall I try to find a name-less ghost nor provide\nA shelter for my demons\n\n(...to hide\nShelter for my demons ...to hide\nShelter for my demons\nShelter for my demons)\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne]\nI'm good where I am in the dark, been in dark for so long\nI'm comfortable with it\nBring it, if you got it to bring"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
