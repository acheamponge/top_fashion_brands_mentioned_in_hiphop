How does he? What was he a man\nOr a machine with computerized diagrams?\"\nI tell em, \"Nope! I am of the flesh, fresh, dope\"\nI'm set apart you're just a shot in the dark\nAnd the darkness casts no shadow\nAnd I'll be victorious, no matter who I battle\nSo every rapper in the house shut the fuck up!\n\nCause if it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all\n- check one, check two\nIf it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all\n- check a one two check a one two\nIf it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all\n- a check one check two now I check you\n\nNow everyone knows I got the Milk like D, homemade quilt\nTo get your wig peelt, like it should be\nTop o' the mornin to ya, it's so many ways to do ya\nI offer you the shield, just before I deal on ya\nI recommend, that when I squeeze the puss from your skin\nYou pretend it ain't happenin\nCause everywhere is my stompin grounds\nWhen MC's stepped in I stomp em down to the lowest\nYou the slowest rapper that I met, but you owe us all a favor\nNot to, jet (nah you ain't goin nowhere)\nNot until you show us you be flippin\nI give your body lashes and whippins\nT crashes the board like Pippen, I has to be trippin\nNot for your pleasure or your entertainment I came with\nA crew called self, and everybody looked just like me\nAnd we agreed that we dope fool\nWe got flavor and everyone knows who's the saviour\nCause everyone knows, everyone knows\nEveryone knows I got flow\n\nAnd if it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all\n- a one two, a check a one two\nIf it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all\n- a check two, a mic a check two\nIf it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all\n- a one two, a check a one two\nIf it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all\n- a one two, and I'mma check you\n\nSee the mic check brings all the chaos to order\nI conquer the perimeter sealing the borders\nTo catch the feeble child weeble wobble style evil subject\nToo deadly ready to wreck, anyone in my way\nI am what is know as the expandable specimen\nNot understandable when I handle my mic check\nI enlarge to full capcacity drasticallly fast\nIt has to be my well manicured dastardly pure blast\nWill sniffle and lift, level and shift, earthplates\nSpeeded up birthrate repetitive let it live then let it die\nRight inside the eye of the negative\nI love puttin pressure on the lesser competitive\nInferior you're determined, vermin, sherman stick smoked\nI got the elephantitus styles superior stroke\nOf genius, I spoke and hell broke loose\nI saturated the streets, 'fatuated by drum beats\nMy heat, so-lar, warms the po-lar\nMelting glaciers, I are shooting star chaser\nThe laser beam on my hip swings when I rip\nFully loaded electricity clips I can't miss\nStimulating your body fluids to flow as well as I do\nI do what is necessary to counter the blockage\nI can just rocket/rock-it with no fuel, dual exhaust\nIs costing your life renewal\nI bring about a change meanin I'm about as strange as they come\nI come from the depths and wish they slept none son\nI am I was I be because I'm me\nOriginality for your fatality\nNow I am a traveler word scambler\nNot a scribbler or a scavenger, eatin the place\nYou're greedy and feedin your face, cause you're needin a taste\nOf this niceness, but my advice is don't imitate\nMy likeness, oh I'mma fella who knows what the\nMic is, and I do it somethin like this\n\nFreestyle Fellowship Aceyalone Mikah 9 Jupiter Peace\nChillin Villain Empire Afterlife Hip Hop Clan Mass Men The Nonce\nAbRude Western Hemisphere Meen Green Boomin James Born\nAllah First...\n\nAnd if if wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all\n- check one check two now I'm through with you\n\nAnd all the Heavyweight crew puttin it down, Ten Cent Eve\nDoin it at Project Bliznah-iznow, fool!", "title": "Mic Check", "album": "All Balls Don\u2019t Bounce", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0a698560532b7c3e70ca27a9e71bd6e8.948x936x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
