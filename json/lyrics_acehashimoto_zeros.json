Well, bring the whole fleet for the fee\n\n[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]\nGood morning, good evening\nGood night, nice seeing you\nGoodbye, goodbye, sayonara\nGoodbye, goodbye, see you tomorrow\nGood morning, good evening (I'll be gone)\nGood night, nice seeing you (I'll be gone)\nGoodbye, goodbye, sayonara\nGoodbye, goodbye, see you tomorrow... maybe\n\n[Outro: brandUn DeShay]\n(I'll be gone, I'll be gone)\nGoodbye, goodbye\nGoodbye, goodbye, see you tomorrow... maybe\n(I'll be gone, I'll be gone)\nGoodbye, goodbye\nGoodbye, goodbye, see you tomorrow... maybe", "year": "2010-05-25", "album": "Volume: Three!
