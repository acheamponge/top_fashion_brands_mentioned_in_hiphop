(Call unto you)\nHallelujah (Halleluja)\nDon't go let that hollow lure you\nDon't forget that solitude\nThey honor you with their presence\nThen threaten you with his prescience\nThey bought all you with their presents\nFirst they thread the needle then press in\nPrecious present day possessions\nAll answers no questions\nAll ants and no lessons\nLess it's all hands on decadence\nWhat's next to lend?\nI don't wanna kill my next of kin\nOr feel their fingers on my neck again\nWhat'd I ex for lent? Your excellence\nI'm dead come get it\n\n[Hook]\nSacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you\nSacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you\nSacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you\nNo gods, I know no gods\nSacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you\nSacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you\nSacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you\nNo gods, I know no gods", "album": "Altars"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
