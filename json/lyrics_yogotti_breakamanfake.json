HELL NAW!!\n\n(Verse 1:)\nShawty was so real back in '96\nBefore the big life all the ice and all the bricks\nWas small time grindin', high school rhymin'\nJust broke up with my bitch so it was like perfect timing\nShe wouldn't a dime piece, she wouldn't a nine piece\nBut bout a six or a seven but was real sweet\n\nBut she was gangsta in other words thugged-out\nBut she was trafficing and manufacturin' drugs out\nShe was a little older she was a little bolder\nThan all my other hoes, she drove a blue Corolla\nWe used to walk to class, I used to hold her folder\nYou know that in-between green shit to win her over\nBut fuck it, I'm a soldier, by now she should've noticed\nThat ya boy gone spit vocals or gone sell yola\nShe had nice goals future thought-out with a plan\nBut let me tell you how this bitch was trying to break a man\n\n(Chorus)\nTryin', tryin', to break a man\nI don't understand\n\n(Verse 2:)\nI told you she was real, at least I thought she was\nI fucked with her for years, but that was just because\nThe situation seemed like it was meant to be\nUntil the money came I thought we was the perfect team\nI worked a little harder, yes, i was like my father\nAll through the rain, sleet, and snow like it was no tomorrow\nI had to stack my dollars, real niggas do real things like the lifetime in\nVolume 1 of Sean Carter\nI started flippin' cars, she started flippin' out\nI tried to figure out what the fuck she bitchin' bout\nShe go a little crazy, she got a little lazy\nNo more with future plans and goals she only talkin babies\nIm only talkin maybe\nShe constantly talkin' give me\nDon't wanna hustle don't wanna work, I guess she out to get me\nMy money won't decrease by any circumstance\nI ain't gone give you shit, you ain't gone break a man\n\n(Chorus)\n\n(Verse 3:)\nNow we didn't have a pot to piss in\nShawty that's when you would listen\nMy down ass Memphis bitch, just playin yo postion\nThis before you had my son, this before I had a name\nThis before i copped the deal, this before I let it WANG\nTold you was my plan was to try to come up on some change\nDo my music out of town, i got to hoppin' on the planes\nAll the time away from home, shit you wasn't in my trust\nWhile I'm out of town Rap Hustlin', doing this shit for us\nAll of a sudden you need some space, so I let you breathe\nWent and got yo own place, and I was wrong for lettin' you leave?\nNow I'm back to fuckin' niggas hoes, back to fuckin' bitched friends\nSeen the spot I'm livin' in, got mad when I went and got the Benz\nNow you want some dividends, now you wanna go to court\nI give Nick everything he need, why you filing child support?\nLeft me, and now you hurt cause you ain't in my plans\nYou got me fucked up shawty and you tryin' to Break a man (DAMN)\n\n(Chorus til end)", "album": null, "year": "2003-05-13", "image": "https://images.genius.com/14e2f992b068d2961e29dfeeeae5121d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Yo Gotti"}
