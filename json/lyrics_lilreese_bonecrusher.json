It's the crew nigga\nThem my dogs boy don't make me let 'em loose nigga\n\n[Verse 1: Chief Keef]\nBring my dogs out the cut with the sticks\nI might just pop out the cut with ya bitch\nI'm up in the club in the cut with the shits\nRolling whole pounds and I'm pouring whole bricks\nI can't talk to you pussy boy you's a narc\nThinking shit was sharp hit yoyr ass with a dart\nHop up in this foreign hit your ass with the car\nThinking that you cold put this heat to your heart\nI got King Kong in my blunt\nI got Donkey Kong in the trunk\nI got Ceaser in my backpack\nUp this bitch and go grat-grat\n\n[Hook]\nI'm toting a big ass, bone crusher\nExcuse him, he don't know better\nNow watch him, go through yo leather\nLike click-clack we're on your schedule\nIf you knew better, you would do better\nI'm getting money now, I used to shoot niggas\nWho that in the cut?
