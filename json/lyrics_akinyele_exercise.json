Don't place your bet\nI'm not the type of guy to run up and down and break out in a sweat\nI just make the words sound hip\nI leave it up to Jane Fonda, to take care of that physical fit shit\nNothin' wrong with bein overWEIGHT, everything's STRAIGHT\nSo long as my pockets stay in SHAPE\nI never participated in gym\nI hated the thought, to even have to take a loss to begin\nThey say health brings you longevity\nBut I'm not one for that extra-curriculum activity\nYou might see the Ak, with a baseball hat\nWon't see me on no field with no baseball bat\nIn case some nigga head, got to get cracked\nOther than that, I don't plan to run track\nPicture me joggin' for miles.. HA!\nCome on kid, that's just not my style\nI just talk to girls on the horn\nYou won't see the Ak upstairs, puttin' no butter on his corns\nAnother athlete bites the dust\nAnother nigga from Egypt, make Egyptian Musk\nPicture me wearin' Pro Keds, runnin' the full court\nDon't jump out your basket-ass head\nI just cool around the block and hold down the fort\nStraight up and down nigga, I'm not a good sport\n\n[Hook]\n\"Exercise\"\n\n[Verse Two]\nDon't throw your soccer balls this way\nThe name is Akinyele, not no motherfuckin' Pele\nBaseballs is what I'm not with\nSo don't hand me no catcher's mitt, cause I ain't catchin' shit!\nThe only time I slide and run, is after a murder's done\nI get ghost before the homicide come\nBut that's a different subject; that's called games of death\nWhen your man play Russian roulette while upset\nHe can't handle it, he wants to stop it\nHe grabs the hammer and cock it, but that's a whole different topic\nI just throw my voice on plastic\nYou won't see me wrasslin' in no arena, gettin my ass kicked\nOr better yet boxin' in, some ring with gloves\nTalkin about pssh-pssh, losin oxygen\nYou know the whole blase-BLASAH, the Ak SAGA\nI'm quick, to run your shit like a JOGGER\nHuh! I don't carry no stop clock\nI knock the J off of Jock, so you can just call me Ak\nYeah, it's just that simple son\nOn my spare time, I be rackin' bitches up, at the Wimbledon\nBut I'm not one for tennis\nNor breakin' no sport records in the World Book of Guinness\nI just cool around the block and hold down the fort\nStraight up and down nigga, I'm not a good sport\n\n[Hook]\n\"Exercise\"\n\n[Verse Three]\nMe jumpin' over fences, don't make sense kid\nOn a hot day, you'll find me coolin' on the benches\nAnd you could ask me where the water's at\nBut don't come ask me to act, like no motherfuckin' quarterback\nShoulder pads and helmet, yeah right\nTalkin' that Hut One, Hut Two, Hut Three, Hike: psych\nI'm POETIC, while dealin' with the alphaBETIC\nNot ATHLETIC, that's why I don't SWEAT IT\nSo you can keep your sports on hold\nFuck soccer, the shit that I kick, yo it's bound to go gold\nI just cool around the block and hold down the fort\nI just cool around the block and hold down the fort\nI just cool around the block and hold down the fort\nStraight up and down nigga, I'm not a good sport\n\n[slow scratching, heavy breathing]\nUh-uh, I'm the fuck out\nI ain't with this shit\nFind the nigga, blow the whistle man", "year": null, "album": "Vagina Diner", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d076685831d7e5e870a3f608d4ea7916.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akinyele"}
