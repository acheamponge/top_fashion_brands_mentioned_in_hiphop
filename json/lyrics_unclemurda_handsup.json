Time to start killing these coppers\nIf Malcolm X was alive, he'll be next to me with them choppers\n(At the window) By any means necessary, let's make 'em respect us\nThese cocksuckers supposed to protect us\nKilling unarmed black men, making mothers holler\nAnd this who the government paying with our tax dollars\nAll these unjustified shootings\nThen they call us animals when we start looting\nThose kids ain't had no gun and the police knew it\nJay need to talk to Obama or let me do it\n\n[Hook: Jay Watts]\nMy hands up\n(Yeah) Gonna feel like they just don't understand us\n(They don't) Got to stay strong, hold on, keep our heads up\n(You heard) Officer please don't shoot cause my hands up\nMy hands up, my hands up\n\n[Verse 2: Maino]\nLook how they do us, they're gunning us down\nBlack males on the menu, they're hunting us down\nPut your foot inside my shoes, been running for miles\nWho can we call, we alone, who holding us down (nobody)\nMy lil' homie told me he ready to riot\nFerguson was on his mind, he ready to fire\nStaring at a cop who got death in his eyes\nHe want to kill me, I can tell, so my hands in the sky\nI'm stressing so I'm grabbing my mac 11\nTold my mamma I'm a end up on Channel 11\nLeaving in a box or they'll take me away\nPut away my Glock and I bought me a K\nBlack boys running from white cops\nWho are they to determine just if our life stops\nPlease your honor, tell me if I'm a goner\n\"I can't breath, they're choking me\", words from Eric Garner\nYou know this shit just ain't right\nMy son ask me this morning, \"Daddy, we safe, right?\" (No)\nHow the fuck I will tell him we ain't got the same rights\nThey put our babies in coffins, this shit just ain't life\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Uncle Murda (w/ Jay Watts)]\nThey don't even read us our rights (my hands up)\nThey don't got to pay for taking a life (my hands up)\nIt's like, even if they're wrong, they're right (my hands up\nMy hands up, my hands up)", "title": "Hands Up", "year": "2014-08-30", "album": null}], "artist": "Uncle Murda"}
