I'm just me, check it out\n\n[Hook: Aceyalone]\nBaby I'm your star, but you lookin for a superhero\nAnd Superman don't fly no more cause he ain't one with the people\nBaby I'm your star, but you lookin for a superhero - and he ain't there\nHe ain't nowhere to be found cause he should be fightin evil\n\n[Aceyalone]\nI want to love you, cause that's my duty\nIt's not your booty, it's not your beauty\nYou're not just a cutie you make me whole\nIt's not the movies where they fake the role\nI try to take control, for the sake of soul\nBut the only thing I get to do is scrape the bowl\nWhen God made me he said break the mold\nAnd put foot to the concrete to shake the road\nI don't have powers like a Caped Crusader\nBut I do got powers like an Ace Invader\nBack in the days he had so much flavor\nHe was so major to get you out of danger\nNow you can't find him and he's just a stranger\nAnd if you did he'd probably give you the finger\nYou hit channel zero on your channel changer\nAnd your hero with a lifesaver threw you an anchor\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Aceyalone]\nYeah baby love, and maybe love\nA joke or a fairytale, one of the above\nI really don't know what you thinkin of\nI can't make a web from underneath my glove\nI can't see through walls but I can see through you\nYou dress up the doll but that's all you do\nYou fell for him, he didn't fall for you\nI'm just me, that's all I got to offer you\nI don't save the day, I just pave the way\nIn the city of Gotham another day's a day\nI know it pays to play, but I ain't playin\nI ain't layin my coat down, know what I'm sayin?\nYou want lots of muscles and lots of green\nBut my hustle and bustle is my only thing\nIt ain't at all bad as my last song seems\nYou need a star in your life and not in your dreams\n\n[Hook] - 2X\n\n[Aceyalone]\nBreakdown\nYeah you know I could do it but\nRight now my cape is in the cleaners\nBut as soon as I get it out I'mma get at you\nYeah\nCause I can be everything you want, anything you need\nYeah baby, anything you need\nI'm it, I'm the shit\nYeah, pure, unadulterated, beyond a shadow of a doubt, perfection\nThat's me\nBut you lookin for a superhero\nAin't one with the people\nI'm perfectly flawed", "title": "Supahero", "album": "Magnificent City", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d377dd352876664b03799298f4325e48.600x600x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
