again\nHad to do it, bitch niggas in the town\nYa know what I'm sayin'\nI'ma tell 'em what I know\nKnow what I know\n\n[Brotha Lynch Hung]\nWord on the streets is don't quit ya day job\nI own spots while you won't even get to own a spot\nI'm unconcious sippin' on that sugary Saint I-des\nYour raps need that Midas touch while mines rhymes\nIt's suicide fuckin' wit me, believe it\nI'll tuck the fifty cal now cause some niggas tried to get me\nSplit me in half like a joint bitch, I had it crackin'\nSlugs went flyin' through ya window, nigga I'm the captain\nYou just rappin' to get by, might have to get to wrapped in a 6-5\nMight have to get that truckin' and get locked\nNigga you taste good like sour cream and chives over potatoes\nI'm a tornado, you just a puddle\nA poodle talkin' shit 'bout to get one put in ya noodle\nBiotch ya got the nuts to be attackin' back at me\nMy chap I'm strapped have the fifty pound metal in the back seat\nAnd it's all legal, got me dumpin' at ya Regal wid the do dirty\nGotta get mine done no matter who hurt me\nEvery bitch I got I got the key to the spot\nBetter hide yo bitch before I get the key to your spot\nStand right over ya bed wid yo Glock\nPut one right in ya head ya whole cake\nYou ain't even gon' play my shit rock up just like cocaine\nYou a no name I'm preachin' you still reachin' for fame\n\n[Tall Cann]\nSame old shit but a different day\nBack at these niggas like boomerangs\nNigga wanna come around and do my thang\nBangin' these niggas for the dead issues\nCall the paramedics to get you\nNot fuckin' wid me in this lifetime\nNot thinkin' in my right mind\nLike Mike Tyson when it's my time\nGot these niggas hollerin' woof\nBaby you ain't hard as hundred proof\nMy fellow you just a nigga that won't fit in a puddle\nPiece a shit, nut ridin' get your ass outta hidin'\nDip on 21st street ridin' there won't be a survivor\nYo ass ain't no McGuyver you done say the wrong thangs\nThe method that I got to give 'em bustin' out some teeth to say the less\nYou can save the rest for later\nI mean I'm way to major like E-major nigga\nYou claimin' my game but you ain't nothin' but a hater\nSo when I pull out my tool scram\nYa riddled drain eggs and ham you in the fryin' pan\nThe way I reach out and snap a nigga like a rubber band\nOh no there goes another man tryna fuck wid the Siccmade fam\nUh, Uh again?, God damn\n\n[CO]\nThese niggas talk alot of shit but don't really know about C-O\nThat sneaky motherfucka hit ya ass like ya P-O\nWhen ya least expect it with the cold Smith and Wesson\nHave my bitch, set you up at the telly get you undressin'\nThen it's lights camera action my pistol's blastin'\nYa night went from cashin' to missin' fractions\nBut shit do happen, so ya shoulda been ready\nInstead of doin' all that yappin' shoulda copped you somethin' heavy\nWe deadly, like rattlesnake bites y'all the taddlin' type\nDeal wit my pain and probably rattle ya life\nSo instead of worryin' about ours you need to see\nWhat's the matter wit ya life?\nWhat's the matter wit ya life boy, ya can't get it right?\nWhat's the matter wit ya life boy, ya can't get a life?\nThen spark it up this hitter does so ya can't get no ice\nSo now ya wanna hold a grudge wid, niggas like us\nBeause we move shit like drugs where y'all stayin' and cus\nAnd talk about the same shit all day\nAnd us we on the next page and after that the next page\nSo try again the next day if you can't fade us today\nPractice makes perfect lil' guy stay in ya place\n\n[Brotha Lynch]\nI'm a Southside rider, funk provider\nLeave you in the trunk tied up, punk ya lied to us\nJust to tryna Glock wid us get a piece of the pie wid us\nWe too O-G, I don't fuck wid them mics cuz\nI'm diggy down it will take plots to get me now\nAnd I got the fifty thou, wanna bet ya not get me pow\nI'm the threat starter fire starter put a hole in ya Starter\nAnd you couldn't find me cause it's time for departure\nTryna get ya CD's out, I know it start ya\nBlame it on me I got heat, I leave ya scortched up\nI'm on the porch and nuttin' up, Southside, keep locked\nWhere the G's knock niggas out for fuckin' up, we tuck 'em up\nMe and C-O and Tall Cann you can't fuck wid us\nWe somethin' rough you niggas be punkin' up we got pumps and stuff\nAll up in the trunk and stuff we be waitin' for attack\nGet me sprayin' on ya pack and now you layin' on ya back\nYou ain't payin' all ya rap taxes institute of malpractice\nI put ya raps in a casket you half plastic\nPatty mealed ass nigga put ya raps in the thrashbin\nYa clashin' wid the Burbank titan fasten ya seatbelts\nI'm bout to make ya meat melt\nThat beer breath spittin' meat chunks at ya wig punk\nI fear less rather hear less, you niggas is tryna pay less\nI make ya days less trippin' on the famous tryna get famous\nNigga please\n\n[Tall Cann]\nAin't nobody fuckin' wit me, this side of the city\nNorthside gangsta ride turn you liars to sissies\nYou ain't bangin' shit so miss me wid ya bullshit comment\nYou know me, I worship drama that was a curse from my momma\nSo if you wanna bring it here boy\nNorthgate in El camino I'm right here boy\nAll day long all night strong we be runnin' the North\nAnd I can have niggas from your hood, run on ya porch\nYa little cowards keep the gun in ya shorts\nWe keep the blunts and the ports to blaze up\nAfter ya spirit raise up you still\nThink you can rap you need to give them days up\nIt's gonna cost you ya cap takin' cheap shots at us\nSo cuz toss me the strap and put these streets on hush\nBecause they full of wack niggas and they speak too much\nAnd now we can't have that because we G too much\nSo I'ma end it on this fact nigga'll bleed too much\nYa keep talkin'", "year": "2009-08-04", "album": "Lynch By Inch:
