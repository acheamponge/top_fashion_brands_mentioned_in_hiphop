I don't feel it\nAnd if you lose me, would you fear it?\nWould you take back the silly acts that you was sharing?\nAbout how you deceived and cheated with no caring\nThe honesty in your music is fucking overbearing\nI feel you, babe, I understand where you coming from\nJust hear me out, just understand where I'm coming from\nI'm not dumb, I know what I write\nI don't wanna hurt you and I hate to fight\nI'm conscious of everything I recite\nCleanse the soul through fingertips when I write\nI don't really know if it's wrong or right\nI feel like God put me here to shed the light\n\n[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]\nBut I don't ever wanna let you go\n'Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here\nThrough the pain and the tears\nAll these years\nBut I don't ever wanna let you go\n'Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here\nThrough the pain and the tears\nAll these years\nYou ride for me\nYou lie for me\nYou would die for me\nAnd you cry for me\nBut I don't ever wanna let you go\n'Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here\nThrough the pain and the tears\nAll these years\n\n[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]\nMy open letter to my girl who got my back\nWho's affected by the real shit in my raps\nWhat's that name of the song, the Jay Z track?\nI was just fucking them girls, I was gon' get right back\nStill tryna figure my place in this world\nAin't mean to hurt the heart of my beautiful girl\nSee, I talk about the real so my niggas'll learn\nTry give 'em motivation so my niggas'll earn\nSo I talk about how I shine and fuck on dimes\nRolling in the Maybachs, seats reclined\nI know it sounds kinda harsh when I speak 'bout mine\nAnd you'll be crying in the dark and wanna leave sometime\nBut I don't ever wanna let you go\n'Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here\nThrough the pain and the tears\nAll these years\n\n[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]\nBut I don't ever wanna let you go\n'Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here\nThrough the pain and the tears\nAll these years\nBut I don't ever wanna let you go\n'Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here\nThrough the pain and the tears\nAll these years\nYou ride for me\nYou lie for me\nYou would die for me\nAnd you cry for me\nBut I don't ever wanna let you go\n'Cause when the smoke clears, you'll still be here\nThrough the pain and the tears\nAll these years\n\n[Outro: A$AP Ferg]\nYou ride for me\nYou lie for me\nYou would die for me\nAnd you cry for me", "year": "2016-04-22"}]}
