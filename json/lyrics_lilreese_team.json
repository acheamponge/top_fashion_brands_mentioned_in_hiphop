That girl fucking the team (the team)\nOh that's your girl? That bitch fucking the team (the whole team)\n\n[Verse1]\nWho got that drink, who got that drink?\nThat shit that you stir up and it turn pink\nI'm on my block and bitch I do my thing\nCatch a opp in traffic we gon' do our thing\nCatch me off in traffic bitch I got that nin, that thing\nPull up on yo' block, fucking lay the scene\nPull up on yo' block and make a big scene\n300 shit and OTF, bitch thats the team, what you mean?\nHit a nigga with the MAC, cause we don't really give a fuck\nWe out here on the grind and we'll stick yo' ass up\nYo' ass a stain boy, you ain't nothing to us\nYou might as well give it up when we running up\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse2]\nRide around with 30's, them my favorite things\nFuck that drink we out here and we ain't playing the same\nBetter make it count, don't shoot if you ain't got aim\nMy niggas on yo' ass and best believe they got aim\nWe ain't playing fair, that mean that ain't the same\nDifferent leader, different league, that's a different gang\nOTF and 300 that's what I claim\nGBE and 300 that's what I claim, you a lame\nYou get banged, where I'm from we got aim\nShoot a nigga with that thing and run up in his thing\nYou a stain, my niggas they no fucking lames\nWe don't play no games, we only aim for the brain\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Lil Reese"}
