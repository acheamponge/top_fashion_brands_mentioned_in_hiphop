Put on that Bobby Womack!\nNah girl I wanna go way back, ahh yeah check this out!\n\n[Hook]\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days\n\n[Verse 1: Ahmad]\nWhen I just a little niggerole\nI looked up to my bigger bro\nBegged if I could kick it so\nWhen he went out with girls I could go taggin' along\nNaggin' if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat\nY'all remember way back then, when it was 1985\nAll the way live, I think I was about ten\nOne of those happy little niggas singin' the blues\nThat be always tryin' to bag with the shag (and karate shoes)\nSayin' \"Yo momma black, his momma this, his momma that\"\nThen he get mad and wanna scrap\nWe stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike\nTo play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungalows\nThen switch to playin' ding dong ditch, when that gets\nOld and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket\nYou could tell the ballers 'cause they bell wearin' Gazelles\nIf they really had money raised be sportin' BK's\nAnd, all the girls had they turkish link\nIf it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it\nBut, sometimes, I still sit and reminisce\nThen, think about the years I was raised, back in the days\n\n[Hook]\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\n(and everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(and everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(and everybody say) (I remember way back when)\n(what?) (back in the day) (when?) (back in the day)\n\n[Verse 2: Ahmad]\nI'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87\n'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high\nIn 7th grade, I hated school (wish it'd blow up)\nNo doubt I couldn't wait to get out (and be a grownup)\nBut let me finish this reminiscin' and tellin'\nBout when girls was bellin' tight corduroys like for the boys\nBasket weaves, Nike Court Airs, and footsie socks\nAnd eatin' pickles, with tootsie pops\nAnd it don't stop, I'm glad 'cause when J.J. Fad hit\nSupersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts\nOr, to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses\nOf hoochies, had poison airbrushes on they asses\nDudes, had on Nike suits, and the Pumas with\nThe fat laces, 'cause it was either that or K-Swiss\nI miss those days, and so I pout like a grown jerk\nWishin' all I had to do now was finish homework\nIt's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone\nAnd I'm not, gonna sing another sad song\nBut sometimes I do sit and reminisce then\nThink about the years I was raised, back in the days\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Ahmad]\nWell, it's the niggerole, I figure that now I'm all grown up\nBecause I'm eighteen years old\nGuess you could say I'm holdin' down a steady job, crew steady mobbin'\nYou steady bobbin' your head and I'm paid, so I got it made\nBut, didn't always have clout, used to live in South Central L.A\nThat's where I stayed and figured a way out\nI gave it all I had so for what it's worth\nI went, from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first\nSo (Ahmad and The Jones' is on our way up)\nYeah, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid\nAnd we finally did, but\nSometimes I still sit and reminisce, then\nThink about the years I was raised, back in the days\n\n[Hook]", "year": "1994-03-29", "album": "Ahmad", "image": "https://images.genius.com/73f161e1c35e88e4a76d6c6b71e70d69.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ahmad"}
