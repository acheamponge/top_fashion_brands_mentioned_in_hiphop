Why you not smilin'? We in the prime of our life\nSupposed to be havin' the time of our life\nExcuse the misunderstandin', sometimes you be so demandin'\nDon't like to be told what to do, difficult but we manage\nSaid some things I didn't mean, caused emotional damage\nI love the streets, I'm a gangster, I like to be in them daily\nYour mother love me like a son but I'm not seein' me changin'\nA lot of built up frustration due to past situations\n\n[Hook]\nI ain't too hard to tell you how I feel\nWhen you tat my name on, it make me know it's real\nI ain't too hard to tell you how I feel\nWhat you say you don't do girl, you know I will\nI'm just the realest that you done met\nI'm just the realest that you done met\nI'm just the realest that you done met\nStill surprised you haven't noticed it yet\nThe realest you ever met\n\n[Verse 2]\nTurned a hooker to a housewife and people say \"how?\"\nMillion dollar vision, you just gotta stay down\nTake your pride out of the situation\nDon't get all in your feelin's they gon' throw your weight around\nAh shit\nShe gon' kill herself if I leave but she know I don't play around\nI got one text in this evenin', say she just made it in town\nWonderin' if I could see her, got some things to figure out\nI ain't mean it, I was bluffin', thinkin' please don't leave me now\nBoys II Men, I'm down on bended knees listenin' to The Weeknd\nNow friends hate me sayin' \"girl look when did he get out?\"\nMy mother left when I was young\nI'm commitment shy so when feelin's get involved I tend to run\nSometimes emotions get the best of me clearly\nAnd I ain't never tried to straddle no fences\nBeen back and forth for a minute\nAnd I know I seem reluctant\nI've been hurt and you the only one that mean somethin'\n\n[Hook]\nI ain't too hard to tell you how I feel\nWhen you tat my name on, it make me know it's real\nI ain't too hard to tell you how I feel\nWhat you say you don't do girl, you know I will\nI'm just the realest that you done met\nI'm just the realest that you done met\nI'm just the realest that you done met\nStill surprised you haven't noticed it yet\nThe realest you ever met"}], "artist": "Kevin Gates"}
