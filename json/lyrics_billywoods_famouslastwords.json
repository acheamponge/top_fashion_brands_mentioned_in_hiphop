Light the blunt\nLast moment in the spotlight, it's only right you should stunt\nGet bonded out, put up that brave front\nMom's put up the house, so you know you can't run\nCracks start to show, weeks turn to months\nLawyer says they want time, DA is a cunt\nReality won't hit till you up in them bunks\nWith cats that's gassed cause it's Hamburger Helper for lunch\nFace bashed, CO's knuckles usually chuckle last\nMention the past, all you'll get is a Woody Woodpecker laugh\n\n[Junclassic][Hook]\nExchanging mary jane and bad words\nCan't believe this lame brain even had the nerve\nMake me squeeze the flame\nAnd leave ya name upon da curb\nAnother brother slain from his famous last words\nThe say that my wrath and my actions disturbed\nMadness occurred but my past is a blur\nLaught at the aftermath of accidents and worst\nThe first shall be last\nAnd the last shall be first\nCursed\n\n[Spekt]\nOn the bubble\nThink they cooking crack in ginger ale\nThese niggas gay rocking tight jeans and fingerwaves\nThey bring a knife to a gunfight\nI bring grenades\nGet on some Dnaiel Boone shit\nAnd skin ya face\nHit ya man point blank range you catch a stray\nA little ricochet may\nHit him click 'em lick 'em\nLeave 'em leaking in the paint\nI'm getting paid for slanging blades\nY'all Kind 'n Play and only call me monster\nCause you been afraid\nGatorade can't quench this thirst\nWhen you see ya family approach the bench it hurts\n'specially when they contradict your words\nIn the church bullets burst get your limbs disperesed\nListen jerk I anin't no slave for prison work\nInject your earth but you the one there when she giving birth\nAppartheid rhymes with no Mandela with de Klerk\nI eat your face\nI eat you food\nAnd then I eat dessert\nWord!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Woods]\nI'll settle for The Post, but ideally the Times\nTell 'em I said something, make sure it rhymes\nChurchill with cigars, words to stiffen spines\nLists like Chirstmastime, you know I'm getting mines\nDue dilligence means, your box is pine\nGround is soft, it'll be fine, body's going off\nBrought a pound of quicklime, ounce of Strawberry Cough\nThat's air feshner for the Jetta\nPut a beggar on horseback, he'll ride to hell\nI ain't pay twenty bones to hear you spit accapell\nOne is for the money, two is qui pro quo\nRipped the afterparty after he skipped the show\nForce 'em to work together, hammer & sickle logo on the Polo\nIvory soap, Gold Medal Flour, desperate to blow\nEnd up left for the crows\nMississippi Goddamn\nShoot coward, you are only going to kill a man\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
