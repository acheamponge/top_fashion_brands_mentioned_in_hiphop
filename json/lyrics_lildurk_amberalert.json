Got shooters to get 'em out\nFor a feature from me, a nigga a get and gone\nMy niggas killers, my niggas killers\nI'ma amber his ass and now niggas missing\nI'm talking amber alert, amber alert\nMy shooters they shoot first I'm talking amber alert\nWhere I'm from we get em gone I'm talking amber alert\nNot a nigga missing, talking amber alert\n\n[Verse 1 - Lil Durk ]\nCan't no nigga say Durk ain't never posted up\nTwo gun cases, taking chances if the police come\nApril 26, when they in that twenty-six\nNo 52 bars, behind bars he 52 in that bitch\nI said street niggas strong like bleach nigga\nForty turn a sweet nigga, caught a case and now a weak nigga\nThe price is right, call Bob Barky off the speed nigga\nNigga close to 'em, I'ma do 'em for that fee nigga\n$1500 on my Balenciagas\nNiggas mad at you, they in that jam you ain\u2019t send em' nothing\nYou lying in yo raps boy you be fronting\nA-Amber his ass like oh\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat they sneak dissing 'bout? Got shooters to get 'em out\nFor a feature from me, a nigga a get and gone\nMy niggas killers, my niggas killers\nI'ma amber his ass and now niggas missing\nI'm talking amber alert, amber alert\nMy shooters they shoot first I'm talking amber alert\nWhere I'm from we get em gone I'm talking amber alert\nNot a nigga missing, talking amber alert\n\n[Verse 2 - Lil Durk ]\nShe just cancelled all my shows, cost my show money\nNiggas act like they got it, IG gon show money\nI spend it, can't die with it or I can't grow money\nHad millions, back in 93 ninety shows from me\nWhen I say bro in that cut I ain't just talking lyrics\nI got niggas thinking my shoes is on its period\u201d (Red bottoms)\nI side with them and got them calling saying \"I can't\"\nGot my deal got these niggas in they feelings\nPut two bricks on 'em, he dead by six something\nHow you hit that that lick and ain't get nothing?\nSo quit stunting, just quit fronting\nI'm flexing and finessing I be shitting on 'em\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat they sneak dissing 'bout? Got shooters to get 'em out\nFor a feature from me, a nigga a get and gone\nMy niggas killers, my niggas killers\nI'ma amber his ass and now niggas missing\nI'm talking amber alert, amber alert\nMy shooters they shoot first I'm talking amber alert\nWhere I'm from we get em gone I'm talking amber alert\nNot a nigga missing, talking amber alert"}], "artist": "Lil Durk"}
