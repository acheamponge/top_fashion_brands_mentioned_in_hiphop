Chicago...\nChi-town stand up\n\nIt's the John Baptiste du Sable\nExpired gentle places\nHigh style environmental traits\nSavagely scarring entire mental states\nSome of the worlds tallest skyscrapers\nAnd rehabbed abandoned buildings drug empires renovated\n\nSpit it to higher innovate\nMy name's symbolic where gang insignias is indigenous\nAnd we die for 'em the way our forefathers envisioned us\nWhere middlemen get clapped up\n'Cause two's a crowd and three-way division sucks\n\nPrecision cut, and the world tax don't help\n'Cause we adapt the workers\nWhere 15-year-old foot soldiers clap to murk fiends\nCallously squeezing\nEmpty the straps until the clips filing chapter 13\n\nStock up on long johns and bullet-proof appar-o-el\nAnd double-barrel shells. (Chicago... Chicago...)\nKinda frigid and the heat is hell's parallel\nAs modern-day pharaohs dwell\nAs gang leaders control the streets from a narrow cell\n\nHome of disparaging flows\nTo make you shit your good pair of Girbauds (you hear?)\nWe indecent propose\nWe don't marriage propose\nExamine the logic that contaminates projects\nAnd turn men inanimate objects, homie\n\nHome is where the heart is\nFuck around and make this chrome click\nAnd expect a visit from 16 slugs that's homesick\nGang dominance prerequisite\nIf you ain't affiliated, expect visits\n\n[Hook] It's the city with broad shoulders\nHome of those GDs and BDs and Vice Lord soldiers\nWhoever told y'all the cold war's over\nTell 'em bring their ass to\nChicago... Chicago... Chicago...\n[repeat]\n\nIt's the backdrop to a 6 NBA title crown\nBragging rights we're entitled now\nPlaygrounds where slain hoop idols found\nThe bridal gown Capone and the mafia married in\nWhere the patience for political figures is very thin\n\nColors is redundant\nBanging is determined by cocked caps and hand signs\nFrom Elgin to up in the Hundreds\nWhere GDs get love in abundance\nAnd El Rukns and Vice Lords was once government funded\n(Y'all don't hear me)\n\nA place where today you can win Lotto\nAnd then tomorrow\nHammers'll turn you to a milk carton print model\nCause that ferris wheel at Navy Pier\nYou think it's gravy here\n'Til the coroner's picking slugs out your baby's hair\n\n11-9 Altgeld, lawless\nThe state weight\nPerfected their hustle, gang's flawless\nTo scrape plate\nOnly short commons\nWarrants and court summons\nAnd smoked-out baby's moms you used to let snort something\n\nN****s here don't bitch up a truce\nThey'll murk you\nThen console your moms like Bishop in Juice\nWhere n****s like their pussy, pizza and their rims deep dish\nAnd some of the sickest spitters plotting on some creep ish\n\nThe rap game's sheepish\nIn the lost shepherd sense\nSo I spit it out with a mouth full of antiseptic rinse\nTryna change the scent of it\nFrom pussy to peppermints\nY'all, bow down to the wrong city to rep against\n\n[Hook] It's the city with broad shoulders\nHome of those GDs and BDs and Vice Lord soldiers\nWhoever told y'all the cold war's over\nTell 'em bring their ass to\nChicago... Chicago... Chicago...\n[repeat x 2]", "album": "Worst Fears Confirmed", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c889b12ec78f38ef02a2008434b6f21d.967x968x1.jpg"}]}
