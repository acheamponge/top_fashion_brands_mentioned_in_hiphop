Nah, we passed\nAnd smack the actual crap from your candy ass\nPeople get mad at me for repeating: \u201cDo you have any batteries?\u201d\nLike Peter Griffin, I\u2019ll leave you grabbing your knee in agony\n\n[Hook]\nSign up\nTo the battle for the Planetside\nThis is a theatre of war, not a pantomime\nThink you can hack it?\nOnly the baddest can apply\nSo back up and decide: what kind of man am I?\nA brand new kind of interplanetary samurai\nThe type to ram your mind into a brand new paradigm\nAnd if the damn reply is yes, then get down to the Planetside\nIf the damn reply is yes, then get down to the Planetside\n\n[Outro]\nChoose your side\nGet down to the Planetside\nAnd fight\nWe need you, soldier", "year": "2013-07-29"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
