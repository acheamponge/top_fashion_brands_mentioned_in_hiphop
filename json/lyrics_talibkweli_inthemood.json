Welcome to the wonderful sounds of Talib Kweli\nLadies...\n\n[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]\nI got you in the mood, for an interlude\nRaw like in the nude, I hope this ain't considered rude\nBut let's stop talkin, cause it's feelin like an interview\nI know you into me, so, let me get into you\nI'm always in the mood for laughin and lovin\nAnd rappin and fuckin', and passin' the dutch and relaxin'\nAnd puffin' and hittin' and duckin', the rippin production\nThese kittens ain't muffins, just because we stuff 'em in the oven\nMy words is drippin off the tongue like the wax from a candle wick\nIll the way I lay down the rap, they can't handle it\nCats all sappy like romantic flicks, dude, get a clue\nLike Colonel Mustard in the study with a candlestick\nThey holdin hands with these dudes like they goin steady, but\nOne glimpse and I know they're ready, you already know\nSlipped her a note like, 'you ready to go?'\nWe make a getaway plan and we head for the do'!\n\n[Hook: Talib Kweli (Kanye West)]\nI wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars\nNavigate through the truly bizarre\nWho we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life\nAnd if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight\nI wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars (uh, uh)\nNavigate through the truly bizarre (Yeezy, uh-uh)\nWho we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life\nAnd if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight (Woo!)\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nYou messin up my mo', my whole mood, told you, oh\nLose, eat crews like crews like soul food\nThe only producer that feel like \"fuck rappers!\"\nOnly backpacker with a chip like hackers\nOnly Michael Richardson, only much blacker\nSo if he say nigga, then I'ma say...\nIs this a Ritz? Carlton? Dress like, fresh, like\nJust like, I'm the shit\nUh, you ain't figured out what I'm about yet\nAlways rockin that \"this ain't out yet,\" but this ain't 'bout that\nFrom a city where niggas plug like outlets\nFar as music go, yo, it ain't no outlets, so, when I go out\nNiggas always out to get me in the studio\nAnd I ain't in the mood to flow, I'm with my girl\nAnd I'm tryin to hit the movies yo, and they tryna act stupid, oh!\nIn the club with Silicone Suzie\nWhat happened to real girls like Rudy?\nWith real titties like Tootie\nThis girl got a silicon booty!\nAnd got the nerve to act moody!\nNow I ain't tryin to judge like Judy\nBut bitch you a man, you can't fool me!\nAct like 50, throw her in a pool, G!\n\n[Hook: Talib Kweli]\nI wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars\nNavigate through the truly bizarre\nWho we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life\nAnd if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight\nI wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars\nNavigate through the truly bizarre\nWho we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life\nAnd if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight\n\n[Interlude: Talib Kweli]\nBreak it down, uh!\nWhat?\nAh-ah, uh, uh-uh, ah\nAh-ah, uh, uh-uh, ah\nYeah!\n\n[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]\nBringin the drum, keep it funky like a stink in a slum\nCause see they wanna breed cursin for the things that don't come\nThe speakers wrong that we rap dudes speakin in tongues\nChristmas time choice for what? No we keepin our guns\nSmokin a piff to cause a leak in your lungs\nYou ain't got shit to do like Friday when the weekend begun\nCompletely done with rap dudes, don't compete with the dumb\nI spill my blood for my people, see how deep it can run?\nI'm in the mood like Donte and Main Flow\nNever comin with the same flow, got it's change, yo\nIt's strange yo, to make yo chain glow, that's yo main goal\nThat's a facade like I'm somewhere over the rainbow\nReally these cats sweeter than mangoes, Mr Bojangles-ass dudes\nDancin around the club, doin the tango\nGo hard like Iverson playin with hurt ankles\nPlus, wrestle the topic from a different Kurt Angle!\n\n[Hook: Talib Kweli]\nI wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars\nNavigate through the truly bizarre\nWho we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life\nAnd if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight\nI wear the night like a cloak cause I move with the stars\nNavigate through the truly bizarre\nWho we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life\nAnd if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight\n\n[Outro: Roy Ayers]\nWow, that's a nice track!"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
