There can't be no lieing no nothin\nThere's no going around you no guys going around you everything we do now is from the up and up\nAll your guys if anybody you got doubt in your mind that you can't trust them they got to go now\nBecause it's too late later\nLater than they got to go just like you say in some of your records\n\"you take the nine out with the seven cent bullet\", that's all that's got to be done\nIf there's any doubt in your mind now, anybody even if it's close to you, they got to go now\nWe don't need anybody bringin' any heat to us\nWe got enough heat lookin at us all over us as it it already"}], "artist": "Birdman"}
