Fuck 'em\nEast Atlanta king and I mean every letter\nBut when I'm good, I'm good, when I'm bad, I'm better\nThe man of the method, it's a method to the madness\nI'm stepping in my bag with the cannon, step back\nRepping the city, showing love that I don't ever get back\nBut that's the plight of a player, plot an attack and rocking and rapping\nRippin' rappers off of the fuckin' map, suckers suffering, succotash\nI need that Mark Zucker bag, Zuckerberg\nHovercraft flows, I don't fuck with that, bullshit below\nFrom the ceiling to the floor, full schizo for the dough\nNew pistol, but I know I'm planting seeds so they can grow\nBut if they don't, then I don't know\nBut all I know a nigga\n\n[Chorus]\nJust the other day I was goddamn broke\nYou got a five, I got a five, let's smoke\nJust the other day I was running from them folks\nLike (Woah, woah) nigga you too slow\nJust the other day I was telling all my bros\n(Woah, woah) Nigga it's time to go\nJust the other day I was goddamn broke\nJust the other day I was, yeah"}], "artist": "JID"}
