I don't know you that good\nBut I never live like a scary nigga\nI step to my demons, I don't hop for them niggas\nWhen you get to know me, you learn I'm a wild boy\nEver since I was a kid, I knew my voice\nWould be heard worldwide if I told my story\nCause everybody love a good underdog story\nI was the runt nobody wanted\nLittle sick skinny puppy who the world disregarded\nI wasn't supposed to live this long\nBut god showed a little favor it is a [...?] for the lord\nAnd blessed me with the gift of pain\nAnd that pain made me who I am today\nThat's why I smoke, drink, live, think very deeply\nMy philosophy today is\nFuck the world and don't ask me for shit\nAnd anything you get you gotta work hard for it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge: Boldy James]\nYou can see the lights from the new moon, once every blue moon\nTwice every two noons, life in the grow room\nYou can see the lights from the new moon, once every blue moon\nTwice every two noons, life in the grow room\n\n(Smoke) Lala\n(Drink) Love\n(Live) Life\n(Think) Loyalty\n(Smoke) Gangtime\n(Drink) Mafia\n(Live) Whatever\n(Think) Let's get", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1c398d15552acb2f6b9a4e1bafbb83b1.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
