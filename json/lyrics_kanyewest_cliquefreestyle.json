You know, when niggas is killin' niggas\nWhat's amazin' to me\nWhat don't phase me is when niggas try to call me crazy\nCause they don't phase me\nCause I don't give a fuck what people think\nCause people don't think\nSee, I don't give a fuck what people think\nCause people just don't think\nNow picture this; now if I show up onto this motherfucker\nAnd express myself creatively\nThey always want to say, \"He's crazy, see\"\nAnd when they so distressed\nWhat would be the best thing to write?\nHow 'bout this: \"Kanye West wears a dress\"?\nYes, now maybe that can take away from the way\nI kick them niggas ass on 12/12/12\nMaybe that can take away\nNah, nah, nigga, they seen it, these niggas seen it theyself\nWell, and my grandfather ninety-seven\nHe said, \"I ain't never seen you get down like that\"\nHe ain't give a fuck about the kilt, this dress\nWhatever the fuck they call it\nYou see, niggas killin' niggas\nYou can't see through the fog\nWith all the negativity that they write on a blog\nI give a fuck about what somebody think\nIf that person doesn't think\nIt's too early in the conversation anyway\nYou know, they say, \"You should be embarrassed\nYou should be embarrassed, you a nigga\nHow the fuck you gonna show your clothin' line in Paris?\"\nYou should be embarrassed, you should be\nDidn't you read the reviews, the press?\nI don't give a fuck, I guess\nI don't give a fuck, no, it's not that I don't give a fuck\nIt's that I give most of the fuck and I'm not givin' up\nAnd it's not that I'm crazy, no, that's a lie\nI'm not crazy, I'm just not satisfied\nAnd I would die for what I believe in\nWhen I see that, uh, just a change what y'all receivin'\nDo you all receive us? Do y'all believe it? It's too much\nOkay, there's someone they can't touch\nHow 'bout some integrity from your favorite celebrity?\nThat's me, that's me, niggas killin' niggas\n\"Why he do that? Why he wear that?\nWhy he say that? Where he play it?\nOh, my God, nigga, niggas\nIt's bad enough, it's hard enough\nIt's hard enough, it's hard enough, it's hard enough\nIt's hard enough, it's hard enough\nBut you can never say I didn't give my heart enough\nAnd if we did somethin' good\nAnd we didn't say, \"Oh, excuse me. Pardon us\"\nThen they want to throw niggas back\nOn, on, on the retarded bus\nAnd when they riot in the streets\nThey gon' say, \"What, what the fuck started us?\nAnd made 'em start it up?\"\nAnd look at me like I ain't smart enough\nAnd everybody got a suggestion and a lesson\nAnd a question and a stress\nAnd then they always want to stress a man, uh\nAnd say, \"Maybe he's too aggressive\", or, uh, well\nMaybe the shit you doin' is just not impressive to a nigga\nSo let me make this clear\nIt won't be long 'til y'alls get more of what y'all gettin' right here\nNo, I ain't talkin' 'bout nobody comin' to Atlantic City\nTalkin' 'bout, \"Oh, it's just a casino show\"\nOr, \"It's just New Years, so we can't do nothin' really creative\"\nNo, I'm talkin' about a motherfucker workin' every day\nFrom four o'clock in this buildin'\nReadjustin' all these fuckin' cameras\nTo make this show better and better\nBetter every night for y'all\nAnd all they can say, \"He got a mask on. He crazy\"\nBut they just tryin' to fuckin' deter you\nFrom what you are seein' in front of you\nThis is \"Jesus Walks\", this is \"Can't Tell Me Nothing\"\nI'm not crazy, I'm just not satisfied\nSo maybe let this time open up your mind\nAnd let you know that you can do anythin' in life\nYeah, baby, you can shine\nThis right here lets you know you can do anythin' in life\nWith enough time and focus and focus and time and time\nAnd don't let nobody tell you\nCause ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique\nWhen I look around, they don't do it like my clique\nWhen I look around, they don't do it like my clique\nWhen I look around, they don't do it like my clique, so here\nSince they'll probably put this online\nLet me make this shit real clear\nMichael Jackson died from a lack of information\nFrom motherfuckers bein' around him lyin' to him\nActin' like shit okay, but I'm a find the information\nDon't believe nothin' that they say\nDon't matter who you look up to\nDon't take more than ninety percent of what the fuck they say\nCause they are not you\nAnd that extra ten percent is what makes you you\nSo you do what the fuck you want to do\nAnd if somebody tell you you can't do it\nBe like, \"Man, who the fuck are you?\"\nYou only got one life that you know about, you only got\nAnd time is somethin' you can never get back\nMost important thing\nDon't forget that time is somethin' that you never can get back\nSo don't forgot that cause the money could go\nAnd you could spend it over and over\nAnd over and over, over, over, oh\nAnd the cars could crash\nAnd now did that tell me, \"What do you have?\"\nAnd the house can burn down\nAnd whose your real friends when you turn around?\nYeah, that's your clique, clique, clique, clique, clique\nAin't nobody fresher than my motherfuckin' clique\nClique, clique, clique, clique\nAs I look around, they don't do like my clique\nClique, clique, clique, clique\nAnd all these bad ladies"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
