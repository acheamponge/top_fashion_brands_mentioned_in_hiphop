Yeah, I've tried that, but three isn't more\nBelize on her lack of commitment brought tears to my jaw\nAnd now I'm stucked with memories appolege three hardcore\nAnd the truth about multiple men bringing the pants to the floor\nSome people try fall in love in only for face flat\nSome people try to tell the truth but just can't relate facts\nMost types of liars I have alliterate when I lace wax\nA thirst for the vision of rhythm that's why I taste tracks\nI tried to stay off of the sharks swimming under my bluff\nIt's been positive so it's not to see my brother in cuffs\nI'm naming that success and I know that hustle is rough\nAnd I'm still trying like there's no such thing as struggling enough\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Barabis]\nI've tried time after time, time and again\nI've tried to bring life to the thoughts of dead men\nI've tried but all my effort seems so effortless\nI've tried talking to God, he ain't listen, I left messages\nI've tried but when the world turns starts spin like the exorcist\nI've tried now when they say my name, they say it with emphasis\nI've tried and never failed but now my soul's fried\nSo now I question whether or not I wanna be alive\nI've tried 24/7, 365\nI've tried minimum wage 9 to 5, hurt your pride\nI've tried most of life escapes it then for suicide\nNow my cold world's blooded from the night the Earth cried\nI've tried to see eye-to-eye off, follow the blind\nI've tried to give mankind the piece of mind\nI've tried to make it in life in music they inner twine now\nThis music I mind, remind your children to rewind\n\n[Hook]", "title": "I Tried", "year": null, "album": "At Least It\u2019s Better Than Pop Music", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5f803971dcf919643c9da21fd6ab2097.770x752x1.jpg"}]}
