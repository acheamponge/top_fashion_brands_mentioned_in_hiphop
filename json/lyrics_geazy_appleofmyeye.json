Lighten up, real talk I been trying\"\nAnd plus I always see you with him and she laughed again\nBut what she said next took me for a spin\n\n[Bridge: Erika Flowers]\nI saw you on stage never thought you looked my way\nWaiting for a shooting star every night of everyday\nTo wish for a chance to bite the apple of my eye\nForbidden juices had me so weak\n\n[Hook: Erika Flowers & (G-Eazy)]\nI wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you\nAnd I tell you you\u2019re the apple of my eye\n(No lie she the apple of my eye)\nIf I was not so shy I\u2019d talk to you when you walk by\nAnd I tell you you\u2019re the apple of my eye\n(No lie she the apple of my eye)\nI wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you\nAnd I tell you you\u2019re the apple of my eye\n(No lie she the apple of my eye)\nIf I was not so shy I\u2019d talk to you when you walk by\nAnd I tell you you\u2019re the apple of my eye\n(No lie she the apple of my eye)\nI wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you\nAnd I tell you you\u2019re the apple of my eye\n(No lie she the apple of my eye)\nIf I was not so shy I\u2019d talk to you when you walk by\nAnd I tell you you\u2019re the apple of my eye\n(No lie she the apple of my eye)\nI wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you\nAnd I tell you you\u2019re the apple of my eye\n(No lie she the apple of my eye)\nIf I was not so shy I\u2019d talk to you when you walk by\nAnd I tell you you\u2019re the apple of my eye\n(No lie she the apple of my eye)"}]}
