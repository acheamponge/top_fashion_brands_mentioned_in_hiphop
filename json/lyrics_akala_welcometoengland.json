{"songs": [{"title": "Welcome To England", "lyrics": "Welcome to England, part of so called Great Britain\nBut ain't a fucking thing great about the way we're living\nFor me it's hard to see how we're perceived over seas\nIt's believed we sip teas, and speak like the Queen\nNigga please, the streets will suck your blood like a leech\nA lot of shells, ya get wet but real far from a beach\nDole queue, fifty pounds a week, ends don't meet\nIf ya like me even your mum's done hustled more than weed\nTimes are harder, we get dads but few get fathers\nAnd we still pray but shit, get few answers\nEvery single area with an ethnic majority\nFull of drugs, guns and poverty, getting to thirty is a lottery\nAnd the government, deceiving the white working classes\nInto believing they're supportive to us black bastards\nBullshit! Like we're living so cool\nGo to your local fast food, take a look at who's serving you\nAnd the schools are bullshit too, so we're weighing out grams\nI'm strange amongst the mans 'cause I got some exams\nI grew among youths real nice with the knowledge\nYet I'm the only one who finished school, let alone college\nOur role models ain't doctors, but shottas who pop hollows\nChefs that cook food that'll kill you if you swallow\nSo addictive once the wicked thing holds you, you're never right\nCan't begin to count the lives I've seen consumed by the pipe\nWalking ghosts, that sold their own soul for them rocks\nAnd mandem shot them rocks, just to cop rocks\n'Cause the shining kind of rocks make sluts suck cock\nAlong with jocks and repping their ends by busting gunshots\nIt's on top, you cannot tell me all is not lost\nGrown man is busting shots just 'cause they're dying for props\nThat's why, public displays, guns spraying in raves\nBut most of these youths can't shoot, so innocents hit by the strays\nOur, future is fucked, that much is obvious\nAnd I'm, far from perfect so I make no promises\n'Cause every day create more Doreen Lawrences\nSo it's fake, when they make out like all is positive\nI gotta keep them things and be willing to bust them\nNiggas is ignorant, no discussion, you'll get murdered for nothing\nA pregnant woman, got kneecapped, over a car crash\nTen year old boy stabbed and left bleeding to death in his own flat\nMan is warring over manors not even drugs\nYou'll get plugged, for stepping on the wrong toe in clubs\nYou wanna know how real it is? I'll tell you with ease\nAll you gotta do, look at the last two New Year's Eves\nOne just passed, four teenage girls went out for a blast\nTwo never came home, machine guns that were blast\nThe year before, a man survived a shot in the chest\nBullet pierced the wall, put the gunman's own friend to his death\nAnd what's funny, is that we ain't even shocked\nThis shit happens every day, so we just shrug it off\nAnd that's a basic introduction to Britain's black community\nNo Puffys or Jiggas 'cause we got no unity\nThat's why, half the world don't even know that we're here\nYet we're living the same struggle, our mothers cry the same tears\nAnd of course, I want my kids to have a better life\nBut for now... I gotta survive", "year": null, "album": "The War Mixtape", "image": "https://images.genius.com/85a1a9e929a1b07df16e80960429050f.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
