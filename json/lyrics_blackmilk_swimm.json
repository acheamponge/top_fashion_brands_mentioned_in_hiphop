I can divide\nTo sum it up, all of this work ain't worth all of my pride\nThese heirs, they came prepared for takin' all of my pie\nI deserve more than just a piece of dough\nMy knuckles ashy, see, I needed dough\nPops, the apple ain't fall far from the tree, fo' sho\nI'm really splashin' in the deep fo' sho\nCase you needs to know, nigga\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the light's lookin' dim (Lookin' dim)\nAnd your life's on the limb (On the limb)\nIt's, uh, sink or swim (Sink or swim, my nigga)\nYeah, sink or swim (Sink or swim, my nigga)\n\n[Outro]\nSink or swim, sink or swim"}], "artist": "Black Milk"}
