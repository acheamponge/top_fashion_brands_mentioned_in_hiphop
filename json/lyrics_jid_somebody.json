Nothing\nI just finesse, I'll give 'em back all they little money\nBut everybody gotta juug somebody, huh\nEverybody gotta juug somebody, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nEverybody gotta be something\nEverybody wanna be something\nBe something, don't be nothing\nEverybody gotta be something\nEverybody gotta love somebody\nEverybody gotta fuck somebody\nLove somebody, don't fuck anybody\nEverybody gotta be something\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey asked me \"What's my sound\"? I tell 'em nothing particular\nI'm blowing this purple 'til I feel perpendicular\nMy flow crash like homicide vehicular\nLeave a nigga's brain at the scene, sign for signature\nKicking rhymes as I'm flipping through the pages of literature\nLiterally, I'm the shit, what you having for dinner?\nBorn to win but born a sinner, and that's word to Jermaine\nCold flow, Cole World, but we living the same\nI was standing in the hall, we was listening to Dame\nHe was schooling some niggas, putting them up on some game\nI'm ear hustling, hoping my niggas doing the same\nShit, that he saying, my brain strain, combust into flames\nHe dropped gems 'bout life and getting up in the game\nOr getting fucked in the game and how it's really kinda tough to complain\nWhen you can be what you want, it not really much to explain\nSo fuck that, hustle for cream and go for the dream\n\n[Chorus]\nEverybody gotta be something\nEverybody wanna be something\nBe something, don't be nothing\nEverybody gotta be something\nEverybody gotta love somebody\nEverybody gotta fuck somebody\nLove somebody, don't fuck anybody\nEverybody gotta be something\n\n[Outro]"}], "artist": "JID"}
