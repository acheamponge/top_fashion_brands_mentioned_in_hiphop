PI-YAH\nSo take your hand and fold cause this is total control\nAnd no one grabs a hold, huh\nYou got somethin' to say, before it's told\nIf you speakin' on me, you better hablo espanol\nCause I ain't tryin' to have none of the penny ante\nMumble jumble kick yak, you better get back\nClear the way when you see me comin' through\nBack up and bow, 'nuff respect due..\n\n[Verse 2]\nUhh, I come down and put my weight on it\nDrop somethin' straight on it, and sound great on it\nParties erupt, and stages corrupt\nI pour like a quart in a cup, worrrrrrrd up\nI G-E-T the J-O-B done\nMakin' the young boys say, \"Daddy, I don't want none\"\nYou puttin' the man to a boy, before I can even destroy\nI played him like a toy -- Heavens to Murgatroyd!\nCheck my Modus Operandi\nThose who know my name know I ain't about games\nI go beyond knockin' 'em out the box\nYou wanna be a comedian? Aight, where's Redd Foxx?\nSo if I want you, believe I'm gonna get you\nI wouldn't give a damn if Tony Terry was wit'chu\nSo when I come in the same place as my enemy\nThey all start runnin' like their name was Sheer Energy\nI won't say what you are but I'll hit you\nYou're found on a woman and a penis goes in you\nAnother clue, your first letters are P-U\nAct like you know boy, nuff respect due..\n\nUHH, put in rotation, better than creation, with acceleration\nMy vocabulary is very\nClever like a trick hand, sinkin' em like quicksand\nMakin the competition feel like they need a kickstand\nTo support what they thought would've brought them\nSome type of victory, but none of them could get with me\nYou better never act new\nHuh, nuff respect due..", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b6cc17d62fd6810516cc285d9804a8ab.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "1993-05-25", "title": "\u2019Nuff Respect (Remix)", "album": "Looks Like a Job For..."}]}
