I never looked at hard work as unbearable\nSo, so when I'm successful, it's no miracle\n\nI never been the type to give my demo tape to famous people\nA good or bad opinion from 'em never made me lethal\nI never chased celebrities or sweat 'em up a tree\nInstead blew the underground apart and let 'em come to me\nCause I'm the brainy type\nTaming cash, one half Damon Dash, other half Dana White\nWith a big artsy spirit, man, the world's my oyster\nJudge me for that, and not the girls I cloister\nWait! Hold up, hold up\nI can taste my Paxil, I break my capsule\nOr take five Advil\nBut every time I smoke weed it makes life fragile\nSo before you offer it, just say \"bye\" asshole\nHere, have a cock to suck and pull\nI got some goals to reach, man, rock and fucking roll\nI'm 'bout to sink they battleship\nSee, work ethic plus passionate equals success that's no accident\n\nNah! I never looked at hard work as unbearable\nSo, so, uh, when I'm successful, it's no miracle\nNo sir, I never looked at hard work as unbearable\nSo when I'm, so when I'm, so when I'm successful, it's no miracle", "year": null, "album": "Irish Goodbye", "title": "No Miracle"}], "artist": "Mac Lethal"}
