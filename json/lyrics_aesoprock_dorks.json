{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nQuestion: If I died in my apartment like a rat in a cage\nWould the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face?\nI used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain\nI'm trying to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste\nThe kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch\nSteep in a self-imposed Stockholm and Lima in flux\nMaybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks\nMade any mingling akin to being seasoned and stuffed\nIt's a theatre of jumping jellyfish, jealous little sycophants\nMiserable and flimsy from the skippies to the pissy pants\nEach one separately convinced\nThey're sketching with Da Vinci's hands\nDelusion turned the communication to prison camp\nYou fucking dorks ain't a threat to the cause\nThere ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost\nI think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts\nStep out the tempest, a measure of what the spectrum involves\n\nMaybe no one cares, party over here, I'll be over there\n\n[Sample: Sweet Tee - On The Smooth]\nDon't need no help, all by myself\n\n[Verse 2]\nI used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene\nIt meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe\nMaybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive\nI know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe\nI think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong\nThe songs are echolocation up in impregnable fog\nThat's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws\nAscend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs\nIn a mess of obnoxious fantasy, posturing and pageantry\nI ain't even mad, I'm impressed, shit it's baffling\nGod almighty, chop an ivory tower to piano keys\nPlay your own dirge on the way to surfing maggot beach\nYou fuckin' dorks ain't a source of the art\nYou can't be cooler than the corners\nWhere you source all your parts\nThe poker-faced, all it takes a couple sordid remarks\nWe let the manticore out, We make the sorcery bark\n\nLife is so unfair, party over here, I'll be over there\n\n[Sample: Sweet Tee - On The Smooth]\nDon't need no help, all by myself\n\n[Verse 3]\nI view the rattling of sabers like a show to expose\nInsecurities exploding in emotional code\nWhen braggadocio to go from mostly jokey to gross\nCorrode a homie 'til his probity is notably ghost\nBefore the hobby was a job, he was a miniature hell\nYou would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle\nThe disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill\nBut you as anything menacing is a difficult sell\nIn a whistle and bell-o-rama\nBlack mollies that dress up like piranha\nIt's not even compelling melodrama\nIt's a comedy, somebody wanna shop you as a saga\nI'm very voluntarily persona non grata\nYou fuckin' dorks ain't the leaders we need\nThis ain't the medium for divas out to weasel and breed\nI'm offin' coffee with the paupers over tea with the queen\nDon't make him show the regency what disobedient means\n\nHeavy load to bear, party over here, I'll be over there\n\n[Sample: Sweet Tee - On The Smooth]\nDon't need no help, all by myself", "title": "Dorks", "album": "The Impossible Kid", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1d8582e283f0f4d717c0ba1fe12df744.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2016-04-29"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
