I'm young living wild\nI'm young living wild\nI'm young living wild\nKnew I could do it ever since I was a child\nSo I put in work and it all worked out\nLook at me now, I'm young living wild\nI'm young living wild\nI'm young living wild\n\n[Verse 1:Bishop Nehru]\nFeeling euphoric\nI hear the beat,my lyrics forking\nUntil it forfeit or eargasms have em stuck in orbit\nThey try to gas em I tell em keep it in store and\nThey mad and living boring\nI'm soaring trying to get more lit\nI was distorted, but now the mission's aborted\nUsed to retort, but now I just wait to record it\nAnd to ignore it, but it really ain't important\nAnd now I'm porting more fortunes so fam could be affording it\nYou [?] in the store that's the reason I don't sleep anymore\nUsed to be the creep peep seen as immature\nNow they see he's so much more\nTruly me and I'm me to the core\nThe flees get ignored when you leading the score\nSeems that they bored seeking rewards\nI'm just trying to be receiving awards\nLeaving their jaw the on the floor\nThey in awe\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf they gon' hate\nThen I might as well make sense I don't even rap\nI just vent and invent\nWit was pent inside\nPut the pride to the side\nCause we all got problems that we all think align with\nNeeded a plan so I started to devise it\nTook time now her son's on the rise like her eyes is\nAlways working like phones in Verizon\nThe biddies want growth so these guys is despising\nCouldn't cope the sky's lit and lit the lighting then\nI lightened up as I got enlightened\nOthers pretend basing knowledge on likings\nThat's the lies type that I tell go hiking\nLike send us the QBs before spiking\nWatch who you idolize and move like a viking\nI been living my life just trying and climbing\nThey finally finding this diamond is flying\n\n[Hook] x2"}], "artist": "Bishop Nehru"}
