Son of an immigrant, passionate, intimate\nI was so infatuated with rap and gettin into it\nFor me it was imminent, felt so fuckin genuine\nI would rap for anyone worth a new millenium\nThen I told my dad my plan, back then\nHe was rockin to \"Roxanne, Roxanne\"\nNow I'm all grown up educated and my plan is succeedin\nAnd I'm eatin like a deacon in the Garden of Eden\nAnd the, sooner I blow, the sooner we bust\nBreathin life into those parties that would usually suck\nBreathin life into those records that would usually flop\nWith rhymin, timin shinin like a jewelry shop with Titan\nGiant fightin off two or three cops writin\nInvitin kids to watch you and me box brother\nThe older I get, the harder I spit\nI'll beat that ass like your father and shit, oh no chico!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Pacewon]\nTake it to the bridge now\n{?} hair pull, pass me a scalpel\nPourin 'til bass flow, all in your asshole\nDirties rascal, start a fiasco\nWay out in Glasgow, don't make me snap yo\nBringin it back bro, never get tackled\nNever a flag thrown, I'm in a bad zone\nYeah I'm on your one yard line, ready to rush in\nI can feel my heart beatin, I'm bustin, it's percussion\nLike Nick Cannon played it in \"Drumline\"\nAnd I can freestyle while I'm bustin at one-time\nAnd I can freestyle at the table at lunchtime\nThat's why everybody with a radio bump mine\nThat's why everybody with a radio like this\nNot just for backpackers or the crazier white kids\nNot just the hoochies or the niggas that clock\nThe killers too they wanna see the nigga Won really rock\n\n[Hook]", "year": null}]}
