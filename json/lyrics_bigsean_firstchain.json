Kanye think I'm dope\nSee this piece that I own now, how sick is the rope?\nTaking life for what it is, the troublesome chick\nWho throws fists; sometimes it's the weather\nThings switch up, people trip up\nThe money come down, then climb up, but when it come again\nThe most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'\nSaying that you love me, I surely hope and if you don't\nMotherfuck that sometimes, so dead it\nShred it; young nigga lost to the night\nI'm so ready to let it go, my life is fucking awesome\nI could be fuckin' dead right now, but I'm awesome\nSo fuck whoever has a bad thought don't know the god\n'Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the God\nIt might be too late, but the songs will live on\nJust know this fact, you were all wrong\nNow watch me do my silly dance, not really a dance\nMore like a prance, I'm signing off with a crotch grab\n\n[Outro: Kid Cudi]\nThank you, man, for letting me get on this record, Sean\nYou the coolest\nGOOD Music nigga, forever\nUnderstand?
