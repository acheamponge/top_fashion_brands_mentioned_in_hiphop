It was dummy luck\nNeed a new Lam', no sedan, fuck a Hummer truck\nI'm aiming for the top, I'm steady climbing, fuck a runner-up\n\n[Chorus]\nI was broke as fuck, down up on my ass, had the lowest luck\nUsed to ride the bike up to the store, I need a Rover truck\nA Bentley coupe, yeah, I'm wearin' Prada, I like Fendi too\nGrandma passed, had a heart attack, only 62\nMy cousin shot, got me paranoid, who to trust or not\nGave my brother 25 years, that really sucked a lot\nPost-traumatic stress is building up, you niggas so dramatic\nFuck these other niggas, I'm the illest, I'm the coldest at it, ayy\n\n[Interlude]\nUh-huh\n(Hey)\nYeah\nWoo\nUh, yeah, uh\n\n[Verse 2]\nMom and dad never had a damn thing, damn shame\nNow I'm poppin' champagne on a private jet, fuck an airplane\nOrder Bossa Nova, eating plantains\nPresidential Rollie, fuck a campaign\nImpeach, nigga, ten deep, nigga\nRemember days we was wearin' J's\nAnd a gold chain, only had three figures\nSo fortunate, proportionate\nLost Boy, nigga, no coordinates\nRemember Christmas? We was giftless\nThree foot tree, no ornaments\nPull my dick out, hoes swarmin' it\nFlow cold, nigga, no warmin' it\nMama couldn't afford AAU\nSo we couldn't hoop, nigga, no tournaments\nI remember days sippin' lemonade\nIce cream truck gettin' plenty paid\nCandy lady had Jolly Ranchers\nI don't really have a lot of answers\nI'm just searching for the same shit\nSame niggas that I came with\nPremonitions over reminiscing\nLam' truck how I lane switch (Ah)", "title": "Broke As Fuck"}]}
