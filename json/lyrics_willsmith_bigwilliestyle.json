Omar\nCarry money bags collect the chips then we all quick to swift exit\n\n[Hook: Will Smith]\nNow how we do it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style baby)\nHow we doing it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style)\n\nNow how we do it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style baby)\nHow we doing it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style)\n\n[Verse 3: Left Eye]\nIt's Left Eye with a tight crew\nRepresenting like it's ladies night\nComing right through\nDon't be spiteful\nPlus an eyeful, Sporting hot pink\nRocks in the link, In the drop with a mink\nLike my- don't stink\nGot you in the palm with a bomb like Saddam\nBlowing up spots then running off with the pot\nLeft Eye ready for action\nThe main attraction\nI'm in the fast lane passing\nBreaking you down like fractions\nWhile we be rapping about things that really happen\nBig willie style Philly style let's make it platinum\nWith Mademoiselle from Gezals to Versace\nWith a sweet smell\nThis female leading the posse\nGot jokes like Cosby\nIn the lots where the cars be\nWith no apologies it's Left Eye\nBig Will, let the champagne spill\nIs it a man's thing for real?\nCan us girls roll wit y'all\nWhat the deal?\n\n[Hook: Will Smith]\nNow how we do it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style baby)\nHow we doing it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style)\n\nNow how we do it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style baby)\nHow we doing it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style)\n\n[Verse 4: Will Smith]\nWell now it's looking like a car show\nConvoys and whips on the strip\nPulling up in the six making brothers sick\nFor real\nBig Will household name, Entertainer\nGold handle cane and matching gators\nSwerving lane\nIn pole position rolling deep like a coalition\nIn soul position and can rock a whole convention\nMovie screens to the club scene\nMy whole crew looking clean\nShine with a diamond gleam\nStep above where the players be\nDon't hate me\nOne is where they rate me\nLately you could find me\nBehind the door marked V.I.P\nEating grapes under the A.C\nBig willie style is how we do it\n\n[Hook: Will Smith]\nNow how we do it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style baby)\nHow we doing it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style)\n\nNow how we do it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style baby)\nHow we doing it?\n(You know it's Big Willie style)\n\n[Outro]\nThis one goes out to all the big willies", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9691e23145a1921b473ccb40f139b416.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Big Willie Style", "title": "Big Willie Style"}]}
