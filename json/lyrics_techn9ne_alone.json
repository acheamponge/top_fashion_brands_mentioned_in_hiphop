Exclusive (Chea), and I know that I might fall\n\u2018Cause life is stupid, \u2018cause cupid shoots it and I fight off\nWhat it might produce, its love, whatever has it I run\nPeople, pets and even movies that have it, I shun\nThinkin' back when I had a family, was glad I was some\nI picture myself in the future, old mad, sad \u2018cause I\u2019m one\n\n[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]\nOh, ain\u2019t no phones ringin'\nAin\u2019t no one speakin' when you\u2019re alone\nOh, feels like there's no reason\nFor me to keep breathin' if I\u2019m gonna be alone\nI can\u2019t sleep alone\nAnd I can\u2019t go eat alone\nYeah, the crowd gon' shout\nBut when the lights go out you know, you know, you know\nYou know, you know, you know, you know\nYou know, you know, you know, you know\nYou know me being me\nYou wouldn\u2019t think I\u2019d be\nYe\u2014ye\u2014ye\u2014ye, alone\n\n[Outro]\nStrange Music"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
