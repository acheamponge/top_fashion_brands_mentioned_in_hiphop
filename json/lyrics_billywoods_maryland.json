Just to get money \u2018cause niggas didn\u2019t want a real job and shit.  Soon as they gave us the money, we\u2019d just go sit on our lawnmowers, get some weed out and just smoke that shit, play ball all day, man.  That was back in the day, man.  Shit.  And one time, my lawnmower just broke, we just left it in the woods and shit?  Damn\n\n[Verse 1: billy woods]\nThanksgiving Day, Barry Sanders on the breakaway\nEarly on, I went to his house, he came\nTo mine, so we ate twice.  Cornbread\nTurkey, wings, peas, and rice.  We went in the shed\nThat night with four bottles of 800 Ice\nI\u2019m telling you: by midnight, we was crazy nice\nSharing the jack, my man gave me some advice\nLike, \u201cEverything comes with a price\nAnd change the only guarantee in life.  One day\nWe might not be so tight.\u201d  I was like, \u201cCome on\nDude, always be me and you,\u201d but, inside\nI knew in some ways it was true.  He said\n\u201cBe careful what you do \u2018cause that\u2019s what you are\nAnd every day you open your eyes is the one to be thankful for\n\u2018Cause everybody gets a lifetime, nothing\nLess, nothing more, so before you step\nBe sure and know there\u2019s always a time for war\nBut you can never really even the score\nOr see what\u2019s behind that door\nWhen I\u2019m gone, just pour a little on the floor\u201d\n\n[Bridge: billy woods]\nMaryland, you\u2019re my life\n\n[Outro: billy woods]\nYo, nigga always keeping wood for you, nigga, always, \u2018til we going to meet the man!  Yo, you remember that time I was running, we was both running from the cops and shit and hopped that fence and I lost my backpack down in that grass and shit, and I was scared to go back and shit \u2018cause it had mad weed in it, and you just went back, I was just waiting for you on the porch and shit like, \u201cYo, this nigga probably got arrested.\u201d  You came back with the bag, and we just smoked the biggest fucking Philly you ever seen, nigga"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
