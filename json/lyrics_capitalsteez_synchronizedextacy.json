(Like dat)\nShow me that you got it like that (Like dat)\nDo you really have it like that? (Like dat)\nKiss that, and that, give it like that (Like dat)\nDo you really have it like that? (Like dat)\nShow me that you got it like that (Like dat)\nDo you really have it like that? (Like dat)\nKiss that, and that, give it like that (Like dat)\n\n[Verse 2: A La $sole]\nBiting your lips as we visit those positions\nExperience of this feeling it was so serious\nBaby was driven into winning so her panties disappeared from this magician\nAnd then I hit it with no intention\nBut this tension got me pretending this love don't imprison\nHer prism asserted my decision\nShe was so with it, I was so witty\nShe scratching on my back while I'm swanking on her titties\nTurn off the TV and made our own movie scene\nTurn off the phone so no hoes would intervene\nAs in between your jeans, your thighs, your seams\nIt seems she wanted more of me\nDamn right, a nigga like me gave it to her\nShe through it back and I relaxed as I gave it to her\nCause I ain't never been a quick pumper\nThis is real love, no fake baby, never no Brian Pumper\nBut as I love you, I know you hear the thunder\nMake you rain, bed so wet, using my umbrella\nCalled in sick then said that you was under the weather\nBut you was getting wetter as the ride was getting better and better\nKissing so clever, you know what's next up\nLay on your back or whatever\nPain is pleasure as I caress ya\nBanging on your dresser\nTurn off the lights and let A La undress ya"}]}
