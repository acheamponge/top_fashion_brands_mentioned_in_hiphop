Or maybe not\nMaybe we can decipher what made the plot\nPeople forever tryin' to take your spot\nIf you don't let them, then you're safer\nWhat I wanna do is bring the musical raps\nSo you know you'll enjoy when you're choosin' a track\nIn this life, yo, I try to be the odd one out\n'Cause you know all the rest you forgot about, let's be honest now\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat you're seeing is what you get now\nI'll stand my ground and I won\u2019t be left out\nI still believe in myself to get proud\nI\u2019ll never let myself fall or step down\nWhat you're seeing is what you get now\nI'll stand my ground and I won\u2019t be left out\nAnd I'm never stoppin' until I just make you see\nWhat you see is what you get now\n\n[Verse 3]\nUh, I won't apologise, I dress to impress\n'Cause deep down, I'm an approachable, respectable head\nYou should never forget that I plan to be sincere\n'Cause I wanna make the music that my family can hear (ye-yeah)\nWhile turnin' the page, I'm learnin' that hate\nIs workin' a stage and cursin' 'til you're certain to break\nAnd I'll sing my favourite song to people who don't know\nI'm gettin' hated on for smiling in photos\nAnd, whether rockin' thongs or wearing kicks\nI'd rather look porno than dress a bit like a derelict\nBecause I don't want chicks thinking I'm hardcore\nI'd rather have 'em see my face in their heart's core\nYou want more? You want me to keep going?\nWhile rocking the beats, knowing that honest MCs know him\nIt's not a disease, no, I'm just on top of my feet\nI'm getting dissed but coppin' it sweet, hopin' for more\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat you're seeing is what you get now\nI'll stand my ground and I won\u2019t be left out\nI still believe in myself to get proud\nI\u2019ll never let myself fall or step down\nWhat you're seeing is what you get now\nI'll stand my ground and I won\u2019t be left out\nAnd I'm never stoppin' until I just make you see\nWhat you see is what you get now"}]}
