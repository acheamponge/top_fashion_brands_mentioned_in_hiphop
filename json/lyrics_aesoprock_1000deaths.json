{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse One]\nI saw the wrought-iron cross inverted circlin' above my turret\nSlid the spiraling banister down and hide, banished am I\nMy ruby glass glazed specs staple the trader of market thieves\nWhere vendors count the stolen citrus out their pyramids\nMirrored without a slapstick\nMavericks plugged directly to third rail surges\nPiss on electric mayhem through city commuter circuits\nOooh child, raised as oddity, son of a circus side-show freak\nPertinent to the slide show, the wino's leak but I won't speak\nInfected projection hung thick in the air\nPungent as burning plastics upon whiffing the nasal cringes\nPucker another 60-second lapse while 60 stars collapse the suckers\nAnd I'm reborn every time the wine metamorphs back to water, my god\nSweet Christ, crucify me with railroad spikes\nUse my skull to bash them all in, gather sit and grin, weave\nAll fail the most serene communication pageant\nWhere sitting with a stranger and living awards the badges\nI spell merit with my name stitched on my heritage\nAnd serenade arrogant simpletons to feed my cherished grin\nBuried in leagues a \"'Please', Thank You', 'Pardon', 'Excuse Me'\n'Your Welcome', 'May I?' ohh, I'd like to nod but no you may not\nLet's take a deep breath, naw let's take a breath\nNaw let's take, naw let's aaah shit, well I guess that about says it\nMaybe I'll craft the sycamore canoe and paddle upstream\nWhere the luck seems to reflect precious lovely interventions\n\n[Hook]\nI have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for you and yours\nFor kicking your fantasies overboard\nI mean I'm only one servant, making one hell of a diversion\nAnd if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed\n\nI have died a thousand deaths, and I apologize for them and theirs\nFor breaking down their ropes, ladders and stairs\nI mean I\u00b4m only one servant, making one hell of a diversion\nAnd if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed\n\n[Verse Two]\nYou ever died a thousand deaths?, I have\nAnd in the morrow stood a thousand steps from where my nourish laughed\nAnd made a boat at, nomad, I roam in a social coma\nJonesing for home alone days to sit and count my poems, I\nDig in the dirt I rig up the earth like pulley systems\nThereby painting the perfect metaphor for hung juries\nStrung along a song of spawning thorns of fury\nNumb the anti-add-alarm before he recognized this worries me\nCarpet-bombers spearheading fink operetta\nWalk my line, now what? Now strut that little poison combine\nY'all call natural, in honesty promise me twenty thousand Sloppy leagues\nAnd dive and finding my thriving ivy leaves climbing up the pit fall\nLack of most lords aboard, heroes unsung heroes unbrung rewards\nYo if I flutter in a trouble clutch then I dance fancy forward\nLike park children double dutching ropes in burning city summers\nMy wing span can and will employ full expansion\nUnfolding while lamping at home with my hands panning for gold\nTold them the roof was on fire, when that structure burned to ashes\nAll y'all saw was Aesop Rock holding an empty book of matches\nMaybe I'll sit until the spilling motors clear\nMaybe I'll sit and stroke my billie goat beard\nAnd rethink the time angels appear, maybe I won't\nBundled in my humble little plummet\nNumb enough to die those thousand deaths under the sun it makes me sick\n\n[Hook x2]", "title": "1,000 Deaths", "album": "Appleseed", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f515b4ae044f84fd9925d86f6dca5cfa.200x200x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
