What's your name?\"\nI said \"It's Andre, uh! I can't complain\"\nI love singers and ghetto basketball players\nAnd I spit rap for all the legendary crack slingers\nWe kick it live, buzzing like a bee hive\nAnd it'll remain that way until we hit the sky\nLike Public Enemy #1\nCats come to my show and say they uzi weigh a ton son\nYou know the chemistry, do you remember me?\nMan, I'm your tiger from way back in '83\nWe ate ice cream and played hoops man\nWe did all these things before the D game\n\n[Hook]\n\nBye-bye"}]}
