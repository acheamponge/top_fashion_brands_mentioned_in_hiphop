I've offended every last pedestrian\nUpon my way over to bless that bar seat\nThere's no excuse, I know, I'm sorry, but I'm here\n[Slug] Which is more than I can say for my love of these puppeteers\n[Aesop Rock] Well they tug 'em all in perfect syncopation, make they mommas proud\nCertified absurd prince of flattery\nProduct of a drunken, rhythm-driven faculty\nCheck a mortal mayhem discotheque, boogie with a bounced check and a cigarette\n\n[Verse 2: Eyedea]\nI prick my finger on a thorn bush, picking you a lilac\nYou can water it with your envy and burn it with your livestock\u2019s\nI guess you can come on my trip, why not?\nTie knots in our existence and marry-go-round your holy tripod\nFor every single flame the imploding sky drops\nI cross the burned bridge of syringes ? by lyrics ? cyclops infinitely focused on moving this ice block\nI could of land a nice job, but I plan to fight God\nUnderstand I might stop at nothing, short of order distorted by torched porcelain images of man\nMy glands are quite dormant coordinated with porous\nWon't forfeit my stance and transmission if I hit the right knob\nFright clot, numbs the thumb, run and stir the rice pot\nThe anger that hovered kept me in a tight lock\nI'm parallel with every line Jesus Christ thought\nLeaving heaven frozen, rolling a seven on this dice shot\n\n[Verse 3: Slug]\nSlow down, float showdown at the show\nMinnesota to Manhattan until it gets broken loose\nHolding you immobile to show you what we're going through\nAnd ain't nothing changed and the rent's still overdue\nStill hate the rappers that speak through the mean mugs\nAin't got no bite but you bark like a tree trunk\nThat shit doesn't flush\n[Aesop Rock] And every pipe is plugged\n[Slug] I know you're loving us (you ride the nuts like the dick was a bus)\nNow hold tight, your whole energy doesn't flow right\nIt's enough to make me wonder if you prefer to just blowpipe\nWe're this close to giving you hoes a good choke\nClowns thinking they're profound man, they're not even a footnote\nI walk around the world like a malnourished tourist\nA refugee, caught between the referee and the purist\nCircuits overloading, cyborgs about to explode\nRelease the little man inside my tired soul\nSomebody must have let the lion out the cage\nAnd got him high before he climbed up on the stage\nCause here I am again, glossy-eyed, topsy-turvy\nAnd this is just another pitstop on the journey\nMost of ya'll don't even inspire me to diss you\nSo caught up in the politics, forgot to kick the issues\nSlug, call me Se7en, ya'll know what I'm about\nNow close your fucking mouth, before my balls fall out\n\n[Outro: Slug]\nShut your mouth\nShut the fuck up\nShut your mouth\nShit talking bitch\nSick of ya\u2019ll talking shit [shut the fuck up]\nYou don\u2019t know me, you don\u2019t know us\nHalf ya\u2019ll fucks don\u2019t even rhyme [little bitch]\nWho you talking shit about man?\nGo play a video game you little bitch\nShut your trap [yo you a critic?]\nYo come to Minnesota and get smacked [get smacked]\nCome to the island and get smacked [get smacked]\nI don\u2019t care, I see you in Oakland and I\u2019ll smack you\nShut your trap, little internet bitch\nI\u2019ll smack you in Tulsa\nI\u2019ll smack you in Buffalo\nI\u2019ll smack you in Milwaukee\nI\u2019ll smack you in Madison\nI\u2019ll smack you in St. Louis\nI\u2019ll smack you in Austin and in Dallas\nI\u2019ll smack you in Salt Lake City\nBeeyotch", "title": "Thorns", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/4004dce7b01c5776f297be37022d0666.600x401x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
