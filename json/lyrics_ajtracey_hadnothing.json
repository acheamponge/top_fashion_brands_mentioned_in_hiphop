Cuh the pussy fat\nAnd Courvoisier, Courvoisier, it's hella brandy\nShe don't drink with me but she's winging off the mandy\nAnd when I'm finished at her crib, I hit the Lane again\nDotted up another ting, haffi make it rain again\nWe never had the damn pounds, now we're making 'em\nCuh I don't wanna let my mother feel the pain again\n\n[Hook]\nLook, I remember when I had nothing\nCalled my plug, copped a blower, then I grabbed something\nThe feeling when I got to see a bag something\nMemories of when I grew up, never had nothing\nSaid I remember when I had nothing\nCalled my plug, copped a blower, then I grabbed something\nThe feeling when I got to see a bag something\nMemories of when I grew up, never had nothing\n\n[Verse 2]\nRe-up's on the block, I put my team on it\nClutch backs, no scope, no beam on it\nCouple pussies wanted beef, I said \"I'm here, G\"\nAll talk, now I've never seen that man near me\nFearless, walking through the hood with a lion heart\nMy niggas trappers and their food'll tear your line apart\nI'm the real deal, niggas just a counterpart\nSo's I make counterfeiting sweeter than a Lion bar\nBruddas saying that I'm pissed, I've gotta battle on 'em\nI'll get the something off my uncle, start a rattle on 'em\nFuck a little baby beef, slap a cattle on 'em\nTurn Pepe out the cabby, put a tackle on 'em\nI ain't a rapper on my strip, I'm feeling Money Mitch\nI like the champs, I like the trueys with the gully stitch\nAnd I ain't messing with the yatty from the other bitch\nStraight corn flying through a thotty, that's a funny bitch\nAmo showed me all the secrets how to bag quicker\nTaking minutes off the hours so I trap quicker\nTrini boy, you know it's crazy how I back liquor\nAnd don't listen to that pussy, I'mma slap a nigga\nThey say they're on to me, never seen 'em hitting me\nIf they've been creeping on my lane, they've been missing me\nI'm on my money ting, tryna be the bigger G\nRappers telling stories but I rate your creativity\n\n[Hook]\nLook, I remember when I had nothing\nCalled my plug, copped a blower, then I grabbed something\nThe feeling when I got to see a bag something\nMemories of when I grew up, never had nothing\nSaid I remember when I had nothing\nCalled my plug, copped a blower, then I grabbed something\nThe feeling when I got to see a bag something\nMemories of when I grew up, never had nothing", "year": "2015-12-09", "album": "Left Back", "image": "https://images.genius.com/57a07e1d1e21143f9e727f0b43a19c91.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "AJ Tracey"}
