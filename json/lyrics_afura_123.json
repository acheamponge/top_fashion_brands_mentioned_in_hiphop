Nah, cause she don't want the drama\nI'm proud to lay in bed with her, under my armor\nIf you are Nefertiti, I am an dentured farmer\nSelf realization, to endure that time\nAnd allow us, and enjoy the blast\nI see the queen, with the gleam, like no other queen\nI write it, then spit it, so you know what I mean\n\n[Chorus 2X]\n\n[Afu-Ra]\nWhen you pop the vagina, water in my eyes\nYour squirms, your wiggles, water in my eyes\nEvery turn, every, to ta-ta-ta, tustle\nMovin' couples of muscles, tryin' to hurt something\nBut the only thing seeked, is life\nA site for sore eyes, despite the demise\nI was and all, I helped them what bringin' it forth\nHere, two-four, I saw a vision, and said the gate was open\nBut the mix so didn't through, to got to wheel it open\nStraight click the umbilical, without a syllable\nTrained by what, yo, man in the middle\nAs it dump off, I let it, let it, let it bump off\nNow let me tell you about something, burst then jump off\n\n[Chorus 4X]", "title": "1, 2, 3", "album": "Life Force Radio", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2ab295588bcecbcbb2710f3930d44f59.945x945x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Afu-Ra"}
