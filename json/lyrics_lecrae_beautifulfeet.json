Nobody dared\nBut los got up out the coma got and was able to hear\nA missionary shared the gospel to his open ears\nHe got saved got trained got discipled\nBack to hood you could find em preaching the bible\nHe led a homie to Christ from his same hood\nPart of Church plant come on now ain't his name good\nThis is a blessing, I\u2019m stressing, but this is not the norm\nWe need leaders and believers to help carry it on\nBut who would minister in a sinister part of town\nI pray if Jesus is calling you, you would be found\n\n[Verse 2]\nEric used to go to bible study as a kid\nHe got older and started doing what the hood did\nA rival gang caught him slippin tried to take his life\nBut the jammed up so them beat him nice\nHe woke up in the hospital singing bible songs\nPraise God he had a place to learn the bible from\nBut then he gets saved and wanna preach Christ\nThey make him change his whole culture and way of life\nHe gotta get him a bachelors wear a suit and tie\nGo to seminary by then all of his boys will die\nJesus came to invade culture outta nazereth\nAnd used a couple fisherman who people saw as hazardous\nThe feet are beautiful if only they'd go\nIf ain't nobody in hood preaching how will they know?\nEric is better used taught trues in his context\nSomebody please plant a church in his projects\n\n[Verse 3]\nIn Luke 4:16 on down to 21\nJesus says he's messiah says hes the chosen one\nBut more than that he quotes Isaiah\nThat shows our savior targets oppressed captive blind and the broke I'm saying\nHad a heart for the poor had a heart for the low\nAnd 1st John 2:6 is way we should go\nIn Deuteronomy even tho they under the law\nThe tithes every third year the poor got em all\nI ain't sayin you wrong if you live in burbs\nI'm sayin turn your attention to the hood cause we hurting\nMan if you ain't burdened please pick up your word and\nTho this world is going down while we here we can serve him\nWe bring this to the streets because we knew the streets\nI pray that more would be burdened to have beautiful feet\nYou never knew the streets but truth is what you preach\nI pray to God you'd be burdened to those beautiful feet\nGo, go, go (run with those beautiful feet)\nGo, go, go\nYou hold the truth that saves so run and shout it to the world\nThey can't believe in something they ain't never heard\nGo, go, go and run with those beautiful feet"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
