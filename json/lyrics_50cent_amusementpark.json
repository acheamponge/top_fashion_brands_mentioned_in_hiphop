Yeah, it's like that\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow you can ride the horse around the carousel\nExplosions, Trojans, all in the hotel\nPut me to the test, girl, I don't fail\nI work it out without a doubt\nThere's plenty water rides, I'm sure to get you wet in the park\nHave your lusting seductions considered an art\nThrow a hoop around the bottle, I'll be your teddy bear\nWhatever color you like, you know I don't care\nI really wanna thank ya for attending this affair\nNow go encourage your friends to come have fun here\nI smile when I speak, but I'm being sincere\nAnd your pass is valid all summer, my dear\nSo at your convenience you can always return\nThere's so many tricks to the trade you should learn\nSuck that, lick that, swallow that lollipop\nForget that grip, that ride it nonstop\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2007-05-08"}]}
