turntables\nAnt Live I don't need you collectin the dough\nAnd Little Daddy since you my brother\nGet yo' ass on in here\nCause we gettin ready to take things down the line\nHere we go one time\n\nPrepare yourself for MC terror\nAnd don't make the error of tryin to come near a\nRapper so smooth and swift with the gift of gab\nTo grab the mic, cause I'm sorta like\nVincent Price, but you never been so nice\nSo back up off me, I'm seperatin men from mice\nKickin ass in every committee, city to city\nUntil both shoes are shitty\nThe regulator innovator dominator creator of data\nPlus an imitator assassinator\nLyrics don't display a too don sweet\nHard as concrete, and always on beat\nSteppin to this, you're not allowed\nYou keep frontin on the stage like you're rockin the crowd\nSnatchin the microphone real proud\nBut your rhymes are so booty you should write em on White Cloud\nSo next up down the line, Scrap Lover\n\n[Scrap Lover]\nAiy-aiy-yo, the microphone's mine\nBut I prefer peace, so the road'll get rough when\nA toy MC, gets the heart to pull a bluff and\nThere's no laughter, cause the one that I'm after\nIs smashed, for that reason you have to\nMake sure each and every lyric is harmless\nCause if not, you won't be able to calm this\nBrother from Brooklyn, made to fit a groove\nAnd prepared for the unexpected, to make a move\nSo put up your girl, and let's see who's in trouble troop\nAnd if you got a sister, then make it a double scoop\nThe capital S the C, the R-A-P\nStands for me, cause I'm the\nOnly MC with an original rap style\nYou disagree, you get put on the Scrap pile\nSo stay off the set, with George and Jet-son\nYou never seen a dancer who rapped well you met one\nNow spin the Wheel of Fortunes or be wise and stay back\nCo-host my show, like Pat and don't Sa-jak shit\nOr get ate like oats and barley\nSave your Sweat for Keith, and the Beef for Charlie\nSo next up, goin down the line, Scoob Lover\n\n[Scoob Lover]\nYo, the microphone's mine\nIt's the S y'all, to the C y'all, double-O B y'all\nWell god damn it's me y'all\nJump back, kiss myself, I'm so fly\nSip a brew or two, cause yo, I don't get high\nI might wave hi..\n.. at a pretty young girl that walk by\nBut yo, you all that, you can't stop?\nA-with the weave in your head like a mop?\nYou must know karate, cause your face look chopped\nNow back to the subject of the matter\nI eat a lot of food, but I won't get fatter\nLet me see I'm slim, my hair is well trimmed\nAnd when I'm low-key I throw on a brim\nBut I'm not conceited, when hangin out I need it\nFor when trouble comes then I never have to meet it\nI'm intellectually spoken, I'm not jokin\nWhat are you, smokin?\nYou be hopin wishin and prayin\nTo be like Scoob but what are you sayin?\nWell it takes style, charisma, class\nFuck up on the Lover, and I bust your ass\nSo next up, movin down the line\nMister Cee\n\n[Mister Cee]\nYo, the microphone's mine\nMission, to make DJ's feel the wrath\nSo here's a paragraph, written on behalf\nOf the ruler, dictator, DJ ambassador\nMakin a massacre, you couldn't last through a\nRound of combat, where my left arm's at\nMy mouth with the mic in my hand, when I attack\nI shake and bake or fake a snake\nTake em and make em ache and flake, I break like an earthquake\nWhen I erupt, MC's I corrupt, to be blunt\nI'mma tear shit up\nSo next up goin down the line\nThe Little Daddy Shane\n\n[Little Daddy Shane]\nThe mic is all mine\nMC's crawl by when they see this tall guy\nSix foot three huh, nobody's small fry\nThe Little D-A double-D Y\nThe S-H-A-N-E, yes it's me\nYou better believe there's no comp and I'm certain\nSo if you try to battle me, then it's cur-tains\nI'm no joke, the wrong one to provoke\nOne false move and KERRRRRR-ROAK!\nSo take it easy and slide on greasy\nCause I'm more rougher than hair when it's peasy\nI'm more rougher than steak when it's raw\nSo keep that in mind, mon cherie amore\nCause I'm a lover you find quite young\nAnd Brooklyn New York, is where I'm from\nSo keep it on and you don't quit\nThat supercalafragilisticexpalidopeshit\nSo next up down the line, Ant Live\n\n[Ant Live]\nYo, the microphone's mine\nYeah I took it, I ain't gonna give it back\nAnd it's a fact that I can swing, I'm not a new jack\nGot the mic in a chokehold, you won't hear a peep\nThen I put it to sleep\nI see a lot of brothers got raisins in the place\nNot Al Pacino, I don't need a Scarface\nBut I know, if some shit goes down\nI'll turn the whole New York into Bucktown\nA 'Face ain't real Scar'red, cause I real hard\nAnd I ain't no bullshit bodyguard\nWalk the streets to New York and stay alive\nAll I need is my loaded four-five\nAnd sweet and deadly like a killer beehive\nAnd I can stalk in Fort Greene Park and survive...\nAnd my name is Ant Live!\n\n[Big Daddy Kane]\nNow that's what I'm talkin bout\nThat's EXACTLY what I'm talkin bout\nPut your weight on it fellas\nAnyway you can get back to work now\nGet back to your god damn jobs\nAnd we outta here, love peace and hairgrease", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9018e5e448f4d08b6115d24de00e8af0.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year":
