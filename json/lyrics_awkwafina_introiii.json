I think we should go forward and take our first call\nKay everyone, let's welcome Ronnie from Sioux City, South Dakota\nEveryone, Ronnie\n\n[Ronnie]\nYo Doctor, doctor, wait, hol' up\nKill that music real quick\nKill that music, hol' up\nDoctor, my dick hurts so bad, I think I sat on it wrong last night\nI was doing pilates and I think I sat on my dick wrong and shit\nThat shit hurt so bad\nThis morning I woke up, I was in my bed\nWith my- with my shoes on- my shoes on- was still on\nAnd I was like 'my dick hurt though'\nI don't know why my dick hurt so bad\nI never had this hurt so much\nI was at the carnival two days ago\nI was at the carnival two days ago\nI was on a ride, I was goin' up and down\nBut my dick didn't hurt that day\nThat shirt hurt right now though\nLike I'm trying to go out\nI'm trying to go to the club\nBut my dick hurt so bad\nI could only hop on one foot\nWit' my- wit' my other foot behind my head\nAnd I could hop a little\nI can't walk like no normal person\nI'm on the street and everyone like\n'Look at that, why his dick hurt so bad?'\nI can't even sit here watch Bones\nI can't even watch Bones right now\n'Cause my dick hurt so bad\n\n[Radio Host]\nOkay...okay. Let's cut this- Let's cut- Let's- Let's- Let's cut this\nLet's cut- okay...\nI don't know what that was\nI think Ronnie might have had the wrong number there\nAh... but you know what?\nWe could look at that call as maybe his dick...uh...\nAs a metaphor for his heart\nAnd how maybe his heart heart hurt so bad\nAs opposed to his genital extremities\nUh... let's take- let's take one more call\nThis is Carla.. Carla from... from Portland, Oregon\nCarla from Portland, Oregon\n\n[Ronnie]\nNah, nah\nThis is Ronnie again 'cuz listen\nI don't know why y'all hangin' up\n'Cause in second grade I had two gerbils\nOne was named Fufu and the other one was named Joe\nAnd they both died at the same time\nAnd I felt so much pain at that time\nAnd now only that pain can be paralleled\nWith the way that my dick hurt right now\nBasically like- like if my my dick was a volcano\nAnd pain was the lava inside that volcano\nBasically my dick is... basically uh...\nPretty much swimmin' in that lava\nLike this is Pompeii\nLike in my pants is Pompeii\nAnd like I'ma tell you the truth\nBecause when I go to American Eagle\nI feel like sometimes that make my dick hurt more\nIn like a- In like a mental way\nBut I'm saying right now that my dick hurt so bad\nAnd I'm tryna just go down the street\nI'm tryna go to Duncan Donuts\nGet me some of them-\nSome of them hash brown\nSome of them circular hash brown\nWith some coconut iced coffee\nSo I can start my day\nI don't know if I told you\nBut I'm writing this book on- on-\nIt's like a romance book\nIt's kinda like Don Quijote\nBut more of like of- of-\nOf like- like  a vampire horror fiction\nI'm tryna write that book\nI'm tryna go to Starbucks\nDrink my Duncan Donuts in Starbucks\nBut my dick hurt so bad\nI can't even- I can't even walk to the stove right now\nLike I'm talkin' like I can't even go to Red Lobster\nAnd have me no clams- cassino\nBecause my dick is like the Clams Casino\nOf like my nipples\nDoes that make any sense?\n'Cause I can't even watch Bones\nI'm just tryna watch some Bones\nAnd my dick hurt so bad\nI can't even watch no bones\n\n[Radio Host]\nOkay...
