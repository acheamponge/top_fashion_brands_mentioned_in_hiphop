It's just my dream\nShit I figured you was good, homie serve fiends\nSo you see me in the club, wanna look mean\nLike you just drunk a whole fifth of Jim Beam\nBe easy, here's what you do, find yourself a lil' breezy\nTake her to the flo', let yourself go\nDrink a lil' mo', here's a lil' mo'\nIf she backing up then give her what she ask for\nI just came to have a good old time\nDon't start no shit, don't say no rhymes\nIf you see me kicking something then it's not mine\nCause a party ain't a party 'til you party with dimes\n\n[Hook X2: Darien Brockington]\n\n[Rapper Big Pooh]\nUh, all work, no play\nLeads to letting yourself loose at the end of the day\nCouple shots of Marnier take your trouble away\nKeep tipping the bartender, you just doubled her pay\nNow headed for the exit but she want you to stay\nWanna pass a CD that she want you to play\nOK, maybe later on, not here\nEverybody claim that this year is they year\nIf that so, let's get a few things clear\nThis exactly why Poobie came here\nTo shake a leg, sip barre\nNot to put you on or become your A&R\nNot to take your CD looking for a star\nReal rap nigga, I ain't made it that far y'know\nSo, grab one, have fun, it's allowed\nNo more demos getting passed in the crowd\n\n[Darien Brockington]\nI just wanna have fun, yeah\nGrab a drink and hit the dance floor\nJust might get another drink and dance a little longer\nI'm all danced but I can dance more\n...what I came here for\n\n[Hook X2: Darien Brockington]\n\n[Darien Brockington]\nYou like, move just how you liiiiike\nOooooh-oh-oh-oh"}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
