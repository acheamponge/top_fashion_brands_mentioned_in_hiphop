CALI\nIt's hard to live in... CALI\nHard to survive in... CALI\nCause you could die in... CALI\nA lot of sun in cali\nI keep a gun in cali\nSo watch your tounge in... CALI\nCause you'll get done in cali\n\n[Verse 1:]\nThey call me Ya Boy\nI'm representin' Northern... (CALI)\nAnd that's where them young boys is gettin' shot and tallied\nI'm from that state of dat brown bag\nIf you ain't from 'round here, get pound here, play with' 4 pounds here\nAnd young nigga's push work by the pound in... (CALI)\nYeah we get down in cali, leave 'em in the ground in cali\nI'm from the state where they slang rock's and hate cop's\nRoll the turf, skate block's, never will the case stop\nI'm from the state where they crippin' and they bloodin' at\nAnd if they can't find you, they go to where ya cousin at\nAnd ain't no squares here, a lot of playa's here\nThe chronic shit, we high as the Hemalias here\nAnd nigga's play with' chopper's, a lot of crooked copper's\nWe call 'em hood rat's, Texas call 'em boppers\nThrow up ya finger's, if ya feel the same way\nYa Boy puttin' it down for CALI-FORN-IA\nWhere you from?\n\n[Chorus: x2]\nI represent in... CALI\nIt's hard to live in... CALI\nHard to survive in... CALI\nCause you could die in... CALI\nA lot of sun in cali\nI keep a gun in cali\nSo watch your tounge in... CALI\nCause you'll get done in cali\n\n[Verse 2:]\nThis here's a shady place, rest in peace Tookie\nI guess the Terminator really wasn't just a movie\nThe dealer's give the yay, the killer's get away\nA snitch is very lucky, if he can live another day\nThe Giant's vs. the Dodger's\nThe Raider's vs. the 9ner's\nEither you small grindin', or you a big timer\nWe wearin' black tees, gold teeth, and bandanas\nWe push zip's, fuck model chick's, and tote hammers\nWe get a lot of dough, like Digiorno\nYou see them Bentley coupes, We can afford those\nWhere if you live another day, only the lord know's\nWherever the money at, It's where the whore's go\nWe call them gold digger's, and it's a lot of those\nThe feds really bull, they wearing cheap clothes\nThe state of California, where we don't get along\nI'm bringin' you to cali, just listen to the song\n\n[Chorus: x2]\nI represent in... CALI\nIt's hard to live in... CALI\nHard to survive in... CALI\nCause you could die in... CALI\nA lot of sun in cali\nI keep a gun in cali\nSo watch your tounge in... CALI\nCause you'll get done in cali\n\n[Verse 3:]\nI'm from the Bay, still L.A. love Ya Boy\nAsk my nigga Spence, We straight thuggin' boy\nI got the street's turned higher then the oven boy\nI'm from the west, still look like a southern boy\nWe on them big wheel's, I'm in that fast drop\nJust got the black coupe equipped with the stash spot\nSome nigga's ride spinner's, some niggas ride rallies\nJust keep ya thang tucked\nBecause it's... Because it's...\n\n[Chorus:]\nIt's hard to live in... CALI\nI represent in... CALI\nHard to survive in... CALI\nCause you could die in... CALI\nA lot of sun in cali\nI keep a gun in cali\nSo watch your tounge in... CALI\nCause you'll get done in cali\n\nI represent in... CALI\nIt's hard to live in... CALI\nHard to survive in... CALI\nCause you could die in... CALI\nA lot of sun in cali\nI keep a gun in cali\nSo watch your tounge in... CALI\nCause you'll get done in cali", "title": "Cali"}]}
