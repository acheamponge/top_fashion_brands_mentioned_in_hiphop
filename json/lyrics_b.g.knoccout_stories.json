That\u2019s either one of two things\nYou\u2019re either somebody or you\u2019re nobody.\u201d\n\nWoke up to a call about 7:30\nThe plug said he gonna send a package early\nI sent the money knowing he was trustworthy\nNext couple days came and I ain\u2019t had nothing but frustration\nOut here checking other folks\u2019 mail\nWhen I called this nigga phone it\u2019s going straight to voice mail\nI know he ain\u2019t gonna cross me like his boy did\nI\u2019ll fuck around and chop him up\nAnd throw him off a bridge\nCheck it damn he block me even on that hoe shit\nGot on my girl phone quick and I requested him\nCouple minutes later he accepted it\nAnd so now I\u2019m about to wreck some shit\nI gotta find out where it went sour at\nMight pop up at  his crib\nAnd pop a 40 to his shower cap\n\nBut instead I let an hour pass\nSeem like in all her pictures she was shaped like an hour glass\nTwo hours back I\u2019m checking the location of his latest snap\nSo I can pop up on that nigga and see where it go from there\nHe telling me he sent it but\nWithout a cap or that pistol on my hip\nShot him in his fucking chest\n\nDrove back to the house to see the package there\n\nDamn!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f53bc2513f951592f3d34d0e92b5e0ad.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2017-07-09"}]}
