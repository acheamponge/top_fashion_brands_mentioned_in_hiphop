still got my rich nigga grin (we get 'em in, get 'em in)\nStill got my rich nigga grin (we get 'em in, get 'em in)\n\nFuck you jealous ass hoes that wanna see a nigga broke\nFuck the plug if he holding back dope\nStill got my rich nigga grin (we get 'em in, get 'em in)\nStill got my rich nigga grin (we get 'em in, get 'em in)\n\n[Verse 1: Payroll Giovanni]\nFuck niggas and fuck these bitches\nMan, I switch 'em like whips I don't love these bitches\nBaby girl was frowning like she was down dog\nSoon as we split up, now she praying on my downfall\nBut I'm still working, tell these hoes how I came up\nWhy you run around broke as shit with these lame fucks\nCause everybody off they're had snake tendencies\nBoy, you ain't my mans you a motherfucking enemy\nScammed a couple bands on me back when I was 19\nSelling caine in Canada, serving all the dope fiends\nTried to put you on, but you turned into a bitch nigga\nYou prolly wake up and can't look in the fucking mirror\nThe way these niggas hating you'll think they getting paid\nBut I know that ain't the case cause they looking like ashamed\nI still keep my head up, I still get it in\nAnd hit these niggas and these bitches with my rich nigga grin\n\n[Hook: Payroll Giovanni]\nBitches tryna stress me\nSetup hoes tryna sex me\nHating niggas wanna wet me\nBut I still got my rich nigga grin(we get 'em in, get 'em in)\nStill got my rich nigga grin(we get 'em in, get 'em in)\nFuck you jealous ass hoes that wanna see a nigga broke\nFuck the plug if he holding back dope\nStill got my rich nigga grin(we get 'em in, get 'em in)\nStill got my rich nigga grin(we get 'em in, get 'em in)\n\n[Verse 2: Kiddo]\nMy baby mama tripping say she need some love\nI gave her ass a 20, she went to the club\nI heard she got drunk, fucking with the scrubs\nIt's time to stop smiling and put on my mug\nGucci belt, my shirt tucked, I'm looking at the judge\nShe checking out my tats and now she hold a grudge\nShe wanna lock me up me up cause I'm a fucking thug\nWell fuck you too, let me put on my mug\nWalked out the court room, then hopped in the whip\nOn probation but I'm still smoking out the zip\nBitch get at me, I'm still happy\nCause I make my money stretch like Laffy Taffy\nThey wanna clap me\nCause they knew I was gonna be a boss since the class of Miss Slappey's\nI wanna take the burner from my khakis\nBut the burner to his acne\nBut I'ma kill 'em with a grin while I'm up the candle\n\n[Hook: Payroll Giovanni]\nBitches tryna stress me\nSetup hoes tryna sex me\nHating niggas wanna wet me\nBut I still got my rich nigga grin (we get 'em in, get 'em in)\nStill got my rich nigga grin (we get 'em in, get 'em in)\nFuck you jealous ass hoes that wanna see a nigga broke\nFuck the plug if he holding back dope\nStill got my rich nigga grin (we get 'em in, get 'em in)\nStill got my rich nigga grin (we get 'em in, get 'em in)\n\n[Verse 3: Big Quis]\nCrispy\nThis rap shit got us beefing with a bunch of nobodies\nWe gettin' big nigga, we just opened up for Yo Gotti\nMy job is making money, making niggas mad is my hobby\nHow you from the Mile bitch, and you don't know everybody?\nYou can catch me up at Horney, shooting pool with the OG's\nOr on the block pouring shots, back while we roll D's\nI tried to be lowkey, but nigga I can't\nI'm iced up and ain't a nigga on my team who ain't\nThey act like we ain't winnin' but I know we ain't losin'\nAnd if we is, I can tell how they bitches be choosin'\nI'm in the club, jewels shining, mink on just fooling\nAnd them 4 Life niggas with me, if you try me you stupid\nAll the rich niggas love us but the broke niggas hating\nThese stupid motherfuckers really should be proud if we make it\nBut fuck 'em they just jealous\nIt ain't shit I can take it\nThey just gettin' that rich nigga grin\nAnd throw my chain in they faces, for life\n\n[Hook: Payroll Giovanni]\nBitches tryna stress me\nSetup hoes tryna sex me\nHating niggas wanna wet me\nBut I still got my rich nigga grin (we get 'em in, get 'em in)\nStill got my rich nigga grin (we get 'em in, get 'em in)\nFuck you jealous ass hoes that wanna see a nigga broke\nFuck the plug if he holding back dope\nStill got my rich nigga grin (we get 'em in, get 'em in)\nStill got my rich nigga grin (we get 'em in, get 'em in)\n\n[Verse 4: Doughboy Roc]\nI can't give you haters the benefit of the doubt\nI got money and her, niggas know what I'm 'bout\nBut yet they still wanna play\nNiggas stress with the K\nI remain with a rich grin and nothing to say\nMan, these niggas be hating, I can't get to elaboratin'\nWhen I hop in the booth it's all facts, no fabricating\nIf I rap it, I live it\nHear my laugh for the ticket\nGotta go back to court, in 2 months to get sentenced\nAnd my family don't understand, this life that I'm living\nMy bitch trippin' and the prosecutors want me in prison\nWhat I'm supposed to do, go give them pussy niggas passes\nI got God on my side, so I'ma rise above madness\nMade a lot of mistakes, niggas open my eyes\nBut I'm too real out to this bitch so it was like a surprise\nHit my knees and asked the man above, forgive me for my sins\nPray I get to heaven with my rich nigga grin\n\n[Hook: Payroll Giovanni]\nBitches tryna stress me\nSetup hoes tryna sex me\nHating niggas wanna wet me\nBut I still got my rich nigga grin (we get 'em in, get 'em in)\nStill got my rich nigga grin (we get 'em in, get 'em in)\nFuck you jealous ass hoes that wanna see a nigga broke\nFuck the plug if he holding back dope\nStill got my rich nigga grin (we get 'em in, get 'em in)\nStill got my rich nigga grin (we get 'em in, get 'em in)"}]}
