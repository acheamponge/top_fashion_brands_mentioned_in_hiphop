Blige know what I'm sayin\nBut the odds are still against me, I'm making paper\nAnd still need that one, That wants to be with me\nAnd not for the money, Nor the fame, But for me\nOne who can give me that security\nSo if you're out there this one's for you\nYou'll be down with me, then maybe I'll be true\nYou see I'm kinda like 2 Pac, When I get around\nBut the ICE goes down", "album": "Mind Blowin", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f7a76335917daad02db3cc269ea9667e.498x500x1.jpg"}]}
