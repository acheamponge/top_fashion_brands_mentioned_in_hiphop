Get to know me\nDon't proceed with drama\n[Goldy]\nBitches be talking like parrots\n14 karats of Goldy--\nYou never saw me\nYou never know me\n'Cause  you only blow me\nPut your head in my lap\nI got you dead in my trap\n'Cause you ain't feeling what I'm feelin'\nAnd what I said in my rap\nI want to saddle up\nAnd get behind that ass you got\nSay \"Good Day\" and blast off\nLike an astronaut\nAnd let you gossip\nWhile I sip\nHendu, Cahlua and Bailey's Cream\nAnd wonder why you say these things\nGary Payton got jacked for his 'lex, man\nHe earned that. Let him sport it like the next man\nThey didn't want to see us come from rags to riches--\nThey got jealous and turned straight fags and snitches\n[Both]\nWe got love for the Town that we came from--\nGot our game from--\nBut we can't beat the same drum\nSo if you don't see us riding like we used to ride\nDon't trip because we ain't local-- now we nationwide\nWe just want to live a player lifestyle\nWith new hoes, a new houses--\nFuck a wife now\nWe still kicks it in the town the hard way\nBut in Atlanta, G.A\nWe likes to parlay...\n\n[end]", "year": "1994-06-14"}]}
