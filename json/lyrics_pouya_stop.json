Make that bitch feel at home\nJuggin up out my phone, talking that money\nThe ho, you can leave me low\nCold like a Frosty cone, left in the freezer for two hundred years\nDo it for me, and all of my peers\nTo all of the struggle and all of the tears\nAll of the blood and the feeling of fear\nWe finna make it just give me a year\n\n[Chorus]\nStop, all of that bullshit that you talking about\nQuit, all of that nonsense coming out of your mouth\nFLA, I'm a Stunna coming straight out the south\nThey been sleeping on me, so the beast inside me Imma let that boy out\nStop, all of that bullshit that you talking about\nQuit, all of that nonsense coming out of your mouth\nFLA, I'm a Stunna coming straight out the south\nThey been sleeping on me, so the beast inside me Imma let that boy out\n\n[Verse 2: Mike G]\nFinish Him\nI'm a rider, take me higher\nI been told you I spit fire\nYou keep hiding, Imma find ya\nNeed my money on arrival\nCrowds keep bouncing, I move mountains\nI got flow like waterfountains\nHolding gems, I got vaults of them\nImma show you what my crews about\nSee since summer '09, I never stopped grinding\nSucces is the only outcome I got time for\nYou holding me up? Then you get knocked down\nAnd that's a fact like fiction was not in my options\nI need the water, my total control\nAnything other can be put on hold\nShout out to my brother Pouya, you cold\nI make thousands, tryna make gold\nAnd now they standing in line, just to hear all these rhymes\nYou gotta get yours, I gotta get mine\nBut I can snatch both if you give me the time\nThese shades I got on, you can't stop my shine\nTalking Grammys and such, you going to pay me or what?\nIf anyone want, we can meet in the front\nBut I'm up for peace, I'm beyond your reach\nA heaven to hold and too much to touch\nKnow where you going, the future is written\nFocus on your mission, you fly with your visions\nApply what you're listing, cause doing is way more effective than wishing\nWe killed it with this one", "year": "2014-03-05"}]}
