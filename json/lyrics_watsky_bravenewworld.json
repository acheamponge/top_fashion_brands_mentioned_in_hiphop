(Oh my Gooood!)\nTwo fleets keep peace on the mean streets\nOne treats brown people like they\u2019re beastly\nNothing like the force that police me (That\u2019s so oooodd!)\nWhat\u2019s the fate of the species?\nGet a metal plate and then mate with the PCs\nOr retreat back to a monkey chucking feces?\n(What\u2019s the deeeeal?) Wanna ease this pain\nDifferent than the BC years\nNow we BCC Jesus on the email chain\nWay too many threats to flee\nWay too many heads to feed\nNot too many beds to sleep\nChief said that it was best you leave\n\"F you, please\" to the refugees\nAnd it\u2019s seeming like it\u2019s every other day that I been tugging at my collar, thinking, \u201cDamn, it\u2019s toasty!\u201d\nWhere did all the people at the supermarket go\nThat used to scan my groceries? Vanished mostly\nAnd wassup with all the homies with the camo and the ammo in the rifles on their shoulder\nWalking through the city, thinking that they\u2019re Annie Oakley?\nThat\u2019s quite enough\nBut this shit is fucking unbelievable\nI swear you couldn\u2019t write this stuff\n\n[Chorus]\nEverywhere that I stare (Veneficia!)\nYou couldn\u2019t write this shit, no\nEvery minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)\nAnother fantasy is brought to life\nEverywhere that I stare (Science Fiction!)\nYou couldn\u2019t write this shit, no\nEvery minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)\nAnd now I never get surprised\n\n[Verse 2]\nYoung George Jetson stepping up in this motherfucker\nGripping a butcher knife, hoping I can cut the chord\nWhere the horde is plugged to the motherboard\nThat is not a legitimate hoverboard (Shit\u2019s got wheels!)\nI Iook at the sky, saying \u201cMy God, run!\u201d\nLife\u2019s heavier than an iPod one\nMy Twitter ain\u2019t gonna matter when the tripods come\n(Let\u2019s get real!) From the hieroglyphs to the crowded malls\nNever mind the if, but the how it falls\nI\u2019m vibing out watching Ow! My Balls (Oh yeaaaah)\nCore defects tend to wreck my sleep\nThe quest to be more perfect than Ford Prefect\nWhile I\u2019m dreaming of Electric Sheep\n\u2018Cause Soylent Green is people, resistance is just futile\nPop a red pill and a blue pill and I dilate my pupils\nMoving light speed, we all got vile needs\nLiving is a violent deed\nSpread my soul like Wild Seed\nWhy would it be any wonder I act weird?\nI\u2019m trying to find out who the fuck I am\nWhile looking in a cracked Black Mirror\nYou got a finish what you thought about?\nHow this is gotta bottom out?\nYou wanna flee the reaper, but they\u2019re bombing the city\nAnd the single haven to creep in is the slaughterhouse\n\n[Chorus]\nEverywhere that I stare (Veneficia!)\nYou couldn\u2019t write this shit, no\nEvery minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)\nAnother fantasy is brought to life\nEverywhere that I stare (Seven trumpets!)\nYou couldn\u2019t write this shit, no\nEvery minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)\nAnd now I never get surprised\nEverywhere that I stare (Veneficia!)\nYou couldn\u2019t write this shit, no\nEvery minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)\nAnother fantasy is brought to life\nEverywhere that I stare (Veneficia!)\nYou couldn\u2019t write this shit, no\nEvery minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)\nAnd now I never get surprised", "image": "https://images.genius.com/caf3c17709b04ff24300da4d62da46fa.630x630x1.jpg", "album": "x INFINITY", "title": "Brave New World"}]}
