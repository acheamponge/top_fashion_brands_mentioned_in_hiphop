Keep it on the D'lo\nYoungins stick to the G code\nThat lil money have you caught up in ya Ego\nTurnin on ya mans like Tony did Chico\nBetta stack and invest. See what happened ta Fresh\nSee what happened ta Ace. You betta keep you a tek\nUh, what would you do for a check? Put work in ya trunk?\nGet chu ten, nothin less\nLook, started wit a dollar. Trappin in my pradas\nGot the block jumpin. Feds pull up in Impalas\nMy youngins on the lookout. When they see em, they jus holla. Work fa 12 hours, I toss em a hunnid dollars now\nReal life, true shit, this real shit. Take you through the block like a field trip, I live this\nYea, I was really trappin in that cold\nHad that 7 dollar dro. Feet froze, so I closed"}], "artist": "Lil Bibby"}
