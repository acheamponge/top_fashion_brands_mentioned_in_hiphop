F*** the coppers, the mind of a kilo shopper\nSeein' my life through the windshields of choppers\nI ain't spend one rap dollar in 3 years, holla\nMoney's the least, drag a b**** by her dog collar\nNow *** folla', this is my ghetto story\nLike Cham, Ice-P is the Don Dotta\nOpen the Frigidaire, 25 to life in here\nSo much white you might think ya Holy Christ is near\nThrow on your Louis V millionaires to kill the glare\nIce trays, Nada, all you see is pigeons paired\nThe realest s*** I ever wrote, not Pac inspired\nIt's crack pot inspired, my real n***** quote\nB**** never cook my ***, why? Never trust a ho with your child\nAt you make believe rappers I smile, ha\nCanals treatin' my style, like you Internet sharing my files\nYou're my space n******\nSo kill the comparison, I'm South Beach sippin' on Sara Fin'\nWellfy check n****, I never been, *** money clean through Maryland\nShit, countin' just gasp at the smell of it\nMeet the dealer, ain't a b**** realer\nSo you ain't gotta question why Pusha don't feel ya\nNow get the f*** off\nKeys open doors, keys open doors\nKeys open doors, keys, keys open doors\nKeys open doors, keys open doors\nKeys open doors, keys, keys open doors\nKeys open doors, keys open doors\nKeys open doors, keys, keys open doors\nYeah, check it\nKeys open doors, keys, keys open doors\nThrow it on the scale, feed ya *** self\nGet it how you live, we don't ask for help, no\nWord on the street is you gon' love how it melt\nAnd I don't come with a pitch neither, the s*** sell itself\nI yell re-up 'til I'm locked like ma-mia\nAnd get it cross the state with the grace of Maria\nKeep on toys, you gon' know us when you see us\nLiving street tales worthy of Don Divas\nK*** in the floor, mistress in Dior\nBitch tell me she love me, but I know she's a ***\nShit could get ugly, *** she talk to the Lord now\nIt's just what I get, it's the roses of war\n*** the bureau, rather be spending Euros\nAnd get fed grapes, *** *** in plurals\nJust like Heaven as I gaze at the mural\nWhat a piece of mind when you copy some Shapiro's\nCheers to the future as we toast to life\nI'm preventing Miami, I'm a socialite, n****\nThe cars is big, the cribs is bigger\nThe kids are happy, the perfect picture\nGem star razor, the fruit of my labor\nAnd I walk with a glow, it's like the Lord's shown favor\nThese b***** fake like the h*** on flavor\nBut I don't mind spending, all it is is paper, yes\nKeys open doors, keys open doors\nKeys open doors, keys, keys open doors\nKeys open doors, keys open doors\nKeys open doors, keys, keys open doors\nKeys open doors, keys open doors\nKeys open doors, keys, keys open doors\nKeys open doors, keys, keys open doors"}], "artist": "Clipse"}
