Rud and I came to get down\nI'm not internationally known\nBut it's smart to leave your girl at home\nI'm on and off the chain\nGoing through withdrawals like I'm off the c'aine\nPsyche! I know what you like\nMe on the mic\nPlus DeShay beats\nAnd a whole night full of free drinks\nBut I know what ya'll all been asking\nHow a kid so young so classic?\nHow the kid so dope with no coke?\nHow the North Face coat so fashion?\nWell it's just my passion\nWith enough work, then I just might cash in\nOne fifty five on the dash, in the SLK\nWith the slate-gray paint, with a boo like Aladdin\n\n[Chorus (2x): Tommy Parker]\nYou might be the one that I'm looking for\nSo baby let's hit the floor\nYou know you make my heart stop\nLet's see where this thing can go\n'Cause baby, you're in control\n'Cause baby, you're in control\n'Cause baby, you're in control\n'Cause baby, you're it\n\n[Verse 2: Chill3D]\nMan, I must've been out of my brain\n'Cause hair and the nails with a body insane\nHelp the penetration of my mainframe\nCaught in a daze, I'm just trying to maintain\nShe's a virus in my system\nGot me sitting here, glitching, twitching\nFeeling like I'm stuck in intermission\nLost in space and I'm in a new dimension\nMan, 'cause it's the flashing lights\nGot me thinking you the prototype\nLet me get a drink I know you like\nNow let's sway to the beat all night\nCall me MJ baby, wanna rock with you\nIn a Led Zeppelin, Joe Cocker mood\nYeah, your lips send me up like Spock will do\nYou coming through, so make it so number two\n\n[Chorus (2x): Tommy Parker]\nYou might be the one that I'm looking for\nSo baby let's hit the floor\nYou know you make my heart stop\nLet's see where this thing can go\n'Cause baby, you're in control\n'Cause baby, you're in control\n'Cause baby, you're in control\n'Cause baby, you're it\n\n[Bridge: Tommy Parker]\nI tried to find what's really right\nWhat's best for me in my life right now, you could be the one\nJust come and meet me up on the floor, work it here until you get sore\n'Cause baby, you're it\nI tried to find what's really right\nWhat's best for me in my life right now, you could be the one\nJust come and meet me up on the floor, work it here until you get sore\n'Cause baby, you're it\n\n[Chorus (2x): Tommy Parker]\nYou might be the one that I'm looking for\nSo baby let's hit the floor\nYou know you make my heart stop\nLet's see where this thing can go\n'Cause baby, you're in control\n'Cause baby, you're in control\n'Cause baby, you're in control\n'Cause baby, you're it", "year": "2008-08-26", "album": "Volume: One!
