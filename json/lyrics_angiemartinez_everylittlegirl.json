It might work\"\nI wasn't satisfied, but it would just begin\nCause in ninety-five\nI was every day, six to ten\n\nI put in a lot of work so I could bring in my listeners\nI secured a fanbase\nAlthough some of them dissed us\nI was new at my thang\nBut I was doin my thang\nAnd I would never let nobody try to ruin my thang\nBut of course, there were people couldn't stand where I was\n\nCause although know I'm in\nI wasn't made what I was\nThrough the heat, kept it moving\nThrow the haters a smile\nWhat would they do if they knew her heart was fragile?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[The Product G&B]\nAngela.. (uh-huh)\nAngela.. (hahahah)\nAngela.. (wooh!)\nAngela.. (uhh, uhh)\n\n[Angie Martinez]\nOverall, it's a rough business\nIt could stop even you\nThere's people that's gonna say things that's not even true\nLike the one about me not bein down for my women\nAnd I hated the lesbian rumors that went around for a minute\nHow bout the one that goes, 'Yeah, she goes with him\nHe bought her the car, the ice, the clothes and rims.'\nAnd I'm sure you all heard she caught one dead in the face\n\nIt'd been different if she said what she said to my face\nAs for men\nWho knows where my story will start\nI went through a relationship that nearly tore me apart\n\nSo I'm chillin for now\nIt's all about me for the moment\nCause there's things that I wouldn't allow\nBut I'mma be aight though, keep comin with tight flow\nTry to stay on the low while I'm watchin your hype grow\nPlayin the role like nobody can cramp your style\nBut I know, like you know, that you're fragile\n\n[Hook]\n\n{\u200b*The Product G&B ad lib to the end*}\u200b", "year": null}]}
