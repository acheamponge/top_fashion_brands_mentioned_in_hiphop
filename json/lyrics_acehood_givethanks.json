Look how the neck glow\nI'm with the lit gang, you with them lame lames\nFour, three, two, one, call it a ball game\nCountin' blessings, since an adolescent, I've been really destined for the greatest\nI just give 'em motivation, I be speakin' revelation\nNigga started in the basement, I handle bars like a waitress\nPeople tell me I'm the chosen, gotta keep it focused, runnin' outta patience\nHN on the logo, real ones, no pretendo\nNo games, no Nintendo, don't you open up the window\nGod damn, I'm fresh, God damn, she sexy\nYou for certain that she yours? I bet tomorrow she text me\n\n[Hook]\nRollie with the new face\nPocket full of blue faces\nOver-fillin' my safe\nOver-workin' my faith\nI just got to give thanks\nI just got to give thanks\nWe just havin' our way\nI just gotta give thanks\nEverythin' champagne\nVVS's my change\nWay too blessed to complain\nWay too blessed to complain\nGive thanks, give thanks\n\n[Outro]\nDevil, get off me\nDevil, get off me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c89b57d32e8668a04af9e234ecf304ec.355x355x1.jpg"}]}
