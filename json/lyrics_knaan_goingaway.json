Are you going away?\nAre you going away? Are you going away?\n\nNelly: Remember?\n\nK'naan: Remember there was that one summer you went away to school?\nNelly: My parents got a new job and I had to change schools\nK'naan: And there was that one time you went away to camp?\nNelly: Letters everyday until I got back\n\nK'naan: But, you said 'I'll keep in touch' but my life got too rough\nNelly: You were always so touched\nK'naan: Well, I guess I had enough\n\nNelly: That day, in the misty morning\nWas it you, behind me, calling?\nRemember when we used to swing in the lawn and\nSing that song 'till one of us would fall\n\nTogether: Lalalalala, etc\n\nAre you going away? Are you going away?\nAre you going away? Are you going away?\nAre you going away? Are you going away?\nAre you going away? Are you going away?\nAre you going away? Are you going away?\n\nI think I saw you on the bus today\nI think I felt you in the wind today\nI think I saw you in the street today\nI think I felt you in the trees today\nI think I felt you in the rain today\nI think I saw you in the grocery store\nI saw you in the back of the cab\nI saw in the back of that cab\n\nAnyways, guess I'm going away\nGuess I'm going away (Bye bye)\nGuess I'm going away\nGuess I'm going away"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
