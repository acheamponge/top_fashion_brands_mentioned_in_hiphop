Oh girl\nDid I seem to give you a little bit more love?\nTo your gloomy life, to your empty life\nLittle life, little lie, oh yea\nDo you feel like you got your money's worth?\nCause if you did this round's on me\nJust promise that you'll come back to me\nFeed me, baby, feed me, baby\n\n[Hook]\nYour hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute\nI was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah\nSaid nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished\nI freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, ooh yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3cd68c66d12d757c908ddbdcefb581e8.441x441x1.jpg", "album": null, "title": "Odd Look"}]}
