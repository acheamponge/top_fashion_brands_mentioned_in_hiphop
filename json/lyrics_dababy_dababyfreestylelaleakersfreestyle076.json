{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse]\nWho shot your homeboy? A nigga with a diaper on?\nGot on the City Girls beat and got a cypher on?\nYour girl said she diggin' with DaBaby, right or wrong?\nJust gave me head in the rental car while the lights was on\nYou know me, I be chillin\u2019 and coolin', know I'm the shit with the music\nSince you in love with computers, go look my name up on Google\nAnd please don\u2019t turn to no groupie, others niggas be goofy\nMight as well get some popcorn, we finna make this a movie\nSomewhere laid up with a stallion, lettin' them haters hate\nEatin' jumbo shrimp with the steak off of a paper plate\nBallin' on 'em like Michael Jordan back in '88\nGot my dick sucked before my flight, it almost made me late\nI'm in a different bracket than rappers, these niggas can't relate\nDon\u2019t make me get to slappin\u2019 these rappers, give 'em a change of face\nMade so many racks off of trappin\u2019, say I was slangin' weight\nPut the weed down and start eatin', they say I'm gainin\u2019 weight\nWho shot ya? That lil' nigga with the pamper baby?\nWith twenty pounds of Cali weed inside the hamper baby?\nYour girl said she throw the- ah ah ah\nI pull up with the bald fade like a camper, ah\nWho shot ya? That lil' nigga be on Instagram?\nDo what the fuck he want to do like he don't give a damn?\nJust got some head outside the show inside the sprinter van\nThey say I'm a fool 'cause I'm coolin', smooth as a ceiling fan\nYou need to get your boss, I ain't tryin' to talk to no middleman\nI'm chargin' just to talk, nothin' personal, I'm a businessman, huh", "album": "LA Leakers Freestyles", "year": "2019-03-26", "title": "DaBaby Freestyle | LA Leakers Freestyle #076", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9c8ab0f889edaf0af99dc422c1d45cf7.1000x563x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DaBaby"}
