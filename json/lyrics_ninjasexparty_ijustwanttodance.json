Watch me go!\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've banged a thousand hotter girls\nThan the hottest girl you've ever seen\nI'll ninja-thrust and take you to orgasmic places\nYou have never been\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I don't want romance\nOr any dalliance\nSo button up your pants\n'Cause I just wanna\nI just wanna dance\n\n[Chorus]\nYou gotta believe I'm dancing\nJesus the Christ, I'm dancing\nI now believe in God"}], "artist": "Ninja Sex Party"}
