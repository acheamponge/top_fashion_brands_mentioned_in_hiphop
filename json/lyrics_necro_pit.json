Smack em with a bat\nHack em into pieces, Jesus, Christ motherfuckers are pussy\nPetrified, mortified, testified you all die\nI\u2019m the sort of guy that stays fortified\nWith a vest and a .45 wounds cauterized\nGoons on the rise rebellion, one million felons yelling, \u201cNecro, tell em!\u201d\nTo hell with them, fuck politics\nBuck at the cops, they can suck the cock\n\n[Hook]\n\nStart a pit! Do it! Now! Yeah!\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nHere\u2019s a shank and a snuff, stop acting tough\nI don\u2019t like you, you\u2019re not gangster enough\nI\u2019m at peace with reality, I got a blood feast mentality\nYou\u2019re into bestiality, you fuck dogs and you suck logs\nYou\u2019re into buttplugs, you don\u2019t need drugs\nSo nice I\u2019ll buck you up with a flare gun\nFuck you up in a fair one, stomp you with Air Ones\nYou get carried away, you literally get carried away on a stretcher pitifully\nMy bad your honour, I know I fucked up\nBut killing a cop is a badge of honour\nYou\u2019re a queer in tights, dying like a deer in headlights\nStrict with the nine like dead mice\nFinally put your brain to sleep painfully\nKill you and laugh at you simultaneously\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nVintage, you\u2019re cutting edge in one package\nGun-clappers backwards like a sexually active attractive nun with a strap-on\nCrucifix dildo haunting the chapel\nPeople you don\u2019t want to street brawl or you\u2019ll bleed\nAll over the place like I hit your nose with a speed ball\nLike a psycho in jail with the brain of Michael Dell\nHit your brain with a rifle shell\nShit like an ex-lax pill, crack your skull\nI\u2019ll flip out like Axl Rose on Paxil\nDon\u2019t need Source or XXL to excel my career, it\u2019s no career loss\nRide like a bicycle, smacked you up in high school\nLike an icicle I\u2019m ice cold\nFoursomes in Toronto, orgies in Montreal, pervert, aren\u2019t we all?\n\n[Hook]\n\n> > Lyrics posted by heroin4yourears < <"}], "artist": "Necro"}
