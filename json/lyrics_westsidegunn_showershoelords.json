Gotta sit for Christmas\nWifey on shit, that bitch missing visits\n'Cause we was stretching white like Richard Simmons\nCaught a case and the nigga pled the 5th amendment\nYeah, you know the whip be rented and bricks be in it, uh\nAnd I'ma get this chicken 'til my clique get sentenced\nI need a stash in the wall that whole 90 pies\nWord to me, I've been live since '95\nTook a trip to get the bag like 90 times\nYeah, you got it from your plug, but it's probably mines\nAll I needed was a trap spot, scale and a plate\nI ended up on a flat cot, cell upstate\nNow I really need a black Glock, shells and a tank\nYeah, the shit'll get uglier than Welven Da Great\nD's kicked in the door and snatched the four pound\nMy man paid ten stacks just to blow trial\nNow he callin' home, tellin' the crew to slow down\nI'd be rich if I knew then what I know now, uh\nLivin with regrets and I'm still willing to bear it\nPlus the shoe fits and I'm still willing to wear it\nIt's hard being a family man with interference\nAll the women and them trips to prison ended my marriage\nI grew up with the few damn crooks that baked work up\nWho used to have food stamp books and case workers\nMe? I'm way further from a place you ain't heard of\nWhere you get rich, die trying and face murder\nWhere your best friends start to switch when the case surface\nWhere it's hard to trust a man who ain't nervous\nI fell asleep with a 50 grand in a locked apartment\nThat night, I had a dream like Dr. Martin, woo, yeah\n\n[Scratches]\n\"I hear it in my sleep sometimes...\"\n\"See I can see the sound of my glow...\"\n\"Make them say that I'm God...\"\n\"Rhyme nice...\" [Flygod]\n\n[Interlude]\nBig money, big money\nBig money, big money\nHey, hey, hey, hey\nYou got big money, you got fancy cars\nEverybody knows you, it's like you're a trap star\nYou're breakin' down bricks, choppin' up O's\nBreakin' down bricks, choppin' up O's", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/152beb743989eb055c66dc25e0ebfade.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "FLYGOD", "title": "Shower Shoe Lords"}]}
