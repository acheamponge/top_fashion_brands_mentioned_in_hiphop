Man, I'd rather lick on a scrotum\nAnd eat the fuckin' Octomom's pussy lips with some okra\nWhile I watch Whoopi Goldberg scissor with Oprah\nWhile Rosie pussy-farts and takes a piss on the sofa\nGet a boner and play dick swords with the Jonas Brothers\nYour motherfuckin' mother's aroma's like no other\nI keep thinkin' of her smothered in somas\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nIt's chemical warfare, drop bombs like Saddam\nI'm bringing the drama, like Barack Obama\nPlaying Rock Em' Sock Em' robots with the Octomama\nI'm vato loco, homie I'll cock those llamas\nFor chemical warfare\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\nDid I just say Octomom twice in the same rap?\nFucking wack\nChemical warfare\nChemical warfare", "title": "Chemical Warfare", "album": "Chemical Warfare"}], "artist": "The Alchemist"}
