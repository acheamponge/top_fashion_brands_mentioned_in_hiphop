Whether it is gang banging\u201a whether it is trapping down south, whether it is hip hop, whatever it is. Like you know, if a motherfucker see it as an asset or as  resource, we don\u2019t got no means to\u2026", "image": "https://images.genius.com/40a53fdc7539c698dc14d0c556f79bf0.500x494x1.png", "year": "2019-04-13"}]}
