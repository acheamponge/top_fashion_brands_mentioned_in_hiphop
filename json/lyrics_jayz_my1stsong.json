This is my second major breakup\nMy first was with a pager\nWith a hooptie, a cookpot and the GAME\nThis one's with the stu', with the stage, with the fortune\nMaybe not the fortune, but certainly the FAME\n\n[Chorus: Jay-Z]\nIt's my life, it's my pain and my struggle\nThe songs that I sing to you is my everything\nTreat my first like my last, and my last like my first\nAnd my thirst is the same as when I came\nIt's my joy and my tears\nAnd the laughter it brings to me, it's my everything\nTreat my first like my last, and my last like my first\nAnd my thirst like the first song I sang\n\n[Outro: Jay-Z]\nWoo, it's like the blues, we gon' ride out on this one\nTy-Ty, B-High\nYo High, remember you was making them baskets\nFor them niggas at radio and shit?\nClark Kent, that was good looking out, nigga\nCarline, who ever thought we'd make it this far, homie?\nSha, they can't stop us, knahmsayin'?\nLenny S\nDame, whattup!
