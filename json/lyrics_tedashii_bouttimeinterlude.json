WE would go out on dates, we would share our deepest secrets. We were so, so close - he was my best friend.\"\n\n\"And so now, with the way that things turned out, I mean, how does that make you feel?\"\n\n\"Well, first I felt used, and sad. I felt deceived and lied to. In my head I pictured him as being my husband one day, and now that picture is just shattered. I just feel so alone.\""}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
