You see I write with my right hand\nRight now, write down, rights of a righthand man\nWho was left on a left-hand path\nSo I\u2019m Plath with the deadpan that\nMeans I\u2019m Colossus in my head\nDoing aerials I\u2019m Ariel & falling to my death\nStomping over cities that their god must have neglected\nInstead left an admonishment of long live the flesh\nDeath to the Videodrome & that\u2019s an order not request\nSo conform or get the wreck, uh\nA Klonipin & a cardiac arrest\nLeft an overworked artifact, a heart attack is next, uh\nSo I don\u2019t lollygag my steps\nThere\u2019s no tardy pass in hell, there\u2019s no sorry that can fix\nFrom over-sleeper to insomniac & stressed\nI\u2019m a somnambulist walking right into the hands of them", "album": "Salo Sessions"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
