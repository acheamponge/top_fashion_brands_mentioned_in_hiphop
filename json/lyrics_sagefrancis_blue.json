R.O.T.C.\"\nI don't think he can handle, he goes from flannel to camo\nCold putting all the ammo in his gun\nHe watched channel one, switched to channel two\nUnplug completely, the hottest part of a flame is blue\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe're acting like an enemy is the sea, sky, and land now\nCame across soldiers who did nothing but yell, \"stand down\"\nIn their spare time inside a shower stall\nIf not that, they're at the corner store playing PowerBall\nAnd when the towers fall, they get protective of this land\nAnd won't stand for anything to get resurrected\nThey're waiting for the second coming, the Great Pumpkin\nDeep down, they know they really wanna do is break something\nThat's what they're trained to do\nAnd then they say to you\n\"Just cause you see the devil in my eyes don't make it true\"\nAnd I say, \"true enough\"\nAll that fire in your eyes shows pain\nBut the flame ain't blue enough\n\n[Hook]", "album": "Sick to D(eat)h"}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
