I remember 88 with the backspin\nBack when it was more to hip-hop then rappin'\nBack when everybody spit it with a passion\nTime, time, time, time for some action\nBack when Iron Mike Tyson was the one to be\nMarley Marl and Pete Rock had hottest beats\nQueen Latifah had the video for human teeth\nAround the time that crack fucked up the community\nIt was the golden age era for rap\nNothing like now-a-days with all these terrible cats\nListening to Kane and to Kool G, it's a wrap\nEverytime you bought an album you just knew it was fat\nWay back, before I had the Sony walkman with playback\nBefore I had the A deck, Hydro and a hayracks\nBefore the invention of DVD's\nAnd KRS put it down for the BDP\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Termanology]\n\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nEating Skittles and digging in the fridge again\nBack when the doc said that Term needed some Idelin\nOn a mission and trying to get them dividends\nBack when I spit for anybody that was listenin'\nRemember pitchin' and a dollar for a nickle and\nIn 95 Mobb Deep had The Infamous\nAs a young kid, it was a bad influence\nI had the police trying to take my fingerprints\nCash rules everything around me - CREAM get the money\n4-5-6 give me that 20\nThat was the hot shit gettin' funds playin' dice\nSpending our studio time and adding ice\nSo I can relate to The Roots man they said it right\nHip-hop your the love of my life, like\n\n[Outro]\n\n\"Gangstarr\"\n[T]Is real hip-hop and uh\n\"KRS-One\"\n[T]That's real hip-hop and uh\n\"Rakim\"\n[T]Is real hip-hop and uh\n\"Public Enemy\"\n[T]That's real hip-hop and uh\n\"Kool G Rap and Polo\"\n[T]That's real hip-hop and uh\n\"A Tribe Called Quest\"\n[T]That's real hip-hop and uh\n\"Big Daddy Kane\" [T]That's real hip-hop and uh\n\"Ed O.G.\"\n[T]That's real\n[T]Hip-hop - x8"}], "artist": "Termanology"}
