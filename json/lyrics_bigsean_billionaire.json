Do you hear the applaudin'?\nCamera recording? Roll out the carpet\nBack in the spotlight, parallel parkin'\nAnd I do not have time for the jargon\nI hop on records, tend to break records\nG.O.O.D. Music what you think I'm signed to the best for?\nI mean I ain't really trying to trip\nBut what you mean \"show'em Jay\" you can't tell me shit\n\n[Hook]\nSo umm, Let my money stack\nTo a hundred stacks\nTimes a hundred stacks\nTimes a hundred that\nYeah, times a hundred that\nYeah, times a hundred that\nKeep it coming, coming, keep it coming\nKeep it coming, coming, keep it coming\nYeah, and times a hundred that\nSee I'm just trying to let me money stack\nTo hundred stacks, times a hundred stacks\nTimes a hundred that\n\n[Verse 2: Big Sean]\nBeast\nGot his bread up without yeast\nMan the least I could do is not lease\nSo I paid of a bill\nImagine how I feel\nSay my graces to the bank because I'm working on the mill\nThe hotels I check in with hoes I will check out\nAnd I'mma get to sexing until a nigga sexed out\n\n[Hook]\nSo let my money stack\nTo a hundred stacks\nTimes a hundred stacks\nTimes a hundred that\n\n[Verse 3: Big Sean]\nBape shit? Got it\nBBC? Got it\nPastel? Got it\nBefore he even dropped it\nFour chains on\nYeah I be on that Paul shit\nJesus piece too; add twenty thousand\nYou do not got this\nYou cannot afford it\nYou cannot stop it\nMight as well support it\n\n[Hook]\nLet my money stack\nTo a hundred stacks\nTimes a hundred stacks\nTimes a hundred that\nYeah, times a hundred that\nYeah, times a hundred that\nKeep it coming, coming, keep it coming\nKeep it coming, coming, keep it coming\nYeah, and times a hundred that\nSee I'm just trying to let me money stack\nTo a hundred stacks\nTimes a hundred stacks\nTimes a hundred that\nYeah, times a hundred that\nYeah, times a hundred that\nKeep it coming, coming, keep it coming\nKeep it coming, coming, keep it coming\nJust trying to let me money stack\nTo a hundred stacks\nCause I'm FF"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
