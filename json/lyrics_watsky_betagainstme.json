I was, ah, in my late teens\u2014I fell asleep waiting for the missile to fall dead center on my apartment, crash through the ceiling, and that was gonna be the end of everything. And I was amazed when I woke up the next morning and I was still alive\u2026\n\n[Chant (x2)]\nIf you want to lose your home (Bet against me)\nAnd every penny you own (Bet against me)\nYou want to eat your words (Bet against me)\nYou want your feelings hurt (Bet against me)\nYou want your ego bruised (Bet against me)\nIf you like to lose (Bet against me)\nIf you love regret (Bet against me)\nYou want to die in debt (Bet against me)\nIf you want to shed tears (Bet against me)\nYou want to lose ten years (Bet against me)\nIf you got too much wealth (Bet against me)\nIf you fuckin hate yourself (Bet against me)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0199ac49c667975a2b0c5188cae549aa.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "All You Can Do", "title": "Bet Against Me"}]}
