Dick figures!\nYou just watched a whole fucking movie of\u2026\nDick figures! Dick figures!\nBow before them and renounce your previous god\nDick figures! Dick figures!\nSomeone get a doctor 'cause this movie's fucking totally sick\nYou asked and they delivered\nIf you don't like Dick Figures\nIt's not hard to figure out you're a dick\n\n[Verse 2]\nI counted ten fucking explosions\nAnd jetpack demon ninjas that rocked your face\nYour life was a hot pile of garbage\nNow you're so excited that you're nutting all over the place\nOne of those explosions was an octopus\nSorry for the spoiler but it's your fault\nThat'll teach you to listen to the soundtrack\nBefore you watch the movie\n(I mean, for Godsake, who does that you stupid piece of\u2026)\n\n[Chorus]\nDick figures! Dick figures!\nThey saved the world what do you think about that?\nDick figures! Dick figures!\nYou just watched them you're so lazy and fat\nDick figures! Dick figures!\nYou love them with all of your stupid heart and also part of your chode\nYou asked and they delivered\nOur movies too great it made your junk explode\n\n[Bridge]\nOops our bad\nSorry about your junk\nJust kidding\nFuck you!\nDick figures!"}], "artist": "Ninja Sex Party"}
