the fucking problem is\nKnowledge got the information, debate with Sigmas and Kappas\nDecapitate the cadence, case closed [?]\nShake foes and I box 'em in in\nYou guys are monotonous\nI try to be positive, my mind is a monster bitch\nDemonstrative and negative taking ominous toxins\nI'm tired of talking, I'm tossing my temperament\nOff of tariff while tearing beats to bits and pieces\nProceeded to a sovereignty state of mind [?]\nFragile but yet he's magnifique, manually motivated\nI'm reeking of fecal matter, grab some baby wipes and pampers\nBoy that means I'm the shit\nGot a urethra full of Ether, poisonous when I piss\nAnd I'm accurate, I never miss\nI dismiss 'em quick when I'm torching it\nCorrelate with a few from a destitutional view\nAnd what I do is dominate like my name Ndamukong Suh\nI pursue, consumin' the coon that was cool with kickin' some ignorance\nCut the head off of a thief that was stealin' in front of witnesses\nLeave 'em in disbelief as I mutilate you [with grief]\nIf I cease in seizin' the moment, I'm sure attention will leave\nAnd intent is to see me falling' in autumn on top of leaves\nI mean jeez, just let me breathe\nThey criticizing my creation\nCase the joint like I'm [?] before the conversion\nMerging and swerving in traffic, this man is attacking\nThe flow is a trap and fuck all the tactics\nDisintegrate your distractions\nIn fact I'm quick to react so you have to pardon my [?]\nWith these rapid fire raps that you couldn't wrap your mind around\nI got a solitary [?] but I'm the sickest, I'm profound\nFor what I found is that I'm bound\nI'll elevate, I'll never drown\nI'm livin' high until I die, I'm in the sky, my nigga whaaatt?!\nBringing the rhythm, I swear that I do\n[?] (no, no)\nTellin' you once and I say that I'm nice\nI bet that I'm ready to (go, go)\nGive me your life and then give me your money\nI said that I'll take it in front of your face\nI'm runnin' around in a race\nWho keeping the pace?\nYou niggas are lookin' disgraced\nI bet that I'm takin' your place\nSo why you givin' me all of the hate?\nCome back like MJ but that's minus the 45\nLevitatin' over water like Christ or Marty McFly\n\nI, feel like I'm barely alive, alive, alive\nI, feel like I'm barely alive, alive, alive\nI, feel like I'm barely alive, alive, alive\nI prefer to tell the truth instead of living a lie\nI said I, feel like I'm barely alive, alive, alive\nI, feel like I'm barely alive, alive, alive\nI, feel like I'm barely alive, alive, alive\nI prefer to tell the truth instead of living a lie\n\nNow if you feel a young nigga, let me rock one time\nIf you feel a young nigga, let me rock one time\nIf you feel a young nigga, let me rock one time\nDon't forget your teflon for this lyrical homicide\nIf you feel a young nigga, let me rock one time\nIf you feel a young nigga, let me rock one time\nIf you feel a young nigga, let me rock one time\nDon't forget your teflon for this lyrical homicide, nigga lawd\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nDopest nigga breathing, I just hope that you'll remember me\nI'm like Buffalo Bill, I'll wear your skin like it's a cardigan\nAssess the scene, abducting you, you start the screaming, panic\nShut your motherfucking mouth and put the lotion in the basket bitch!\nIf you don't put the lotion on your motherfucking skin\nI guess that you finna get the hose again and\nI'm opposing life, it's like a poltergeist and\nI'm a poster child with postpartum depression\nK double A to the goddamn N\nWhen I spit it's like a K with an A\nIn the front of the 47 behind the bodies in the trunk and\nThe cop light flash but I hit the gas\nMy nigga fuck that shit I ain't going to jail\nBut when I'm put inside a cell, then it's in restraints\nSo then I hook a left but then I book a right\nI think I'm lost oh no, but that's hindsight\nMy mind ain't right I'm manic-depressive\nTried to kill myself but that was excessive\nI guess that it came from internal aggression\nI can't get a therapist, oh so expensive\nIf I told a story it would be extensive\nI pray to the lord and I call it repenting\nIn terms of addictions I know I'm dependant on different drugs that I can do myself\nI'm all alone, a young silent soul\nI want to serenate , save and sanctified\nYou want to verify rhymes with no compliance\nBut I counteract it with the concentration\nAnd salute the F\u00fchrer with the firmer plan\nI want to purify, [?], and purge the land\nYou know gentrify, and try to clean it up\nAnd get the Riff-Raff the hell away from me\nJody Highroller in a fucking noose\nAnd I attach the rope to a sycamore\nAnd I'ma sic ya boy, I got no remorse\nI cut some more, they cussed galore\nAccustomed to, abusin' you\nYou black and blue, it's more than true\nSo warn your crew, no need for truce, I chuck the deuce\nThen grab a casket, pick a basket\nI'ma basketcase, can a nigga think?\nBetter understand I'ma the man and a beast\nI'm a crazy motherfucker that's comin' out of the verse\nWhen I murder you with the verb and that visualized pain\nBut it is what it is, and you know it, lawd\nI can't believe that you're really impressed\nAll of this bullshit I constantly hear\n'Cause you playin' a rapper that stole from somebody\nThat rapper they stole from had stole from somebody\nWe are all derivatives, I am aware if it\nNo originality, it's embarrassing\nWhen will they see this shit, nobody studies it\nHip Hop is Pop now-a-days and you loving it\nGuess that I'm [?], I roll with they [?]\nThe next time you see me, the scene will be seedy\nI seem to subdue while confusin' the greedy\nI really don't get it [?] again\nBut I'm usin' my pen as a means to an end\nAnd these niggas are talking, they say they the best\nBut nobody has yet to come close to Rakim\nSo [?] there is room for the growth\nWe should focus on that and stop doing the most\n'Cause there isn't a title I'll work to attain\nI just wish that I wasn't alone and insane, fuck\n\n[Verse 3]\nI told them all there's no chance\nAnd I warned you all in advance\nI don't plan to scramble for answers\nMy temper's like Eric Bana\nStart panicking when I'm pissed\nPersistent as pistols that pop, I insist, I insert the clip\nI cock it and call you a prick while I'm picking off plenty victims\nThey playing possum, I spot 'em\nOne shot, I gotta reload it\nThe street is coated with blood\nI'm an animal anticipatin', patience paying off\nI'm pacing, praying, pardon me as people pass a pity party\nOkay boy, let's get it started\nTime to harvest all my hatred\nHasten statements, case in point as I depict with pens and pencils\nTaking power, tower over weaker races\nNot complacent when I'm writin'\nBite my tongue, I never do it\nGot a purpose, I pursue it\nI'm the truth, I thought you knew it\nOh well, show my skill\nFeel this field is filled with fakes\nIt's fuck 'em all, can't trust no snakes\nI navigate, elaborate, this labyrinth, a masterplan\nPastors came for donations\nAnd passin' collection plates for his Monte Carlo [?]\nThe congregation debased\nThey see praising God as escape from dilemmas and tribulations\nAttributing to the pockets of Pontius Pilates and demons that profit from all they problems\nI promise that a nigga gon' switch it\nI'm on it when I murder every witness\nI [?] never tell 'em my business\nI [?] with the way that I [?]\nYou talkin' but you never really lived it\nRead a random chapter from the bible, screaming Hallelujah\nAskin' God if he exist and if he do it's nice to know him\nI just want my sanity and happiness, no Isotoners\nI'm a loner, constant struggle, my depression will consume me\nSoon to be a [?]\nFor the fact I fucking snapped and slapped a [?] for talking back\nAttackin', take the heart from them\nThey lack the arsenal to win\nAn arsonist with narcissistic tendencies and temperament\nCould take your soul and terrify it\nI defy with all my rhymes, and they align like constellations\nThe Milky Way's mighty spacious, Orion's Belt is my spaceship\nI follow the drink and [?] it, and quench my thirst and my hunger\nI'm longing for something more so can some one send me a sign\n'Cause I'm really having a difficult issue dealing with time\nIn addition to the attrition afflicting me in my mind, fuck\nI can't breathe nor think right now\nBut I'm making the most of the time that I get\nIf I live like I did when I cut my wrist\nThen I just might trip and you don't want that\nI black out and do some things I don't remember usually\nI used to see the world as a beautiful organism\nBut that was in '96, I mean shit I was just a kid\nI've convinced myself that it's hopeless, I'm well aware that it is\nI can feel the Devil, he's screaming, he's coming right at my neck\nAs he offers diamonds and cheques\nAnd he tells me that they'll respect all the fucking art I create\nBut man I refuse to accept it, I'm not a vessel of hate\nI'm just venting upon these pages\nApparently people feel that my poetry is preposterous\nProbably pressing play and applauding when I am posthumous\nGeneration of followers, only fuck with the popular\nProblem is that this populous glorifies the demonstrative\nDominate, I'm a deputy\nDestitute with a debutante\nDestined to be indebted to [?] many credit cards\nE.B.T in amenities, [all for] Benjamin Franklins\nFrankly I'm a man of sin\nMedicated with medicine\nMescaline for your Majesty\nMaddeningly, 'cause I casually\nMurder beats in this magnifique\nManufactured for listeners\nBut nobody is listening\nStand my ground, I'm not giving in\nTop of the game and I bet that I reach it\nYou ain't fuckin' with me so why are you speaking?\nThis shit that I spit is ridiculous, yes\nI give a fuck if you're really impressed\nI'm on a level that you cannot see\nAnd I'm definitely someone you can not be, lawd"}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
