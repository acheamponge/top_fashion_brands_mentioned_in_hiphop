This is a demo dedicated to everyone that whooped my ass. I didn't even know how to reload my weapon, they wouldn't tell me\n\n\nYo, one piece of bread plus one piece of bread\nPlus two little packages of peanut butter spread\nEquals dinner, we gotta share it\nLet me spoil you for being such a great parent\nI just paid the mortgage and paid for the gas\nAnd our son's medical expenses in full with cash\nHopefully they'll turn the power back on but if they don't\nWe can't do a thing about it babe, cause we too broke\nSee, you hoped as a young Irish lass\nThat you'd meet a slick gentleman with style and class\nWith the world on a string and a powerful mouth\nTill you moved in with me and the power is out\nAnd what I have to offer you ain't the least bit nifty\nA peanut butter sandwich you gotta split with me\nSo, light a candle and flavor up the night\nIt's a special occasion, baby, savor every bite\n\nChorus\nMatter of fact Imma love you like that\nCause you're so beautiful on the inside\nMatter of fact Imma love you like that\nCause you're so beautiful on the inside\nMatter of fact Imma love you like that\nCause you're so beautiful on the inside\nMatter of fact Imma love you like that\nCause you're so beautiful on the inside\n\nOne Irish man plus one Irish lady\nPlus a ten month old epileptic baby\nEquals a lot of tiny seizures in the same day\nElectric pulses feeding off his brain waves\nAnd there's a lot of little things I got the urge to do\nTake the wooden spoon from his mouth, stir the stew\nServe it to him and the blue lights in his head\nAnd we can settle for the two slices of bread\nIt's all we can afford, we don't gotta choice\nI just wanna watch you raise your little boy\nI swear to god babe if I get rich\nI'm gonna find a way to stop the damn seismic twitch\nIn his mind, the boy's been defined as special needs\nAnd Imma search till I find that devil's seed\nPlanted, tell them we can not afford much else\nBaby please just enjoy that sandwich\n\nMatter of fact Imma love you like that\nCause you're so beautiful on the inside\nMatter of fact Imma love you like that\nCause you're so beautiful on the inside\nMatter of fact Imma love you like that\nCause you're so beautiful on the inside\nMatter of fact Imma love you like that\nCause you're so beautiful on the inside\n\nOne neurologist plus one Mayo clinic\nPlus a scalp EEG every time we visit\nEquals you and me sittin here on the couch\nAnd I don't gotta dime to take you out\nI'm still so impressed with the way you act like it doesn't bother you\nMaybe I'm wrong though, maybe it doesn't\nCause I genuinely feel you wouldn't change him if you could\nYou'd carve him a halo out of wood\nCause electric current can pass through metal and shock those smiles\nWhen a charge is produced by a snot-nosed child\nSo harmless and cute, when sipping from his baby bottle too\nBut that's what I have to offer you\nWhat I have to offer you ain't the least bit nifty\nA life full of burdens you gotta split with me\nAn undertow of debt making me 360 (*Thanks Nic Swaner for correction*), but fuck it\nAs long as it's with you, I love it\n\nMatter of fact Imma love you like that\nCause you're so beautiful on the inside\nMatter of fact Imma love you like that\nCause you're so beautiful on the inside\nMatter of fact Imma love you like that\nCause you're so beautiful on the inside\nMatter of fact Imma love you like that\nCause you're so beautiful on the inside\nMatter of fact Imma love you like that\nCause you're so beautiful on the inside\nMatter of fact Imma love you like that\nCause you're so beautiful on the inside\nMatter of fact Imma love you like that\nCause you're so beautiful on the inside\nMatter of fact Imma love you like that\nCause you're so beautiful on the inside\n\nWe gotta get to thirty songs...", "year": "2009-10-13", "album": "The Love Potion Collection 5", "title": "Inside"}], "artist": "Mac Lethal"}
