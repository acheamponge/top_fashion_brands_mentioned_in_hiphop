Like, this has been man's dream. And, like, in a way I'm grateful I never got there bringing it, \u2019cause like, it made man so hungry fam. Like, man has been hungry fam. And you know what it is, that's what sparks the fire, the hunger fam. I swear to God, I wake up fucking hungry every day.\"\n\"But man thinks I'm joking. You see all this, 'man's tour bus rah, rah, rah'? I been sitting on a tour bus, like fam, I need my old ones, so man can both beef in the scene. And everyone, you can bring more mandem, and everyone else, 'cause man needs this.\"\n\"Oh shit, man's passionate. Man has gone from man\u2019s phone being cut off. I\u2019m talking 'bout broke, man\u2019s gone from sharing wings to sharing bottles. Like sharing wings, 50p, a pound for three wings or four wings.\"\n\"Like, 'give me one brudda'.\"\n\"That's four wings each. That was it! Man\u2019s gone from being flat broke\u2014when I say broke, I mean broke, man's mum's have been broke. Like, light's gone, electric's gone, we gotta try go through the morning and get Ps, the key's on emergency. Man's gone from dat to Mercedes-Benz keys. It's changed B! Life has just changed. Man's had the same drive, man's had the talent.\"\n\"But yeah, man was there fam, like literally. Like south students and Southern Hospitality. We was there spitting bars, like spitting bars. We had bars, we had tapes, on tapes, on tapes. I don't even know where the tapes have gone. You was doing this ting fam. Shutting down our ends, you were shutting it.\""}]}
