Don't give a fuck!)\nStill talking shit, still kickin\u2019 up dust!\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt\u2019s a shame when I gotta check a dame six ways from Sunday\nRest on the seventh murder on Monday\nYou wanna reminisce? You really don\u2019t know me\nI\u2019m as real as it gets, so who\u2019s really the phony?\nLearned to scream and became a queen\nBut I can still rock a rhyme that\u2019s mean\nSo don't step with that lightweight crap\nI'm \u201cBlack Flag\u201d to your \u201cAdam Ant\u201d\nI kill ants on contact, when I rap\nAnd If you don't get the reference, its cause ya can't\nYou're like Carly squawkin' that \"Call Me Maybe\"\nI'm like Teena talkin' \u201cSquare Biz\u201d baby\nBut I'mma rip ya and hip ya to the \"B\"\nThe T-A-I-R-R-I-E\nAnd If I'm too wordy it's cause I kick game\nMay the bridges I burn light my motherfuckin\u2019 name!\n\n[Chorus](x2)\nA fly girl's a girl who speaks their mind\nHardcore, back with a brand new sick rhyme\nWhat's the time? Don't give a fuck!\nStill talking shit, still kickin\u2019 up dust!\n\n[Bridge]\nNow throw your hands up and check my flow\nAs above, so below\nI said throw your hands up and check my flow\nCheck my flow\n(Turn up the microphone)\n\n[Verse 3]\nA hymn for the haters, some old school gospel\nI don\u2019t hustle, I'm known to get hostile\nSo violent with a mic in my hand\nYou better run for cover if I get my band\nAll my fans and blasphemous girls\nGot witches in my coven all around the world\nDressed in black ready to attack\nA wolf pack that got my back and it's like that\nBy the pricking of my thumbs\nSomething wicked this way comes\nI get wicked and then some collecting teeth\nBetter watch your mouth next time we meet\nWolves don't lose sleep from opinions of sheep\nAnd night is falling, the moon is shining\nClouds are forming, the storm is coming\nThis is a warning\n\n[Chorus](x2)\nA fly girl's a girl who speaks their mind\nHardcore, back with a brand new sick rhyme\nWhat's the time? Don't give a fuck!\nStill talking shit, still kickin\u2019 up dust!\n\n[Outro]\nHallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah!"}], "artist": "Tairrie B"}
