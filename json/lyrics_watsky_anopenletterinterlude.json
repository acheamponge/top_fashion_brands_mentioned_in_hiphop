You wouldn't know what I'm doin'\nYou're always goin' berserk, but you never show up to work\nGive my regards to Abigail\nNext time you write about my lack of moral compass\nAt least I do my job up in this rumpus! (OH!)\nThe line is behind me, I crossed it again\nOoh, the president lost it again\nAw, such a rough life\nBetter run to your wife, \"Yo, the boss is in Boston again\"\nLet me ask you a question: who sits...\nAt your desk when you're in Massachusetts?\nThey were calling you a dick back in '76\nAnd you really haven't done anything new since\nYou're a nuisance with no sense\nYou would die of irrelevance\nGo ahead, you aspire to my level, you aspire to malevolence\nSay hi to the Jeffersons!\nAnd the spies all around me, maybe they can confirm\nI don't care if I kill my career with this letter\nI'm confining you to one term\nSit down, John, you fat motherfucker!\n\n[Outro]\nDo do-do-DO do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do\nCool", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7ddd36cfe52ebd587314cd5a5962dacb.1000x886x1.jpg", "album": "The Hamilton Mixtape", "title": "An Open Letter (Interlude)"}]}
