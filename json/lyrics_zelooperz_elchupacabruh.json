I'm stalling, to put a hole in your flow\nOut of line then they all see, back to the dark scene\nThe gremlins is sparking, I feel be-longings\nThe streets is haunted, seen thoughts, she authorized me\nTo paint a vivid scenery, spooky as she wanted me\n\"Go to sleep girl,\" she boo-hooing on my shoulder, she all on me\nShe know what it is, I treat and I heat greenery\n\n[Hook]\nEl Chupacabruh, where did you find him?\nSmokin' that fungus and plenty is hotter\nThis ain't the type that you see all the time\nKilling niggas ain't a regular life\nEl Chupacabruh, where did you find him?\nSmokin' that fungus and plenty is hotter\nThis ain't the type that you see all the time\nKilling niggas ain't a regular life\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow if you can't understand, you ain't resharded, bitch you stupid\nYou suck like pretty nipples and juicy coochies\nLoopz I come back around seconds, seconds, Y'all the buffet\nAin't for the play play, slaying cats like chinks\nBorn to win? Fuck you mean? Scorn the ops they all t'd\nTops they all can do is hate on me\nBlatantly make a disarray on faces they can't see\nToo low key, Matrix, Matrix, Keanu Reeves\nDim the lights, she drunken like a monkey\nFuck with me cause I keep it funky\n\n[Hook]\nEl Chupacabruh, where did you find him?\nSmokin' that fungus and plenty is hotter\nThis ain't the type that you see all the time\nKilling niggas ain't a regular life\nEl Chupacabruh, where did you find him?\nSmokin' that fungus and plenty is hotter\nThis ain't the type that you see all the time\nKilling niggas ain't a regular life"}]}
