Petey Pab' motherfucker!\nFirst to put it down for North Carolina\nBut guess what (what?), it's been worth it\nI'm a superstar, bought me a big ol' car\nFour point six (see the car!)\nBlack with the bars from the front to back\nAnd got a button in the middle, make the trunk go \"eh-eh\"\nBut it ain't 'bout that\nIt's about getting what you getting and driving all back here\nBig fellas (six fellas)\nHalf of me and Carolina niggas done time together\nPolk, Bladen, Marshall, Hoke, Greene County, Tillery, damn\nTransfer, Sandy Ridge, Browns over here (greens over here)\nPasqoutank, down on the, Odom East (let me think)\nJohnson County, Franklin, Burgaw, Newport, Warren, Shelby, Kenansville\n(Man Currituck) Tarboro, Triangle, Goldsboro, Halifax, Statesville\nAnd all my niggas doing life behind the wall\nThis right here, right here, right here's for\n\n[Hook]\nThis one's for North Carolina!

My house, my home, my hood (hah!)\nMy brother, my sister, my cous' (hah!)\nMy niggas that was there from the beginning\nBeen wit me even 'fore they knew what bein' with me was\nY'all niggas just glanced at it, now I got y'all staring at it\nBut it's been the same ol' North Carolina it's been being\nY'all niggas just getting it, oh it's a shame isn't it?\nOh you thought we said we were coming wit a whole lotta something\nWe were bullshhh! (ahh!)\n\n[Hook]\nThis one's for North Carolina! Come on and raise up\nTake your shirt off, twist it 'round your hand\nSpin it like a helicopter\nNorth Carolina!

Us, us, us, yes sir!\n\n[Verse 3]\nMan I had to do it\nJust in case you were one of the ones\nWho wanted to come and ask something stupid\n(What you think you doin'?) What it look like?\nPutting it down for my niggas in the south side\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina\nAnd all my little bitty overlooked hick towns\nWe gonna hit y'all asses, ain't nothing but a T. T. blast\nWhat we got coming at you?\n(Beats?) slamming, (verses?) classic\n(Gold for this) What's after platinum?\n(Baby you don't want the bomb)\nAnd I don't meant to scare ya\nBut I'm about to bring it home\nBlow these valleys, these hills, these streams\nAnd N. C. outta the water\nHow's it feel to look a motherfucker dead in the grill\nAnd tell 'em, \"I told ya!\"\n\n[Hook]\nThis one's for North Carolina!
