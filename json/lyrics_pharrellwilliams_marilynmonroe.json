We're helpless romantics\nWe can not help who we're attracted to\nSo let's all dance, and elevate each other\n\n[Hook: Pharrell Williams]\nDear diary, it's happenin' again\nThis energy, like I'm 'bout to win\nI just close my eyes and visions appear\nShe's everything I want, and it's crystal clear\nNot even Marilyn Monroe\nWho? Cleopatra? Please\nNot even Joan of Arc\nThat don't mean nothin' to me\nI just want a different girl\nGirl, girl, girl, girl\nGirl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough\n\n[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]\nWhy, why do I have to lie?\nPretend, make believe or hide her?\nWhen I love what I've described\nBut then again, I don't need no adjectives for this girl\n\n[Hook: Pharrell Williams]\nDear diary, it's happenin' again\nThis energy, like I'm 'bout to win\nI just close my eyes and visions appear\nShe's everything I want, and it's crystal clear\nNot even Marilyn Monroe\nWho? Cleopatra? Please\nNot even Joan of Arc\nThat don't mean nothin' to me\nI just want a different girl\nGirl, girl, girl, girl\nGirl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough\nDear diary, it's happenin' again\nThis energy, like I'm 'bout to win\nI just close my eyes and visions appear\nShe's everything I want, and it's crystal clear\nNot even Marilyn Monroe\nWho? Cleopatra? Please\nNot even Joan of Arc\nThat don't mean nothin' to me\nI just want a different girl\nGirl, girl, girl, girl\nGirl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough\n\n[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]\nWhat's wrong with that?\nWhat's wrong with that? Yeah\nWhat's wrong with that?\n\n[Interlude: Kelly Osbourne]\nIn honor of the groove and all who's surrendered to it\nWe say thank you, and we take it back\n\n[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]\nWished so hard, I wished so hard that it came true\nThen my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon\nI put my arms around her, and I promise not to abuse you\nSince now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you?\n\n[Hook: Pharrell Williams]\nDear diary, it's happenin' again\nThis energy, like I'm 'bout to win\nI just close my eyes and visions appear\nShe's everything I want, and it's crystal clear\nNot even Marilyn Monroe\nWho? Cleopatra? Please\nNot even Joan of Arc\nThat don't mean nothin' to me\nI just want a different girl\nGirl, girl, girl, girl\nGirl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough\nDear diary, it's happenin' again\nThis energy, like I'm 'bout to win\nI just close my eyes and visions appear\nShe's everything I want, and it's crystal clear\nNot even Marilyn Monroe\nWho?
