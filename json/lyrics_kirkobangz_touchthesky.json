I'm the truth\nGot feelings I don't express\nUntil I'm live in the booth\nNobody really cares about the shit I'm going through\nUntil I make a song about it\nThen you're going through it too\nYou see they bring hate to you\nRap critics debating you\nUntil you hit home on some shit that they relating to\nThen they're like \"Damn man, that ni--a go hard b\"\nBut last week you said that you was soft, going R&B\nWe live in a selfish world\nBroke ni--as, wealthy girls\nNi--as turn sensitive\nI blame it on that twitter shit\nNi--as supposed to be less talk more action\nInstead of sitting on yo ass\nAnd thinkin' 'bout the status\nWhat happened to the soldiers?\nThe soul of the front line\nCaptain Kirk up in the sky\nMan, you know I got mine\n\n[Hook]\nI hold my head up just enough to see the skies\nAnd when we go we won't go slow we'll put up such a fight\nAnd you will be one day exactly what you are\nJust keep your head held high\nKiss your fist and touch the sky\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'll never slow down\nI'm a come and go ni--a\nThey won't appreciate you\nTill you dead and gone ni--a\nI gotta reinvent myself\nAt times I prevent myself\nFrom shinin' too hard on you ni--as\nGotta tint myself\nI think about the life I live\nAnd where a ni--a goin' to\nYoung Brett Farve\nBut I know who the fuck I'm throwin' to\nYou're chillin' in your 4-2\nPlay action force you to blitz\nMan I'm goin deep, all in yo bitch\nNi--as cheap money talks\nSpeak up, I don't read lips\nGot a list of people I don't fuck with\nLeave 'em pissed, tryna block my shine\nPuff Daddy in the eclipse\nSteven Spielberg with the words I don't need scripts\nYou better stop 'em before he turn into a problem\nBeing real and this young is abnormal\nWith that being said, shit I'd probably be dead before I get to the top\nEither way I touch the sky, ni--a\n\n[Hook]\nI hold my head up just enough to see the skies\nAnd when we go we won't go slow we'll put up such a fight\nAnd you will be one day exactly what you are\nJust keep your head held high\nKiss your fist and touch the sky"}]}
