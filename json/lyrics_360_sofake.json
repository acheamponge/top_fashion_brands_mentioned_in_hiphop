(why not?)\nYou're so fake (huh) you're so fake (listen)\nYou're so fake, you're never gonna be yourself\n\n[Verse 2]\nHonestly, fuck taking my time\nYo, I'm after the spotlight and I'm making it mine\nAnd I had the haters claim that I was faking my rhymes\nBut I've left that shit behind, fuck saying goodbye\nBecause I love hip-hop but I hate the Australian type\nA bunch of meatheads acting all crazy in fight\nYo, I'm brave enough to say what I say on the mic\nOn some real shit, I'm staying that way till I die\nOptimistic and I place all the hate to the side\nHate these days, always patiently waiting inline\nI know I shine but it's making me blind\nThere's heaps of beats to destroy and paper to find\nYou're all caught in an image ashamed when you cry\nI'd rather cry then have my face imitate a disguise\nIt's like I'm always being faced with these lines\nIt ain't my life but you say that it's mine\nI used to take it in stride, wish I talk with Australian pride\nBut I hate this country, I hate what you like\nSuperficial, highstrung, protencious and fake\nThe fucked thing is ninety percent will never relate\n\n[Outro]\nUh, yeah, have a think about that one\nIf you think it's about you then it probably is\nThat one was meant to be taken to heart\nYeah, 360, Pabstrakt, what?"}]}
