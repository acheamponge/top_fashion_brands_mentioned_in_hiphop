Dummy, this is one-way\nYo, that\u2019s your man?  Hmm, I think he\u2019s gay\nYou thought you was tough like them guys who robbed you\nFronting like you sell drugs, you know you got a job, duke\nAlways ice-grilling, fucking up the barbeque, fronting\nWith your boys like, \u201cThat\u2019s the murder-drama crew.\u201d  It\u2019s chumps\nLike you that give us a bad name, telling my\nLife\u2019s story in your weak/week rap game.  I know\nYou was watching me.  I used to see you peep.  You was\nSo interested.  Why you ain\u2019t never sleep?  It\u2019s deep\nIt goes back to childhood in the streets.  You was\nLying \u2018bout pussy, beating your meat.  Imagi-\n-nary friends, things you did, places you be.  Basic-\n-ally, you the same thing that gave birth to me (Pussy, pussy)\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz and (Jean Grae)]\nYou ain\u2019t\nA thug.

You\nThugs is killing me.  I only fear God.  You think you\nLook tough?  In my eyes, you got on leotards.  Keep\nPlaying the role, yeah, get your head bent \u2018cause you\nSo pussy, you could get pregnant.  It\u2019s\nSad.  You act like your gun blast math, but you the\nSame one that used to get hurt for your bus pass.  It ain\u2019t\n2Pac, four.  Y\u2019all just followers.  Thanks to\nJa Rule, we got a whole bunch of \"Hollarers,\" dollar-\n-borrowers, gold chain gossipers, Acade-\n-my Award killers who deserve Oscars.  Y\u2019all ain\u2019t\n\u2018Bout it, but since your fronting got no limit, I see the\nFuture\u2014wait, you about to die in a minute\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz and (Jean Grae)]\nYou ain\u2019t\nA thug.

You wasn\u2019t\nBroke and hungry\u2014that ain\u2019t why you started selling crack.  You\u2019re a\nClown.  You wanted to be down to sound gritty\nYour life was inspired by New Jack City, King of New\nYork, Mobb Deep, DMX, and Biggie\nI\u2019m tired of you cowards.  I\u2019ll fuck you up!  Menti-\n-roso.  You know, in jail, you was butt.  You wasn\u2019t\nManito.  Uribe then stuck you up.  Real\nVolcanoes don\u2019t smoke\u2014they just erupt.  No\nPhone calls for you.  They would have cut you, plus you\nSuck.  No, really.  You suck\nBulletproof vest, man?  You need D-cups\nAnd just like this song, you\u2019re funny, son.  Woke up\nIn your cell, laying next to Snickers and honeybuns.  You just\nWanted attention like a live Giga Pet, so to\nLook the look, you started smoking cigarettes.  You never\nUsed to puff weed, true indeed, \u2018til you heard Boot\nCamp.  Now it\u2019s like, \u201cYo, what up with the trees?\u201d  They\u2019re in a\nForest\u2014same place your corpse gon\u2019 be \u2018cause\nFantasy never brings L-O-V-E\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz and (Jean Grae)]\nYou ain\u2019t\nA thug.  (You just acting bugged) \u2018cause you\nWant a hug from shorty, (but she don\u2019t got love).  And when you\nGot slugged, she said, (\u201cIt must be drugs.  That ain\u2019t my)\n(Man.  Why\u2019d you fuck him up?\u201d)\n(You just acting bugged)\n(But she don\u2019t got love)\n(\u201cIt must be drugs.  That ain\u2019t my)\n(Man\u201d)\n\n[Outro: Jean Grae]\nCome on, man.  You ain\u2019t no goddamn thugs.  \u201cBut she not in the streets.\u201d  Why everybody gotta be from the streets.  Y\u2019all playing from the sidewalks, y\u2019all living in the streets where the cars at.  Come off this, please.  Haaa.  I be sighing.  It\u2019s hot.  C-Rayz, I\u2019m out of here.  I want my money for this"}]}
