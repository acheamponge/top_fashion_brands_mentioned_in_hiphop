Life's second hand smoke!\n\n[Verse 1: Sage The Gemini]\nHuh, life's second hand smoke, thoughts of being a criminal\nFar from being a doctor, my opera is singing kill these fools\nAround here it's just me, buddy Ricky and Cameron\nMan, we ain't wanna hurt nobody, if anything scare them\nEleven, by the street code, outside of the screen doors\nWhere all the niggas sell pounds, next week riding in three lows\nCarrying two hundred, not dollars, thousands\nNo time for restrooms, use the side of the houses\nBring a pack to big homie, sit down, let's count it\nAw there, go by something for your housing\nDon't spend it up, live it up, somebody rob you, just give it up\nDon't be selfish, appoint your niggas\nFind something to split it up!\n\n[Hook: Eric Bellinger]\nAin't even got to smoke to get faded\nYou ain't gotta drink to say you made it\nOh na na, second hand smoke\nNo I don't want no second hand smoke!\nI ain't worried about you, I'm a do what I like\nMy niggas keep it real, we ain't living the life\nAin't fucking with that second hand smoke\nAin't no time for the second hand smoke\n\n[Verse 2: Sage The Gemini]\nYeah, yeah, life's a second hand smoke, thoughts of being a criminal\nMoney needs, I should find a few girls and start pimping them\nHow should I ask, when I do will they handle it\nNever mind, I go to jail like pimping and pondering, uh!\nAnd I can\u2019t do the pen unless it\u2019s record deals\nI made a hit at 18 and it\u2019s the record still\nFollow up, the real hits be bottled up!\nUsed to sneak soda in McDonald's cups\nAnd still never got enough, huh!\n\n[Hook: Eric Bellinger]\nAin't even got to smoke to get faded\nYou ain't gotta drink to say you made it\nOh na na, second hand smoke\nNo I don't want no second hand smoke!\nI ain't worried about you, I'm a do what I like\nMy niggas keep it real, we ain't living the life\nAin't thinking with the second hand smoke\nAin't no time for the second hand smoke\nAin't even got to smoke to get faded\nYou ain't gotta drink to say you made it\nOh na na, second hand smoke\nNo I don't want no second hand smoke!\nI ain't worried about you, I'm a do what I like\nMy niggas keep it real, we ain't living the life\nAin't thinking with the second hand smoke\nAin't no time for the second hand smoke\nNa na na", "album": "Remember Me (Deluxe Booklet Edition)"}], "artist": "Sage The Gemini"}
