See what these bitches looking like!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSee what these bitches looking like\nStick in all crooked like\nLouie V is my Kryptonite\nTake your bitch and I give her back\nGive her this and I give her that\nFine wine and lobster tail\nCandle light and Chrisette Michele\nLook at the pussy and play kiss and tell\nFix her hair then fix her nails\nEven pay a few bills\nWay I'm running shit man I should have a shoe deal\nAnd my whole crew ill\nPockets on Fatburger\nGoing so hard you'd think I mixed a Viagra with a Soda\nStaying focused, this yola here\nBlack and white ice: polar bear\nYou hold her hand and I hold her hair\nI pull her close and put it there\n\n[Hook]\nStarted off with a OZ\nEnd up riding fo' deep\nPull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me\nI said I pull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me\nStarted off with a OZ\nEnd up riding fo' deep\nStarted off with a OZ\nEnd up riding fo' deep\nPull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me\n\n[Outro: Tom Lehrer]\nWhen the shades of night are falling\nComes a fellow everyone knows\nIt's the old dope peddler spreading joy wherever he goes"}], "artist": "2 Chainz"}
