Ay ay, take one of these\nAy ay, drink some of this\nIs she ready? Ay ay, pop one of these\nAy ay, smoke some of this\n\n[Kia Shine]\nIs she ready? She ready to pop\nMy name Kia Shine and she want me to knock\nAight, aight; already\nShe ready to go and the gal just missed me\nDon't sweat me - just, let me breathe\nAhhh - in a second, we gon' leave\nI got some tricks rolled up my sleeve\nI got some {dick} you about to eat\nNow momma hop in this quarter tilt (tilt)\nDon't pop you another pill (chill)\nAnd make sure you drink yo' water (water)\nI'm 'bout to hurt somebody's daughter (daughter)\nShe said she feelin my swagger (my swagger)\nI said I'm feelin that ass (that ass)\nShe respect my fresh\nAnd in a minute she gon' respect my sex\nI told her!\n\n[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]\n\n[Kia Shine]\nKinfolk! Now this groupie chick was so deceptive\nActin like she ain't never heard my records\nKnowin damn well that her whole objective\nWas to find Kia Shine and try to sex him\nClub closed now she ready to go to breakfast\nAfter that she wanna get a suite at the Westin\nHopped in the whip so she could follow\nShe said she love girls and she love to swallow\nPromiscuous girl like Nelly Furtado\nLike a Shirley Murdoch, I'll be gone tomorrow\nOne night stand like a, comedi-an\nYou not my girl and me not your man\nI'm sayin, ain't no sense in tryin to pretend\nCheck out time, Kia Shine is in the wind\nAll good things must come to an end\nBut if I catch yo' ass again babygirl bring a friend\nAIGHT~!\n\n[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]\n\n[Jack Frost]\nI'm somethin else with myself, the one night bandit\nI burn a broad head up - and then leave her stranded\nSee her next week again - this instant replay\nBut this time she got a friend - well we gon' do a 3-way\nI'm from Memphis mayne so the game come easy\nI pop 'em, in LAX, lotus or the prefix\nWell if you know Jack Frost, well then you know I love snows\nEspecially the ones that wanna hit me with the dough\nI'm on Ro-se-mo', two rolls in haze\nLookin for strange love, like Brigette and Flav'\nIf you wanna get saved - girl go to church\nBut if you wanna get laid - then it's time to twerk\nSo drink one of these, and smoke one of these\nYou ain't scared is ya~? Well pop one of these\nDrink one of these, smoke one of these\nA blonde and a brunette, I'ma knock both of these\nI told ya!\n\n[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]\n\n[Outro]\nThis goes out to my folks in the club\nPut your hands up in the air if you feel me\nGrind all day, party all night\nThen it's time to rolllllllll"}]}
