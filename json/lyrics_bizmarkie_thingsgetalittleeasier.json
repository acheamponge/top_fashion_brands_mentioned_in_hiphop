DAYS\nMy friend.. we thought they'd never end\nAnd she looked alright, to the S-K Biz Markie\nBut then she got on drugs\nStarted wearin extensions and rugs\nAnd let me tell you what say happened to Marie\n{*rapping*} because nowadays Marie don't look so hot\nEverytime that I see her, she's headed for the spot\nHer hair is all knotty, got Scotty got her body\nAnd her underarms kickin like the ho know karate\nHer clothes are real dirty, and usually the same\nAs for money she don't have a dime to claim\nBecause when I saw the girl the other day\nShe was puttin a pack of Now-or-Laters on layaway\n\n[Hook] - fades out"}], "artist": "Biz Markie"}
