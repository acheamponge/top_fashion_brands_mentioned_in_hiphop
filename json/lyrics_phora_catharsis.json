Yes!\nAsk me to explain, there's not enough time to show you all the Thoughts that I got locked in my mind\nListen my heart is as solid as Optimus Prime\nAnd my voice is almost as painful as Pac's in his Prime\nAnd the day I pass away is when the stars will align\nAnd the planets collide I see the light screamin', god\nSave my life from the violence I'm just fighting the odds\nLike a lion yo I fight for my pride\nThat's my people not my ego like a eagle visions Far as the skies\nLike a eagle visions far as the skies\nAnd they tell me that's the limit\nBut folks already made it to the moon\nSo I'll never stop reachin' till the day I'm in my tomb\nAnd when you at my funeral, dressed in all white\nPour some liquor out for me smoke session all night\nCause it's only right I'll be happy to see the light\nNo need to mourn my death just celebrate my life, look\n\n[Second Verse: Phora]\nI'm having trouble catching my breath\nHaving trouble seeing clearly I've been laughing at death Surrounded by the wolves, snakes and the vulture's waiting to hold ya\nWe dying out and there's no hope in saving the culture\nBut, before it's over it's all gonna' hit you\nCause you're just sitting on your ass instead of solving your issues\nAll these niggas want your neck and yeah they all gonna' get you\nWe gon' see how far that motherfuckin' talking will get you Homie I had to learn the hard way\nAlmost lost my life walking down Euclid St. and Broadway Wrong time wrong place\nJust thanking God one of them bullets didn't touch me\nBut, I had a couple friends in my life that ain't get so lucky Cause 7 month later, R2 from S.T.L got stuck outside of school And he died at the age of 12\nUsually I don't wish pain on a person\nBut I hope the motherfucker who did it rots in a fucking cell\n12 years with so many more to go\nWhy'd they have to do it we probably won't ever know\nIt's a never ending cycle\nBeen trying not to lose my faith, grippin' on a bible\nIt's like death is right behind you\nBut you keep movin' forward you trying to get away\nBut it just, keeps getting closer but you fight another day\nNever give up see that's the meaning of life\nAnd even when you're down there's always a reason to fight\nI said never give up that's the meaning of life\nAnd even when you're down there's always a reason to fight And even when you in the darkness yo just think of the light And just make sure they know my name if I stop breathing tonight\nYOURS TRULY!", "year": "2014-01-23"}]}
