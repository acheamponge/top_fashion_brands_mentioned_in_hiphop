Nigga I'll cut her up with the scissors\nLaid the skin out on the table able to stretch it\nPicture a nigga bathing in blood and butt naked\nI met her at the studio I put her my record\nTold her I'd give her an ass cap if she turned that ass backwards\nI lifted up the black skirt, stuck a N9ne in her\nPulled the trigger\nNow she gone and you eating her for dinner\nI never would have told y'all\nBut I love y'all niggas\nTold her my tour bunk was right above y'all niggas\nShe really wanted to see y'all\nBut I met her first\nShe told me she had a \u00a1MAYDAY!
