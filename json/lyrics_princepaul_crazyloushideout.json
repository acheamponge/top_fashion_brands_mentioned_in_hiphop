I love you\n\nTAMMY: Love you too. Buh-bye\n\nTRU: Aight, the first thing we gotta do is go get you a burner\n\nTARIQ: Yo, why I need a gun? Yo, Tru, you said it would be easy\n\nTRU: Protection, man, just protection. You should have one anyway\n\nTARIQ: True\n\nTRU: And we need to make a stop over at Crazy's lab. He's my weapons specialist\n\nTARIQ: You mean Crazy Lou's on 112th?\n\nTRU: Yeah, he no joke with the biscuits\n\nTARIQ (NARRATION): Now, Crazy Lou was always ill, but highly intelligent. He was an ex-Marine Captain who got discharged for sexual misconduct with a deadly weapon. Ever since then, he hasn't been the same. What's dope about Crazy is that he designs as well as modifies all types of weapons. He got this spot on 112th: an abandoned building, which he redesigned into a metal/weapon shop. Low maintenance, high security\n\nCRAZY LOU: What's the password, nerd?\n\nTRU: \"Enema bandit.\"\n\nCRAZY LOU: OK, enter slowly\n\nTRU: Yo, chill man, it's me, True! I got Tariq with me\n\nCRAZY LOU: Aww, fellas, come on in! Welcome to Weapon World, where if you find a weapon more high-powered at a lower price, I will give your girl a new weave!\n\nTRU: Yeah, OK. I need a weapon for my man Tariq. Today is his first day hustling, so I want to get him something high-powered yet economical, and...\n\nCRAZY LOU: Hmmm. Let me show you what I got. These are my latest designs!\n\nCOMPUTER: Enter voice authorization sample", "year": "1999-02-23"}]}
