I just remembered something from a long time ago, I think it may help you. Once, when I was little, I dropped my shoe into a river. When I tried to get it back, I fell in. I thought I'd drown but the water carried me to shore. It finally came back to me. The river's name was the Kohaku river. I think that was you, and your real name is Kohaku River\n\n[Chorus: Bones]\nWalking through the river, water in my shoes\nTrying to find my way back to where I found you\nWalking through the river, water in my shoes\nTrying to find my way back to where I found you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f47b5d790efa075451d60caf685ea148.960x960x1.jpg"}]}
