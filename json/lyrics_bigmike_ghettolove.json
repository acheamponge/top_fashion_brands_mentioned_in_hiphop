Yeah, it was like that\nDidn't sweat a bitch cause when I left she'd know I be right back\nWe might fight, black, but it never last long\nIf you try to come between us, nigga, get yo ass on\nLike them niggas that I hang with\nLet me know they ain't down, they tryina get at my thang and shit\nHad to know what has happenin\nWasn't like the average nigga gettin caught up in that high cappin\nWhat you got don't mean shit\nAnd I was quick to get in the mix behind my bitch\nFar from a trick, and never did she ask for shit\nEverything she got, she deserved it\nYoung love in the ghetto, hello\nKnew I had a down hoe, didn't wanna let go\nStraight based on trust\nAnd while other motherfuckers got crushed they couldn't fuck with us\nTo fuck with while we were rollin was unwise, G\nCause we were fully strapped, jammin them Isleys\n(Drifting on a memory)\nToo deep\n(Ain't no place I'd rather be)\nRollin with somethin sweet\nSo unique\nYou know where I wanna be?\nYeah\nKnow where I gotta be?\nYeah\nYou know where I'm at?"}], "artist": "Big Mike"}
