Music", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nNo matter how good a woman is, she still can't really teach him to be no man or daddy\n\n[Verse 1]\nUsed to walk around with a head full of naps\nChubby young kid with a head full of raps\nDoing what he can, just trying to adapt\nJumped to the block off of grandma's lap\nJumped to the block, so did every emcee\nBut gotta tell the truth, yeah, the block wasn't me\nLookin' for adventure, but the block was not\nThe block was real, Woo got killed\nHalf a year later, Big Spank got killed\nAnd I got robbed, and Ronnie got shot\nAnd I bought my first tape by 2Pac\nAnd I got hard, cause I was smart\nI knew that the weak and the meek couldn't make it in the street\nHad to assert yourself to survive\nSo I convinced myself it was better for me\nTo be Jack in The Lord of the Flies\nIt's a book I read, books I read\nCause I'm addicted to literature\nAs a young boy rollin' 'round with the clique\nCause of that I was insecure\nI was insecure cause I realized\nAin't no room for the civilized\nWhen the wild men rumble in the jungle\nAnd that's why Simon and Piggy died\nRalph survives, but he lives changed\nNothin's the same, shit'll drive a man out his brain\nDrive a young man insane\nMy cousin Jimmy had a breakdown he ain't never been the same\nAnd he never will be again\nIf I could fix his brain\nTake back the crack in his mind\nGive it all back, you can have the racks and fame\nI'd give it all back in exchange\n\n[Hook]\nThis is for the dads and the grandads\nAnd the little homies that ain't never had dads\nThis is for the uncles and the OGs\nAnd the lil homies, and the YGs\nThis is for the men I look up to\nAnd all the struggles that the men had to go through\nFor every man that's ever had to man up\nIf that's you, let me see you put your hands up\n\n[Verse 2]\nI lost my youth, chasin' my youth\nMade me a youth in the back of a coupe\nTeenage love, like Slick Rick said\nI hit her with my Dougie and I had a gold tooth\nFur Kangol, Filas too\nShe was light-skinned red gold tooth\nBut of course it didn't last cause I had to go to college\nAnd she was still in high school\nDamn, I'm a dad, this is bad\nThis ain't good, my baby's in the hood\nAnd I'm walkin' 'round the black ivy league campus\nLike I wish you house niggas would\nSo I go get a job, UPS\nWhere they treat you like BS and\nYou all know how the story goes\nDrop out of college and sell 'ses\nI figured I'd invest in studio time\nDrop rhymes, have success\nBut, mostly I got fronted on, stunted on\nNigga dealt with some stress\nI'll take that two, take that three\nCause my momma got to see me on TV\nAnd my grandmomma got to get her Grammy\nAnd my grandaddy got to see his boy eat\nSee his boy grow, I wish I never had that show\nI wish you never had to go\nWish you could meet my wife, wish you could see my life\nBut you had to see the light\nWish I had you one more day\nWish I had tomorrow that's your birthday\nWe can sip gin, straight get fade\nWe can ride old schools through the trey\n\n[Hook]"}]}
