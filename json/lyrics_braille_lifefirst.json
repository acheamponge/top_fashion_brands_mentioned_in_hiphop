define\nPlant my flag in this world of a spiritual state of mind\nMy rhymes shines light reflected from the divine\nKick a verse for the masses, change the face of mankind\nI'm blind in the flesh, some are blind to the truth\nIgnore something too long then it forgets about you\n[?] and that excuse\nWe're equal but the triangle of life is still obtuse\nDistribution of tattoos, don't try and remove\nThe storm is coming, Life was hitting store shelves like can foods\n(It's Braille's debut)\nGive me your attention\nI mention my vision for the sake of worldwide inspiration\nHijack habitats with text respiration\nMany sleeping on God, it's time to end hibernation\nThis isn't competition\nMy purpose won't be defeated\nI'm here to get you open\nOr at least open minded\nThe key to getting ahead has always been getting started\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nYou better hurry before you start hearing \"dearly departed\"\n\n[Braille]\nI keep my stand corrected\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nUnpredictable\n\n[Braille]\nUnexpected\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nBut constant with God in my heart because He's top selected\n\n[Braille]\nMy smile can't be adjusted by people who can't be trusted\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nCause if I let it my whole spirit will come busted\n\n[Braille]\nI'm guided through life course, through God's force I'm protected\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nRespect it cause it's keeping me cool calm and collected\n\n[Braille]\nNot interested in the amounts you count when you're paid\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nCause the money will go but your soul will never fade\n\n[Braille]\nI could care less how fresh you are in a claim\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nYou're lame, chill with that or be destroyed by your fame\n\n[Braille]\nIt's all the same, the only change is who's behind it\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nRise, open your eyes stop walking this Earth blinded\n\n[Braille]\nBack in the day, hip hop was my only work\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nBut now I'm a child of God I've put life first\n\n[Hook]\n[B] When I inflict pain\n[S] It's cause the truth hurts\n[B] I do a lot of things\n[S] But keep life first\n[B] There's more than hip hop to express in a verse\nI write what I live, and live life first\n[B] When I inflict pain\n[S] It's cause the truth hurts\n[B] I do a lot of things\n[S] But keep life first\n[B] There's more than hip hop to express in a verse\nI pay rent with happiness, live life first\n\n[Verse Two: Storm The Unpredictable]\nNow look here\nSomebody told me it was all about flows, bank rolls and hoes\nI beg to differ\nComing from the non coke sniffer\nThe non weed smoker\nThe non alcohol [?]\nThe brother who was looking forward to meeting his maker\nStorm the Unpredictable\nFlows are hot\nHip hop means a lot to me but it is not all that I got\nI heard Common say that\nThat brother made Sense\nNegativity stay back, I'll turn down on it before I\nSold out my soul to the evils of this nation\nI would repeat that statement with no trace of hesitation\nDon't get me wrong, sometimes I fall into temptation\nDone things that had my family worried and pacing\nBut God's got my back now I don't worry who I'm facing\nThe higher power\nTurns things sweet when sour\nI'm serious about this, life comes first\nBefore I step on stage and verbally disperse\nThat's why to make money I will not curse\nCause what's worse\nThe cheddar doesn't matter in a hearse\nWhat does matter is the way you've lived your days\nThe way you've affected lives in your path I pray\nThat you will, put good use to these words I say\nCause rhyme is not just abuse with your verb display\nServes I made remind you of cause I drop bombs\nWhen it was sent by the creator so no need for alarm\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three: Braille]\nThe things I'm called to speak put all my dreams in reach\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nBy example I teach\nMy ways and actions preach\n\n[Braille]\nI think it's time to expand upon my past attempts\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nBefore you think we're all a bunch of players, prostitutes and pimps\n\n[Braille]\nPutting a price on head checks\nIt's my mind well spent\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nSome of you between the ears don't have one red cent\n\n[Braille]\nI've meant what I said while others keep cutting corners\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nThat's the reason that families have turned into mourners\n\n[Braille]\nWe don't show your true colors like ink and black and white pictures\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nThe words we bring register 10 on the Richter\n\n[Braille]\nIt's about having confidence in the message you deliver\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nAnd constantly being called \"the unselfish giver\"\n\n[Braille]\nReality hit you harder than a championship boxer\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nDon't let the ills of this world outfox ya\n\n[Braille]\nIn the days when [?] exchange pages for pacemakers\n\n[Storm The Unpredictable]\nAnd they learn that we're afraid so who's waiting to undertake ya?\n\n[Braille]\nI look at the future and wonder where time went\nI'm upset that so much going down is incorrect\nThere's different sides of the fence to make it all make sense\nMy contents intense, it's knowledge you need to get\nI'm not out to prove who's more intelligent\nI just ask you look at music as more than entertainment\nTo me it's evident those that talk about guns\nWill eventually end up being shot by one\nDon't argue till I'm done, these are my concepts\nMy tongue ain't involved in that traditional nonsense\nI'm drug free\nYou can't control me with a substance\nI'm hooked on God, life, the mic and my subconscious\nIt's obvious, my image won't sell magazines\nBut if it does than maybe this song changed some things\nSee I live life before I grab the mic\nSo on the mic I display life\n\n[Hook]", "year": "1999-01-01", "album": "Lifefirst: Half The Battle"}], "artist":
