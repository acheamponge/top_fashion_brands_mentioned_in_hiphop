Joe]\nYo\nWe got broke niggas woke niggas who want smoke niggas\nI fucked with Scott Storch so you know we got coke\nNiggas fake with having I'm lacing karats\nDarlings in the states and Paris amazed the fabrics\nI was rich when they wasn't still rich when you was\nMen it is what it is I'm a habitual plug\nIf I said it you say I was pathological\nGot shot twice a night I checked myself out the hospital\nI was pumping Keith Sweat had the gun in these sweats\nTalks of killing his mom's I couldn't live with regrets\nCoco\nYo-oh yo-oh\nSo many bitches I swear I'm a dickless\nNow that the bags is different to talk different\nAlright here we go\n\nYo here we go\n\nYo\n\nSo many bitches I swear I'm a dickless\nNow that the bags is bigger they talk different\nShe want the best life now so here's your wish miss\nWe've been shitting or some about to do Christmas\nOff white colored a truck to the hood love them toys\nAin't no future and there's some good love and joy\nSkin brown color on the joy\nWe mashed potatoes on the arms to avoid the noise\nI told flex I'm a thug man I'm a die fly\nChanel forego 60 bands New York's flag\nI chop the top off the Porshe when it we convert\nMy Cleopatra in Dubai try make me convert, I'm saying\nSalam alaykom my uni country you know listen\nUm\nTrendsetters pristine boys niggas their ice\nWe woke up at the awards every rapper just like me\nI inspire the bosses\nShit I've been moving white like fire in crosses\nNo trump intended\nMade me a menace that's work on the team playing when\nZach was on Memphis\nWhen he win for the grounds real don't tell you how\nThere's some other motherfucking clown will\nAnd you could think spike for the motion pictures\nA couple Jesus ain't nice that's the frozen scriptures\nTeam rocking I mean Remi popping Drake popping\nPick and roll caught him (M)alone and I'm Stockton\nAnd you wonder why them niggas depress\nWe selling the same dope I just picture the best, is coca\n\n[Verse 2: Mysonne]\n\nUh-huh yeah\nI done survive in the Bronx amongst killers and thieves\nHustled in the cold and below zero degrees\nI'd have seen shit that most probably wouldn't believe\nSo the second time on Flex fitting to be a breeze\nYo Flex respect to all these MCs stepping this far\nThe lyrical MCs please keep rapping them bars\nThe bar set they reach now I'm resetting that bar\nPromised y'all by tomorrow I'm gonna be mentioned with God\nThis is me catching the charge, premeditated murder one\nThe cheese like my son the truth you never heard a son\nHuh you heard I'm fronting, then somebody lied\nYou heard somebody did something to me somebody died\nAnd if they didn't kill him, bet somebody tried\nSo if he's still alive then God was on somebody's side\nSomebody try to defined Myse no definition\nOne of the best cats that'spitting that get no recognition\nI repping dudes sitting in prison when 90 something didn't numbers\nAnd 90 summers to some of our closest friends from us\nDumb us we let these retreats not much\nJay Z tried tell us don't let this shit become us\nWhat you see that's how they want us beef and fueling\nAmong us chasing the fame wearing the same chains that hung us\nThen they lock us up for the same cane that brung us\nWe got to change the game but just maintain the hunger\nThe aim is getting younger they're shooting at our babies now\nFeminizing men, dudes moving like ladies now\nThey said you sound like a hater sometimes I say\nNah I tell the truth is only hate when you lying\nThey've been waiting to find my kind\nDivine being a shining McDonald's climax by just using my mind\nCuz nah I don't touch 'em see what they did to Russell\nSome of these chicks done turning rape into hustle\nNow have you really been assaulted and rape mind me I love you\nI swear if I was there how to shot the coward for you\nBut listen I'm trying to tell you that shit is a scam\nThey trying to divide the black women and men\nSo as the black man I stand right up here and I apologize\nFor that pain and neglect that left ya traumatize\nYou see when my father died I swear my mama tried\nTo turn me to a man I ain't fell she is qualified\nThat's why I went outside and I witnessed the homicides\nAnd the drug dealers whoever was shooting we idolize\nThat's why I despise when the rats got idolized\nYou played the game of snitch technical fault you disqualified\nNigga I defied them odds and I survived\nI'm 2Pac Shakur meets knowledge is modernized\nThey say that I provide a feeling that's undenied\nBarring nobody I am the realest nigga alive\nYour feelings then you died or you just dealing with pride\nYeah I know that I be spreading all bullshit and decides\nFor the minute that y'all decide to celebrate authenticity\nEvery category you have it's gonna mention me nigga\nI gave him history facts bars consistently\nHow the hell they don't respect that it's a mystery\nSo fuck y'all listen they don't mean shit to me\nSeeing my people revolve is my victory\nHarry Belafonte well I call him Mr. B\nSaid I had a gift God gave that gift to me\nTo lead the people from bondage and out of misery\nSwami speak the truth to the Reaper come and visit me\nYou see my mission different that's why I see shit differently\nShit you might see a success I might disagree\nChick you might be paying for sex I might get for free\nI think it's lame to pay for sex but it might just be me\nMaybe it's just the grease, levels and different leagues\nI'm war already that's why I'm always in fatigue\nListen please, don't get it confused because\nI'm elevating them switching my views and I'm uplifting my dudes\nI flip quick you get shit misconstrued\nAnd I put a nigga in the clip on the news\nSo you're gonna choose which one you want me this preaching the unity\nOr to me that be the reason your people reading your eulogy\nI know it's a contradiction understand it's two of me\nIt's the goons Myse from the Bronx then it's the new of me\nIt's the whole of me that's comfortable where the shooters be then the revolutionary newer version of Huey P\nFlex can you agree that I did what I told you\nI came up here and I shifted the culture they listening closer\nThey robbed me different they don't switch they approach up\nThat bullshit spitting is over now and they listened to Hova\n4:44 tell me I aspire death I'm flattered but I ain't really buying that\nBut what I will say is that they wasn't jacking that kind of rap\nBefore I came up here stop me where I'm lying at\nIron sharpens iron nigga I brought the fire back\nI eat a tiger I brought lions that retired back\nReal going admire that but the fake going down play\nSwear these squares uncomfortable around me. Why?\nCuz I proudly point out they fraudulence\nThen I expose these actors to their audience\nY'all be ignorant that they don't move according to that shit that they recording and y'all still applaud it, me?\nI'm reporting it live from the corners\nWhen they do crime and get more time than Warner\nYou see, I'm trying to warn you it's no more honor nah\nThey done trading these principles for designer\nYour right-hand man might kill you for some vagina\nAnd the so called jeez get pistols to the minors\nAnd this will y'all be trying to compare to me\nFrom where I swear this whole industry scared of me  it's clear\nThis shit it's just like breathing enemies I'm guard here\nYou should be making a prayer to me it's rare\nYou'll see another rapper that's this complete\nThat speak like a scholar while honor like Pistol Pete\nWhen his drama I'm the piranha trying to get the meat pause\nI'm kind of like white collar mixed with street on my momma\nI'm just the lead I'm not heart beat her the streets\nI am the place where life and art seem to meet\nSee first I palm heat then I laid on Palm Beach\nNow I got the world on my palm my song speak\nAnd they stop looking they listen, they pay attention\nBecause they be saying the same shit I just say it different\nI just paint a picture of dimensions they can't mention\nCuz they ain't bended it when they spit it it ain't convincing\nThe image they predict ain't the position\nThe image they predictable bars ain't their position\nOf course everybody gonna say they was in the kitchen\nBut what about the block getting locked facing that prison\nWhen either you gonna tell what you won't sit in that cell\nEverybody a G before that that's when it's real\nNow that's when you can tell the morals have finished still\nWhen your back against the wall your character get revealed\nSo either you gon' squeal and try to make you a deal\nOr you're gonna pick 12 and you lose weight on the pill\nI know that and going pill to a coward or civilian\nWith the Gs no I just kept with a million\nTell me how does it feel you sit witnessing greatness\nThe doubters is sick I know that haters gonna hate this\nWith the real rice been waiting for me to take this game\nBack from the fake so please pardon my lateness but\nI was busy fighting for freedom\nThese kids needed food for thought I had to feed them\nThey needed something to follow I had the lead 'em\nMen of honour was becoming this thing I had to breed them\nChicks keep calling me God all in my DMs\nNo disrespect but God ain't that your BM\nGuess she realized your fraud\nSee, a queen could tell the difference between a king\nAnd the pawn when she see him\nAnd yup I am here my motto is copper dim\nGrowing up in the Bronx and my heart darker than p.m\nAnd pool full of sharks I learned to swim\nThey hid their hands after they threw the rocks that I turned into gems\nNigga we turning men way before puberty shit\nBy age ten it wasn't nothing y'all could do to me\nAmerica have ruined me. Poverty, real hunger\nOppression, pain, same shit that may kill Manga\nAnd they still wonder what I'm marching for\nTo identify allies when it's time for war\nWhich I'll gonna do when they declare martial law\nAnd then the soldier with guns knocking at your door, huh?\nYou ain't even prepared\nThe revolution done starting you ain't even aware\nYou see the Dred Scott case takes\nWe can't be free and these United States cause we ain't even from here\nLong as I'm breathing this air until it's even and fair\nI'ma fight cuz one thing I don't believe in it's fear\nI guess the reason I'm here is to maintain the balance nigga\nI'm the place between peace and balance\nBetween screaming and silence ignorance acknowledge nigga\nJust fighting off these demons is a challenge\nIt is the talent just keepin my composure\nWhile you beef with me knowing I could fold you\nKnowing if I told my soldier he would mow you\nDown like a lawn you see is pros vs. cons\nIs knowing that I'm in the right but it's still wrong\nIt's chess why sacrifice the knight for a pawn\nYo flex I'm gone before I leave your residence\nI hope you realize this is black excellence\nThis is black brilliance black power resilience\nThe Black Panther, not to film, the real shit\nThis black Wall Street time to rebuild this\nWe need a thousand Oprah's and a thousand Will Smith's\nWe need celebrities of a higher pedigree\nTo have some integrity that one to leave a legacy\nShit I'm fighting for I'm probably ain't gonna never see\nBut my kids will just hope today remember me\nHope today remember he defied the odds\nHe played the hand he was dealt never shuffle the cards\nA-1 since day one he never fuck with no frauds\nHe frontlined and never get you nothing but bars\nNothing but the uncut raw shit they make your nose bleed\nThe Bible verses the shit that niggas souls need\nThe OG told me it was designed to divide us brother\nCuz even in Wakanda we is fighting each other\nSo just imagine if we was all fighting together\nWe all be winning and all of our lives would be better\nGood people died just so I can have a life\nAnd that's why I give my life as a sacrifice\nGood people died just so I can have a life\nAnd that's why I gave my life as a sacrifice", "title": "Fat Joe & Mysonne Freestyle on Flex | Freestyle #103"}]}
