(yes you can) {*3X*}\nWell I'm gone (go on then)\n\nCan I kick it,to all my people who get wicked like Sage does\nBefore this did you know what my real name was\nPaul Francis acting like he's on the same drugs\nNever even felt the effects of a strange buzz\nYou never ever catch me holding a beer mug\nYour talking shit like as if you was a real thug\nIf that's true lick a shot BUCK feel the slug\nThat's what you get for totin guns like you were Elmer Fudd\nI'm selling tapes for three bones wanna catch a dub?\nThis shit is dope kid it makes you wanna cut the rug\nIlluminati's got every part of my body bugged\nThe micro chip is in your wrist now give it a tug\nBe nice to females give a bitch a hug\nTriple X styles coming cleaner than your tub\nYou better tell your girl about it because she's a scrub\nA big problem that I had to nip in the bud\nDropping me her seven digits while I'm in the club\nTalking 'bout I look I need a back rub\nSon she's a natural disaster like a flash flood\nI ain't playin dawg you better go test her blood\nUntil your positive she's negative don't make no love\nWith or without a glove, you know what I'm speaking of\nThe cub scouts try and jump into the briney shrubs\nBehind the bush turn a back push into a shove\nWhat you thinking trying bring the underground above?\nAOI make you cry like a dove,for that shit,for that shit\n\n(chorus)", "album": null}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
