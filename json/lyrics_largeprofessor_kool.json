You need devotion\nSome night and day skills and a whole lot of heart\nAnd you got to be strong to hold down the part\nThat I'm holding\nStraight out the flicks I'm golden\nWhen numb girls be on my dick I got a Trojan\nNot a single cat, rat or roach and\nMy category prepare for the explosion\nKa-Boom\nGive me some elbow room\nGod said everybody in this world gon' bloom\nAnd blossom\nThats it cause dudes is playing possum\nAlways act brand new i wouldn't gas em\nQueens group therapy\nWho's on tour\nGuarantee i have the crowd saying \"do an encore\"\nI'm persistent, come through hardcore\nGet mad rich on those dudes that's unsure\nKool\n\n[Verse 2: Large Pro]\nSpinning round and round with my potion\nLike Smokey Robinson kid i got the notion\nOne day when i was spinning in the whip tight posting\nAt the maximum speed like chicks like motion\nP like the green stuff\nEspecially cabbage\nAnd i slang that slang stuff better than average\nAct stupid and i turn into veteran savage\nYo I'm saying I'm fucking putting heads in the garbage\nNot a tyrant\nBut an MC just like Pirate\nSee me on the Tv as the black private\nDetective\nMany can't see his perspective\nThat's why the man Ex-P has been selected\nOn the jukebox\nAll you hearing is fake 2pacs\nTalking like they brand new out the box\nStop the madness\nY'all some fake guild of radness\nAll i want you to do is feel the blackness\nKool\n\n[Verse 3: Large Pro]\nI be the black laid back on a friday night\nTuning in on the heavy-weights as they fight\nFor a belt and some cash and they spot in the light\nJust thinking to myself \"kid you gotta get right\"\nAll the years you out in this bullshit business\nYou gotta give these cats a miracle to witness\nFor real\nYou the one that got blessed with skill\nNo time to be thinking about the next man\nStill\nYou extend a helping hand\nYou not a selfish man\nThey try to work you over\nBut you was built to stand\nOn the highest heights\nPenthouse levels\nAnd how before they went out just like devils\nIt's typical\nYou dig back in the Biblical\nStories\nThat'll put your mind at ease\nWith the happen\nThis here is deeper than rapping\nIts time to be free\nEx-P i be the captain\nIt's Kool"}], "artist": "Large Professor"}
