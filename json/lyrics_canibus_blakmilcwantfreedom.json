When I wake up (when I wake up) and look around\nAnd wonder how (I wonder how) can I get out\nGet off to far (get off to far) beyond the gates\nI jump then run (I jump then run) but I get chased\nYou can't escape (you can't escape) that's what they say\nBut I got away (I got away) and made 'em pay\nFor what they done (for what they done) to what I love\nHip-Hop rhymes over erratic drums\nBlow your horns, here the cavalry comes\nBlakmilc motherfucker and we fight 'til the tragedy's done\nNo matter where they be attackin me from\nMy heart pumps pure gasoline, and my eyes shine like the sun\nMotherfuckers talk shit but they bums, I crush 'em like crumbs\nScream at the top of my lungs, that's what they want\nThis is Blakmilc baby, you never give up\nLivin it up, I'm rapid-fire tearin shit up, what?\n\n{*guitars and drums to end*}"}]}
