Player, stop playing.  Yo\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nThis is SportsVille, thoughts kill just like Ds\nI read, study lessons, build my \u201cDegrees\u201d\nWalk with athletic, I become aesthetic\nMy flows put egos on the injured list\nCatch an assist to the medics when I set it\nYo, I \u201cMake It Happen\u201d\u2014nobody let it\nMotivated by critics and skeptics\nAnd still bubble my stat on the low in tanks of septic\nTriple-double bond to myself, power forward\nDrop steps, slap backboards, leave rims swollen\nElbows fall on your face like Hulk Hogan\nHalf-court trap.  Now you stuck\u2014where you going?\nGetting off the train like (Boom boom), controlling y\u2019all\nClosing doors, envision myself as a bowling ball\nThe peoples are pins\u2014I strike to get out\nBut they too gutter to fall in\u2014no doubt\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nThis is SportsVille, thoughts kill just like Ds\nSurrounded by players, this MC referee\nWhether you above the rim or beneath the gutter\nThis is the game of life\u2014you\u2019ll soon discover\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nDressed up\u2014foreign uniform.  It\u2019s steel through your peephole\nSlam dunking tracks for nothing\u2014call it a free throw\nTeam Cactus.  Selfish actions make you warm the bitch\nBall \u2018til you fall, prepare for the tournament\nI drop fluids like water boys for soul quenching\nThinking \u201cLong Range,\u201d always goaltending\nSending you back to the locker with your season slow-ending\nMy co-defenders are so relentless\nFull-court pressure.  My opponents lie swollen\nWhose thought lesser.  Triangle offense\u2014wide-open\nBehold the pyramid.  The hole\u2014there it is\nExplode like strange science experiments\nOne-on-one.  Cheat, you a dead man\nA bubblegum explosive placed in your headband\nDetonated by a button in my wristband\nThink that\u2019s ill?  Chill.  Just wait \u2018til I switch hands\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nThis is SportsVille, thoughts kill just like Ds\nSurrounded by players, this MC referee\nWhether you above the rim or beneath the gutter\nThis is the game of life\u2014you\u2019ll soon discover\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nTime out!  Let\u2019s huddle, get the cypher correct\nAnd find out why vets struggling, fight for a check\nTo intercept your intellect, first down: some respect\nIn life, bang in the paint like it\u2019s three seconds left\nUnderstand the scoreboard, don\u2019t beef with the rep\nWhen traveling, watch you feet, peep step\nHair-salon-style\u2014pass the tracks, bubble weekly\nAnd my cuts keep Barbers running back like Tiki (What he say?)\nInstant replay in slow motion\nRocking a New Jersey like Hoboken\nDo the knowledge to those who suppose checking your style\nWon\u2019t lead to a technical foul is hectic and wild\nBoth sneakers tied together\u2014I feel y\u2019all tripping\nIllegal defense\u2014now here\u2019s the tip-in\nThis is the bright highlight.  Freeze the frame\nAnd look at the Wizards\u2014true players never leave the game\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nThis is SportsVille, thoughts kill just like Ds\nSurrounded by players, this MC referee\nWhether you above the rim or beneath the gutter\nThis is the game of life\u2014you\u2019ll soon discover"}]}
