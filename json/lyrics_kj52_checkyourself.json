Oh NO you didn't...\n\nUncle KJ gotta talk to ya'll kids\nListen up quick cause the way some ya'll live\nMust have lost ya mind and just flipped ya lid\nNow ladies I know what he be telling you\nI know cause back in the day I used to do it too\nTalking about aww girl you know I love you\nAnd if love me too then let me sleep with you ooh\nHe's a fool a lying scheming dude\nI'm a tell ya straight girl now cut him loose\nWhy ain't no guy that cute\nIf he won't respect for you and won't wait for you\nSee you need a real man that loves God too\nAnd will take a stand even if it's hard to\nAnd I know that you can now it's worth it for you\nCheck the program this is what i'm telling you\n\nChorus:\nOoohh ya'll better check yo self, nah ya'll need to check yo self\nUn uh ya better check yo self, no ya'll better just respect yo self\nOoohh ya'll better check yo self, nah ya'll need to check yo self\nUn uh ya better check yo self, no ya'll better just respect yo self\n\nWhere my fellas at where my fellas at?\nNow some of ya'll need to check where ya head is at\nI know in the locker room what they be talling cats\nDon't buy into that now when they selling that\nVirgin ain't a dirty word don't be ashamed of that\nSee in reality people be respecting that\nStand up for yourself tell em just chill with that\nAnd even if they diss turn around and bless em back\nLet em talk smack and leave it at that\nCause everybody ain't doin it now just learn that facts\nDon't never let somebody ever hold ya back\nNobody except God should ever tell ya how to act\nIt's God saying that cause peeps won't tell ya that\nBut it's the truth and I'll never back down from that\nSo if ya can ya handle that and like the sound of that\nThen people halla back on the track if ya down with that\n\nWhat are you trying to say man\n\nChorus\n\nLadies and gentlemen ya need to stop playing\nStop running around always missionary dating\nYou think that the one you're loving you gonna be saving\nBut end up with problems from the choice ya making\nNow some ya'll girls ya'll need to start caring\nAnd think twice about all these clothes that ya wearing\nI know it might be nice to have all the guys staring\nBut take advice respect yourself as a woman\nWe all want love and we all want attention\nBut that ain't the way to get it you understand what I'm saying?\nWith the baby gap outfit on that ya wearing\nSneaking out the house trying to hide from ya parents\nSee God said save yourself for ya marriage\nAnd it was for a reason don't misunderstand it\nSex is a beautiful gift don't mishandle it\nYa better check yourself and don't damage it\n\nChorus:"}]}
