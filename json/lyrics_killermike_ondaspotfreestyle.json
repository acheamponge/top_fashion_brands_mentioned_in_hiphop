I'm a sparrow\nIt's real G, ho, to the bone marrow\nI get you back today and see your ass tomarrow\nI put the bullet through your tendons and your marrow\nI heard your mama saying \"naw! take me, Lord!\"\nYou rap good? Put a bullet through your *vocal* chords\nIt's right nigga, get it on, I'm a real G\nYou sweet, Kool Aid, straight Hi-C\nWhen I'm high, I swear I could see the G-O-D\nHeaven in the mirror: I'm just seeing me..\nIt's God in the buiding, niggas better know that\nA righteous rapper, yeah, hey I know crack\nI sat right in front & trapped in front of your house\nI had scholarships still: went to Moorehouse\nI know pyrex, I know the good cook\nAn educated villain, I can ? a good book\nA good book, a good magazine clipped on\nI hit your house, have your girl get her strip on\nI get your Benz homie, then I get the strip on\nI'm on the Martin Luther King, you know, strip homes\nYou say you wanna find me, I'm at Thai Land\nTonight I'm with the G's, catch me in the blue flame.."}]}
