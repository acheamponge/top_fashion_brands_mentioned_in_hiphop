Now everybody mad cause I don't speak\nWe welcome to Hollywood, I was born here I can act Hollywood\nI'm going in, mock me, with a rock star crew like Motley\nCross, God couldn't stop me, I can feel it getting closer than a Mach 3\nMach speed, high up\nI can see the game, from the skybox, shades always on like Cyclops\n\n[Chorus: Sterling Simms]\nAll I know, better bring out ya shades for all those flashing light\nThey can make you blind\nAll I know, you probably can't see my wings\nBut I'm gon' touch the sky, all I got is time\n\n[Verse 2: Kid Ink]\nYeah, and I can't waste none, but I got a little money we can waste some\nSee through you lames like a lace front, I came from the bottom like a bass drum\nUsed to stand outside of the club, know if I ain't about it then I ain't in the club\nSoon as I walk in they eyeing in the club, bum ass niggas all they got is a mug\nAnd I thank God from above, that I ain't getting locked up or dying from a slug\nWe just rhyming for love and I just want fans like I wear shiny gloves\nCause I'm off the wall, headed to the sky like I'm off the law\nTreat it like Trina, I'mma beat the odds, bitch\n\n[Chorus: Sterling Simms]\nAll I know, better bring out ya shades for all those flashing light\nThey can make you blind\nAll I know, you probably can't see my wings\nBut I'm gon' touch the sky, all I got is time\n\n[Verse 3: Kid Ink]\nYeah, I said you better get your Ray Bans, you can find me where the shade ends\nI keep it real no pretend, you motherfuckers faker than a spray tan\nTake another look a your G shot, I'm 'bout to blow up like a G Hiad\nNo rush, have patience cause all I got is time like flavour\nHere we go again, I'm not the one to go against\nI'll crush you niggas like a soda can, man\n\n[Chorus: Sterling Simms]\nAll I know, better bring out ya shades for all those flashing light\nThey can make you blind\nAll I know, you probably can't see my wings\nBut I'm gon' touch the sky, all I got is time"}]}
