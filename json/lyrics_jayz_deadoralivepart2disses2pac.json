See where your luck go, you know what though?\nI'm what you don't get a second chance at\nThink you can chance that?\nI'm laying niggas down ba'y bro\nThink you can stand that?\nYour train of thought derails like amtrak\nMy grand stack, hands free and a six; vivid jam-packed\nMe, my crimees, and a couple of dime pieces\nA bunch of rolexes, unlimited credit line visas\nHeat is for niggas that want to touch but can't reach us\nTo each his own y'all can eat this chrome\nLeave him speechless when the lead reaches his dome\nLife ain't nothing but beaches and homes", "title": "Dead or Alive, Part 2 (Disses 2pac)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf0f68ee56f29c8542ad805c6419682b.676x676x1.jpg", "year": null, "album": null}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
