It's for my people\nThe LP, it's for my people\nThe LP, it's for my people\nThe LP, it\u2019s for my people\nThe LP\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's right on time with the dirt and the grime\nThe LP, and insert and to climb\nUp all the charts, on all the pop tarts\nThat call themselves \"Keepin' it real\", but got hearts\nMade of plastic, man, I get busy on the dizzy\nI rock ya whole show and have you askin' \"Boy, is he?\nThe midnight marauder or what?\" 'Cause on the cut\nI remain and I'm representin' Queens, maintain\nLots of knowledge, 'cause this world is my college\nWhere I teach and breach your whole contract, jack\nGo with Large Pro and only get fact\nNon-fiction, but layin' with mad prop addiction\nWit' a twist of rhyme, it's that time\nFor me to not keep prolongin' and born\nOnce again to my friends, this name of this song is...\n\n[Hook]\nFor my people\nThe LP, it's for my people\nThe LP, it's for my people\nThe LP, it's for... for... for...\n\n[Scratched and repeated till the end]\nLP!"}], "artist": "Large Professor"}
