"[Verse]\nThis that sick rap, kick back, come to where I pitch at\nWhere bitches love The Game like Tyson Beckford six pack\nPresidential Rollie, nigga, where your wrist at?\nI can kill you in four bars, that's a Kit Kat\nDid the Lambo my way with a sick wrap\nSmooth as Frank Sinatra with a motherfucking slick back\nNo rats in my pack, ain't no wrinkles in my slacks\nCounting singles in my Shaqs, stacking Pringles from the crack\nNigga I was on the bus with it\nHad 12 stuck to my chest in the field with the colt\nAndrew Luck with it\nWe had the rock, hit the block like what's up with it\nJay was in the Z, my young gunnas in the truck with it\nSigel would've loved it, Philly would've fucked with it\nCalifornia state property you niggas stuck with it\nBrrrring, sold Peedi Crakk\nGame was on the block in his beanie with a Mac\nI'm what you rap niggas 'fraid of\nA Compton nigga that could go bar for bar with Jada\nLet me tell you who suck, like banana Now or Laters\nBlac Chyna head the bomb, al-Qaeda\nListen, you want beef I'll cater\nGame snap on everything he like a fucking wild gator\nSilver and black Ghost, nigga that's Al Davis\nGive me Left Eye back, take Fetty Wap and the Raiders\nThe Rams is back, them bullets getting tossed\n16 on your back like you fucking Jeff Goff\nYour man acting girly too put 30 on his chest\nKanye shrug bitch, welcome to the west\nYG, Nipsey, and Kendrick yea check\nShout 'em out I just do it like a fucking Nike rep\nBentley truck Chuck, with the Henny cupped up\nDon't get me fucked up, you see the semi tucked, duck\nPass the Goose, where them duck ducks?\nThese hoes foaming at the mouth, they got Penny fucked up\nI'm 'bout to poke 'em like a cactus\nTold that bitch to roll the Philly for the game, and she talking about practice\nThe Maybach is A.I\nArtificial intelligence motherfucker that's Junior Seau\nAll my doors suicide, I'm in Vegas shoot the five\nTell the dealer pay me don't be shy he ain't from Do or Die\nNow do you wanna ride, back seat of my Caddy?\nUsed to flip them pies ain't no relation to Patti\nAnd I move Ps, ain't no relation to Swaggy\nBefore that it was missing teeth and nickel sack baggies\nThat's caine, no daddy cause I ain't really have one\nAnd you can't call yourself dope if you ain't never bag none\nI'm the old DMX you niggas Drag-On\nGame raw as fuck like poking holes in the Magnum\nUsed to ether the niggas in all of my 16s\nNow I scare 'em once a year like I'm fucking Halloween\nThis ain't a dream, nigga hurricane a nightmare\nStab you in your sleep and smack your baby out his highchair\nYour daddy was a bitch, I had to do it\nI ain't need no ski mask to do it\nMurder is Rihanna and I'm attracted to it\nName a state, I'll send a package through it\nIf the fed hack into it, they get bossed on like I'm Massachusetts Huh!\nSitting in this Maybach with music\nYour head is like Mustard beat and I'll put the ratchet to it\nPARTY sent my jackas to it\nDrama bring the Mac into it\nAnd this scope will get your mouth washed when I attach it to it\nGold on my neck, I make your bitch put her back into it\nUsain Bolt if you bring a real track into it\nAnother classic moving the way to Aftermath to do it\nDre had the Chronic all I did was put the matches to it\nTraffic moving backwards through it\nEver since I had the Buick\nKnown for putting cheese on niggas heads the way the Packers do it\nAnd I had the yay, yea I brought crack to music\nEvery situation in rap, I've been a savage through it\nAnd all these hoes getting mad cause I'm smashing through 'em\nThey can get a ring one day, if the Cavs can do it\nBe LeBron bitch, I'm Jayceon bitch\nWho else you seen parked at the swap meet in James Bond shit?\nAnother foreign car driven by a convict\nAventador matte black Akon lips\nNas ether niggas, Game napalm shit\nNiggas say my name I pop up like the State Farm bitch\nNo nigga can see me, on or off TV\nGum bottom Yeezys, I'm the 6' 5\" Eazy\nLightskin bitches be mad and talking greasy\nI'ma start fucking them Dej Loafs and Dreezy's\nI'ma start beefing with Cole, Drizzy and Cornrow Kenny\nOr you could pick your favorite rapper, and he gon' be pouring out Henny\nI got a bitch from Minne-Apolis pack a semi\nBang the ratchet at Denny's and fly herself back to Philly\nShe got a couple mill and she don't even know Meek\nAnd ever since that nigga snitched on me we just don't speak\nSee that shit you got with Drake is like a slow leak\nBlood'll be dripping like Niagara if I poke Meek\nNicki won't get no sleep, I'm coming through at 4 a.m\nFour deep, to leave his dead body on the soaked sheets\nIt could happen lowkey\nYou better have Ross call me or you gon' be eye level with a roach feet\nThis ain't a diss, nigga\nThis is all lives matter except this nigga's\n\n[Outro: The Game]\nThis 1992 shit ain't no new shit\nWe in that all black you won't know who Blood and who Crip\nWith guns big enough to sink a fucking cruise ship\nFuck around and be a news clip with them loose lips\nMy nigga Drizzy packed you out and you ain't do shit\nThis the Golden State and my shooters ain't on no hoop shit\nNigga, you know that I'll snap you like a toothpick\nAnd snitching on niggas ain't never been no cool shit\nAnd I've been wanting to give Nicki this pool stick\nSo tell your lil' vivrant thing come fuck with Q-Tip\nWe know where you live, nigga, you better move quick\nAnd start thinking twice about who you hop in the coupe with"}]}
