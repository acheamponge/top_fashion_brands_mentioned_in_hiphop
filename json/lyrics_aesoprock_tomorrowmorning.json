Here are:\nDebauchery, disease, insanity, blasphemy, death\nAnd hell, yawning to receive its putrid mass.\"\n\n(The ground shook, and the sky burned...)\n\n[Verse 1: Aesop Rock]\nThese are the unregulated rabbit holes\nBarrack homes and taverns built for devil's acre\nOpium enthusiasts and baritones, marigold\nThe garish allure of the burning Barbary\nUnderbelly born of 40 thieves in whorish harmony\nHammering for the dark and heartless\nHarpy, shark and harlot argue breathing room\nDo not let the arson jeeper-creeper you\nIf we elect the scenic route see it as greener grasses\nLike morphine after snatch help you forget diseases matter\nNot to mention 15 cents for either weakens cheaper gamblers\nDown for hell inside a melting pot\nNo one's ever melting they just yell a lot\nStab each other, drink and eat and belly-flop\nMurder Point, your thoroughfare at 12 o'clock\nIs hell and back, EMB to Chinatown\nKearny clashing cutters out the netherworld\nSydney ducks to pistol fuck the centerfold\nEvery cellar iniquity, pretty killers and pistol petes\nMight wake up to horses tearing at your limbs symmetrically\n\n[Hook] x2\nTomorrow morning when the wharf is finished warping\nYou will wash up on the shore and wonder what was so alluring\n(El-P)\nTomorrow evening when the leeches finish feeding\nYou'll regret the ownership of an aorta that is bleeding\n\n[Interlude]\nIn those days\nThe volunteer fire brigades\nCompeted with each other\nTo be the first to reach the fire\n\n[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]\nBefore a later bay was calm, disreputable hangers on\nWould rumble for the hungry like Montgomery's little Genghis Khans\nWho plain as day would operate in holes where no patrollers go\nGroggeries that host the most ignoble dog and pony show\nFrancis of Assisi in his grave alone to roller-coast\nHis opus now a cove where all the lowest lows can grow and grow\nWith no sign of a holy ghost\nMore the polar: horns and rosy cloven toes\nBunny-hop claims, fold and overthrow\nGangland anchors hit the harbor down for hangman\nShuffle fifty two and slip the chew behind the fang-span\nGreenhorn, he just wanna help his hammers harmonize\nStowed in hell's cargo by the spark in those Wells Fargo eyes\nAnd famine wasn't featured in the pamphlet, neither were the cancers\nCamp was smoking chimney, mantle, taxidermy antlers\nNow the sourdough is lifted out the honeycombs of kitchens\nSatan out on Broadway and Pacific blowing kisses\n\n[Hook] x2\n\n[Verse 3: Aesop Rock]\n40 winks, pissy at the grizzly, no lullaby\nClark's point trollops off the docks to flood and multiply\nUntil a brilliant golden motherlode in the bank\nHold up your drink\nShe said between her legs that other gold's pink\nSold it for cheap along the waterfront, wretched little clusters\nPush a fuss of smutty huffing plus some itching and discomfort\nLittle wonder you, in public for the buck, it's rugged\nRusty cutter gut any cutty drunkard who want it\nHellcat Maggie, aggie, move to the music\nShe had learned to spoon pollution in a climate pruned for losing\nThousand more like her in the cow-yards moo-ing, ooh-ee\nBeneath the brutal harvest moon and UV\nNote it's the very same foundation on which you and yours sleep\nLayers of players over debaucherous troubadour speak\nThey puff the pathogens and never let the humidors breathe\nThat's why you grew up on stale tobacco and juniper trees", "title": "Tomorrow Morning", "album": "Ghosts of the Barbary Coast", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6d5f8f9c5e316e2d4c367b074be99d7e.360x360x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
