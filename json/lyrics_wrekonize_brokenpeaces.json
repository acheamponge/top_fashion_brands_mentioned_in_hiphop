Down these streets chasing dreams I\u2019m not quite sure I can reach\n\n[Verse 2: Wrekonize]\nGot a message from the afterlife, my relatives are well\nI replied that I need heavens help\nThis hemisphere is hell\nI coughed into this cradle later hoping it would swell\nBut a line on the equators only parallel to twelve\nYou go get your disciples, I be getting mine as well\nBut mine don\u2019t bow to hanging hats what some would William Tell\nI walk around this rock till I\u2019m out of schemes to sell\nAnd follow every rising sun until the day is fell\n\nHook:\nI found my peace, let me be or take my breath away from me.
