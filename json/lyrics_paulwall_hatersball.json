Pahtna, what that do?\nStay true to the game, don't fall for the bait\nAnd when they swerve, Imma be straight\nGet the cake, let them hate\n\n[Chorus]\nAll the haters hate, every time I shine\nI'm like why they mad at me, cause I'm on my grind\nBut I'm here to tell you, you can do it too\nBut if you're always roaching, I can't fool with you", "year": "2018-01-19"}]}
