Ayy, who am I? (Yeah)\n\n[Hook]\nThings change, rearrange and so do I It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie I get high \u2019cause the lows can be so cold I might bend a little\nBit but I don't fold\nOne time for my mind and two for yours\nI got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul If you see my tears fall just let me be Move along, nothing to see\n\n[Verse 2]\nI always did shit the hard way My nigga Squirrel slangin' in the hallway Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway Times Square\nKept the dimes there in the locker Some Reggie Miller With more brown hairs than Chewbacca\nWhispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?\nHe tell his pops he need some lunch And he gon' get it right back\nI peep game Got home snatched my mama keychain Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'\nHis mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed And talked about how we gon' smash all the\nBitches in class I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash And just asked, \"What a nigga gotta do to get that? Put me on,\" he just laughed\nWhen he seen I was sure 17 years breathing his demeanor said more He told me, \"Nigga, you know how you sound right now? If you wasn't my mans I would think\nThat you a clown right now Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?\nYou bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices: Either graduate to weight or selling number two For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?\nDo you think that you would know what to do if you was me? I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us If they ain't want us why the fuck they\nNever wore rubbers?\"\nI felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear And thought about how far we done came From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the\nSky\nThank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't\nGon' take what they handed Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me And show you that I can fly\nAnd show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive Ayy, who am I?\n\n[Hook]\nThings change, rearrange and so do I (Ayy, who am I?) It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie (Who am I?) I get high 'cause the lows can be so\nCold I might bend a little bit but I don't fold\nOne time for my mind and two for yours\nI got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul If you see my tears fall just let me be Move along, nothing to see\n\n[Outro]\nI never felt better"}], "artist": "J.
