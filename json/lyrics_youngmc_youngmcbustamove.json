Hey, bust a move\n\n[Chorus]\nYou want it\nYou got it\nYou want it\nBaby you got it (Just bust a move)\nYou want it\nYou got it\nYou want it\nBaby you got it, yeah\n\n[Verse 3]\nIn the city, ladies look pretty\nGuys tell jokes so they can seem witty\nTell a funny joke just to get some play\nThen you try to make a move and she says, \"No way\"\nGirls are fakin', goodness sakin'\nThey want a man who brings home the bacon\nGot no money and you got no car\nThen you got no woman and there you are\nSome girls are sadistic, materialistic\nLookin' for a man makes them opportunistic\nThey're lyin' on the beach perpetrating a tan\nSo that a brother with money can be their man\nSo on the beach you're strollin', real high rollin'\nEverything you have is yours and not stolen\nA girl runs up with somethin' to prove\nSo don't just stand there, bust a move\n\n[Chorus]\nYou want it\nYou got it\nYou want it\nBaby you got it (Just bust a move)\nYou want it\nYou got it\nYou want it\nBaby you got it\n\n[Interlude]\nBreak it down for me fellas\n\n[Verse 4]\nYour best friend Harry, has a brother Larry\nIn five days from now he's gonna marry\nHe's hopin' you can make it there if you can\nCause in the ceremony you'll be the best man\nYou say, \"neat-o\", check your libido\nAnd roll to the church in your new tuxedo\nThe bride walks down just to start the wedding\nAnd there's one more girl you won't be getting\nSo you start thinkin' then you start blinking\nA bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking\nShe thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back\nAnd now your feelin' really firm cause the girl is stacked\nReception's jumpin', faces pumpin'\nLook at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'\nSays she wanna dance to a different groove\nNow you know what to do, so you bust a move\n\n[Chorus]\nYou want it\nYou got it\nYou want it\nBaby you got it (Just bust a move)\nYou want it\nYou got it\nYou want it\nBaby you got it (move it boy)\nYeah", "album": null, "year": "1989-05-22", "image": "https://images.genius.com/038529dc16c13b795320436dc4e3d212.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young MC"}
