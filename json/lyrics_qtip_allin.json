Niggas be on the mic, they be all serious...\nIt's good to be serious but... effortless shit\nEffortless... effa-efortless. Mmm-hmm\nTurn my music up, Duro. Yo, yo, you my hero\nMake the shit get louder. Even more in my headphones. Louder\nUh. Sweetheart, shake yo' ass cheeks\nBust it. Mmm-hmmm. Mmm-hmmm.\"\n\nWe gon' knock it down and put this\nRock solid Amplified shit up\nIt hurts like a sit-up\nSo you betta send a letta to the betta\nWe cut the bank and takin' all the bankin' chedda\nGirls get pretty-ed up\nThen they comin' out the club. Rap cats, lock it up\nWorldwide vision where\nEverybody sees clear\nI could get you ten here\nUh. Makes no fuss. Keep my shit plush\nCompliment, I get blushed. That's just how a brotha is\nBig Willy kids and we really run our jibs\nLadies, breathe easy. Let your man please thee\nUh. Takin' rhymes to another zone\nIs your mother home? Cause we can get the moans\nAnd stay strickly on a rhythmic notion, and\nKeep the joint close for the commotion and\nKeep movin' around. Movie stars\nBuy a little car, buy out the bar\n\n[Q-Tip (Meda Leacock)]\n(\"All in...\") ...for the people who move wit' me\n(\"All in...\") ...for the nights of ecstasy\n(\"All in...\") ...for the way we work and play, doin' it\nEveryday. This is how I need to be\n(\"All in...\") ...for the people who roll wit' me\n(\"All in...\") ...for the nights of ecstasy\n(\"All in...\") ...for the people who work and play, doin' it\nEveryday. This is how I need to be\n\n[Q-Tip]\n\"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, what?\"\nWe do it alive, blowin' the spot of this\nShowin' to prove what rap is. (\"What is it?\")\nMarauder, pass the blue moon\nHit 'chu wit' the ill tune\nAss cheeks move wit' the help of my jacket bloom\nInsert the veteran\nWho consecutively come wit' shit yet again\nOn the dance floor, chicks get horny\nHopin' that they all move on me\nWord, for REAL for real\nDo it hard for the love of the game\nPull your card and I'm askin' yo' name, bitch\nJay-Dee be champion\nTip be stylin' and definin' yo' chick, best compan-ion\nI'd advise you to fix your self, for real\nAnd do your shit wit' more zeal. (\"More zeal.\")\nWe in the mix and it's thickenin'\nMy rhyme and it's tickin' in\nThe hatin' and the shit is so sickenin'\nPicasso, original. (\"'Riginal.\")\nYou forg-azy and the shit amaze me\nSharpen your contrast and put a little color in it\nHigh Define your screen and put this brotha in it\n\n[Q-Tip (Meda Leacock)]\n(\"All in...\") ...for the people who move wit' me\n(\"All in...\") ...for the nights of ecstasy\n(\"All in...\") ...for the way we work and play, doin' it\nEveryday.
