Kennedy\nThis to the cats that [?] on my gang\nPut dirt on my name\nBut I don't blame, I'd probably would do the same\nThe style come natural like [?]\nThis my third album, man, that other shit freestyle\nThe dopest that you've heard thus far\nAnd I don't buy out the bar, I got a half a gallon tucked in the car\nThey treat me like a star, and I ain't even much rich\nAnd had over a thousand cars but nothin' to show for the shit\nI burn zips of the light fine pine\nAnd fightin' for my glamor 'cause you know I gotta shine\nThe only thing on my mind is strategizin' how to get this dough\nI don't care if it take 'til 2004\n\n[Chorus]\nI went from yadadamean to yadada-I'm sayin'\nTo yadada-I'm talkin' 'bout (I know what you talkin' 'bout)\nI went from yadadamean to yadada-I'm sayin'\nTo yadada-I'm talkin' 'bout (I know what you talkin' 'bout)\nI went from yadadamean to yadada-I'm sayin'\nTo yadada-I'm talkin' 'bout (I know what you talkin' 'bout)\nI went from yadadamean to yadada-I'm sayin'\nTo yadada-I'm talkin' 'bout (I know what you talkin' 'bout)"}], "artist": "Keak da Sneak"}
