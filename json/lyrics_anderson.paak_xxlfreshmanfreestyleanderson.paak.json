Just open your eyes\nThis is life as you know it\nA few make it through, most won't survive\nA penny with a hole with no hope inside\nIt's survival of the finesse\nAnd my nigga's went to dinners\nSo we taking a bite\nAnd I made up my mind\nThe whole world loves you when you're top of the line\nThe hoes gon' want you when you're thuggin' it right\nBut the feds gon' bust you if your money too husky man\nTrust me, devils want you livin' in fright\nAin't that right?"}]}
