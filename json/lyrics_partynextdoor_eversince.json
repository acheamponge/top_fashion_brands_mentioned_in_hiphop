You wanna be friends now?\nI do yeah, but like [?]\n\n[Hook]\nEver since a youngin' I been cool around the block\nI just keep mindin' my own business and work with what I got\n? gave me bout a hundred and I took it out the knot\nSeems like when I got rich everybody wanna be friends\nEver since a youngin' I been cool around the block\nI just keep mindin' my own business and work with what I got\n? gave me bout a hundred and I took it out the knot\nSeems like when I got rich everybody wanna be friends\n\n[Bridge]\nCartier frames like Jodeci\nI'm just tryna stay super lowkey\nOnly gang spooky is the police\nNiggas out here watching me like police\n\n[Verse 1]\nI don't give a fuck that bitch unlucky\nYou take her out, I only give that bitch good dick\nYou gave her ten, and I only gave her a good sex\nBitch your red bottoms old, I can't see the red no more\nIf I don't throw up these bands, you can't pay rent no more\nHow you eat that trash? But your stomach flat\nThey can't teach you that in no yoga class\nIts yo mama bih ?\nOut the porsche, but dont do politics\n\n[Hook]\nEver since a youngin' I been cool around the block\nI just keep mindin' my own business and work with what I got\n? gave me bout a hundred and I took it out the knot\nSeems like when I got rich everybody wanna be friends\nEver since a youngin' I been cool around the block\nI just keep mindin' my own business and work with what I got\n? gave me bout a hundred and I took it out the knot\nSeems like when I got rich everybody wanna be friends\n\n[Bridge]\nCartier frames like Jodeci\nI'm just tryna stay super lowkey\nOnly gang spooky is the police\nNiggas out here watching me like police\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo many red dots, its like a tampax\nIf you can take my bih, then nigga you can have that\nSo many cars ?\nSo many strippers in the range ran out of Buckles\nWhip it up the hills if the glove don't fit\nSay a prayer, hope this bitch is clean, hope this bitch is clean\nShe say she been stripping ever since she seventeen\nShe been ? but only wants to rock supreme\nWe making money over here baby, wanna join the team\n?\nThen I dip off in the ghost, like it was just a dream\nRolling on the stone, and her name is Rossetta\nWatch all the rats hate, when you start making some cheddar\nYou won the first 48 snitching on your brothers\nI can't pretend nigga don't play your hand, you just might just think we friends now\n\n[Hook]\nEver since a youngin' I been cool around the block\nI just keep mindin' my own business and work with what I got\n? gave me bout a hundred and I took it out the knot\nSeems like when I got rich everybody wanna be friends\nEver since a youngin' I been cool around the block\nI just keep mindin' my own business and work with what I got\n? gave me bout a hundred and I took it out the knot\nSeems like when I got rich everybody wanna be friends\n\n[Bridge]\nCartier frames like Jodeci\nI'm just tryna stay super lowkey\nOnly gang spooky is the police\nNiggas out here watching me like police", "year": "2019-02-14"}]}
