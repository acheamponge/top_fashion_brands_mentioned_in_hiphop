(You ain't bout it!), I live it (I live it!)\nThat shit (That shit!), I'm with it (I'm with it!)\nThat work (That work!), I flip it (I flip it!)\nThat money (That money!), I get it\nWhat you know about this game, I'm in it (I'm in it!)\nThat hammer (That hammer!), I grip it (I grip it!)\nThat Swisher (That Swisher!), I split it (I split it!)\nA fuck (A fuck!), I don't give it\n\n[Verse 2: A R Deville]\nThe marksman, the target, the grand design\nThe struggle, the hustle, the process, the demand to shine\nThe hunger to be in front, the patience to stand in line\nThe vision of listening in hopes it will advance my grind\nThe movement, the blueprint, the street science\nThe weak dying, we keep iron, the street giants\nThe focus, the understanding\nThe greed, the need to supply what they're demanding\nThe harsh realities of life\nThe thought of reincarnation, I seen it all twice\nOn my third time around, touching down where them killers be\nDisplay a couple of bananas, make sure the opposition see\nI'm magnificent, I'm magnifi-cents\nNiggas hollering, I won't even acknowledge it\nBasking in the finer shit, you know, that designer shit\nNo stranger to hard work, I'm up early when it's time to grip\n\n[Hook]"}]}
