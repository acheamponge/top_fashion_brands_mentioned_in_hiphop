It's me, Hoseok\nWe\u2019ve been together 7 years, including our trainee days\nWhen I was first at the dorm, I felt so awkward and shy\nSo I remained in the living room\nThen you came over to talk and made me relax\nI still can't forget that moment\nComing from Gwangju, you were like my savior\nWhen I was sick or sad, you were there by me\nWhen I was tired and had it hard, you were there to give me strength\nWhen I got seasick on Bon Voyage 2 and opened my eyes from sleep, the first person I saw was you - though Jimin was also there\nI didn't say it then, but I really appreciated your help\nAs much as we\u2019ve spent time together, I'm that much grateful to you\nI'd like to say that with this letter at this time\nThanks for becoming a member of BTS\nAnd thanks for being my big brother\nI hope you're always by my side"}], "artist": "\u200bj-hope"}
