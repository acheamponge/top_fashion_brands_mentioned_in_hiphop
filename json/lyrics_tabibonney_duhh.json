I'm one of them. Wale, what up?\nGucci sneaks on my feet\n*Bunay round waist hurt label feet*\nObviously I sleep around\nI'mma stay a swinger 'til my feet hit the ground\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Samples]\nWe know you got soul, so you know you gotta lace it\n*We know you wear your hair but* hit em hard with the Basics\nWe told them fluke dudes to get off that gay shit\nGet off, get off, get off, get off, get off, back\nGet off, my, my, my, my my back\n\n[Outro: Tabi Bonney]\nI'd like to give a shout out to, uh, Biz Markie, Salt-N-Pepa, MC Lite, Run DMC, Eric B. & Rakim, EPMD, Special Ed, Big Daddy Kane.
