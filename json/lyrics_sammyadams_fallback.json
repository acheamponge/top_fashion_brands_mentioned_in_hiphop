New Sammy track\nNever run away but it's cool fall back\nAlways been cool so the fame just adds to the fact that we got the whole room so packed\nWe good we don't need no cause\nThe team likes being in the city so we don't see no stars\nWhattup haters i'm back so how's my dick taste\nStill good? K cool get it all back\n\n\nHarder than ever my balls sharper than cheddar\nSmell like tobacco and leather\nThanks Tom nobody's better than that\nSpas I don't need medication\nYou hear it the dedication\nRefuse to take a vacation (fallback)\nI'm on the cover like bitches that I fuckin got\nEnrique doing doubles like I'm a fucking drug I don't crack\nI'm a no brainer I'm a fucking entertainer\nI'm just bringin the focus like some mad mother fuckers", "album": null}], "artist": "Sammy Adams"}
