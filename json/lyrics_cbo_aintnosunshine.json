Hell nah\nI refuse to loose respect, break necks\nTo get mines big niggas get checked\nAnd it don't matter who ya are\nCause once you're dead and gone, lfacin' up at stars\nIt Ain't No Sunsine\n\nChorus (X2)\n\nAin't no sunshine, Ain't no sunshine\nAin't no sunshine, when ya gone\n\n[Verse 2]\nI keep my mind on survivin', one in the chamber\nMy pistol when I'm ridin'\nOne-times want me dead, the judge wants me strapless\nPraying that I'm next to get stuck up on a jack-list\nThey got me guilty until proven innocent\nCracked my juvenile files, want me washed up the Nile\nSo-called homies turned on me, and tattled\nHad me rattled when I heard the feds was in Seattle\nPunk bitch snitches die suckin' on a dick\nWrapped in plastic, floating with they throats slit\nStraight razor ear-to-ear nosey ones get stitch scars\nWatch the homies hit that ass cause on the yard It Ain't No Sunshine\n\nChorus (X2)\n\nAin't no sunshine, Ain't no sunshine\nAin't no sunshine, when ya gone\n\n[Verse 3]\nSee, some think their bad cause they bigger\nSucka-ass nigga caught a slug in the liver\nLayin' on the concrete bleedin out the kidney\nFuckin with a young G, got buck quickly\nDropped the gat in his drawers, gave up his set\nSpit a loogie on his chest showing no regret\nA murder-man, killa, mad at the world\nNatural born, jackin bitches for diamonds and pearls\nCome bangin' on my door, 15's stacked\nI answered with the Mac cause im sittin' on Yac\nSee I'm a G from the hood the BG's idol\nI front them caine on the spot cause money is survival\nHe says whatsup big homie, give a nigga daps\nAnd put that (???) under the door as I gets the sack\nI'm on my toes so be hold on that bergalin'\nCause ain't no sunshine for murder-men\n\n[Verse 4: Tuna Bug]\nIt's the loc dog psycho, so go for your gun\nCause Im'a go for mine and be a nigga on the run\nSo that shotgun splatters, eatin' up yo shit\nThe loom-loon-loom got your windshield in your face, bitch\nYou can't fuck with a criminal\nI fill your shit with holes then send your ass to your funeral\nThen who knows, the getaway scheme\nBack three's through the G to my house in the tree\nI'm livin low, but most of it's high\nCotton mouth the most I think I'll blame it on the buddah thai\nAnd that's why, I live off the gat\nWhy throw it away? with or without it they gon' watch my ass\nCause it's my first strike so a nigga go for blood\nSo when it's on, it's me or the fuzz\nI'm stuck in the slum and bound to get mine\nWith one life to live, it Ain't No Sunshine\n\nChorus"}]}
