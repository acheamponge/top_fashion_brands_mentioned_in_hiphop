than you, I'm better than you, uhh uhh\nSamuel Adams\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nI\u2019m better than you\nI\u2019m better than who?\nI\u2019m better than you\nYup better than you and your whole crew\nThat\u2019s true, that dude rockin\u2019 some black shoes\nOr a pair of Jordan\u2019s you ain't never seen around you\nWho cares\nLike my belongings are so appalling\nBut listen to my story its short yet it\u2019s alarming\nI went from no shows to hoes calling my charming\nUnbuttoning my pants searching without a warrant\nAnd I can't stop can\u2019t catch me\nYou can\u2019t even break me running harder than an athlete\nGirls sitting up on my lap mistake this for a track meet\nI\u2019m just X5\u2019in, highway, pass me\nWith black rims and give your crew the business\nStay catchin up brains like I\u2019m in Harvard on the crimson\nConfidence is honesty and modest is my mission\nJuggling a 3.3, my GPA\u2019s Pippen (scholar)\nO I get it, nope I don\u2019t need your details\nTalents over your head manager\u2019s don\u2019t want your emails\nI\u2019m better than you and when it\u2019s said and done right\nI\u2019m be like I told you so and dammit ima love life\nI\u2019m better than you\nI\u2019m better than who?\nI\u2019m better than you\nYup better than you and your whole crew\nThat\u2019s true, that dude rockin\u2019 some black shoes\nOr a pair of Jordan\u2019s you ain't never seen around you\nStop the show the crowd dome\u2019s getting blown back\nCause the headliner ain\u2019t half as nice as the opening act (Wiz)\nThey want an encore yup they wanna send me back\nSkinny is the new success you my dude at getting phat\nAnd I don\u2019t care if you got fans that can sing along\nIt\u2019s easy to steal hooks and then go make a song\nBut I\u2019m shameless too nice and I\u2019ll be famous\nBut I guess it\u2019s proven that two rights can\u2019t make a wrong\nAnd all the pressure one man can\u2019t take it all\nBut I bring them white caps when the fuckin ocean come\nAnd the way I been treated ya I got hella qualms\nSee I'm the best but they won't see the truth til later on\nLike Mr. Adams can\u2019t kick out with a blindfold\nCovering\u2019 both eye holes\nTell me something\u2019 I don\u2019t know know know\nI just wonder where the time goes\nMusic is my brain and I\u2019m just tryin to get my mind blown\nI\u2019m better than you\nI\u2019m better than who?\nI\u2019m better than you\nYup better than you and your whole crew\nThat\u2019s true, that dude rockin\u2019 some black shoes\nOr a pair of Jordan\u2019s you ain't never seen around you\nI'm gon\u2019 shine stupid\nDis and yes it\u2019s Sammy Adams\nMy boys in the cabin puffin Lucky sippin madness\nSo come fly with me\nCruise or drive wish you had it\nHeard my shit when I was Wiz\nJust signed out at you\u2019re my dick\nUh Huh I\u2019m better than who?\nI\u2019m better than you, I'm better than you, uhh uhh\nSamuel Adams\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nI\u2019m better than you\nI\u2019m better
