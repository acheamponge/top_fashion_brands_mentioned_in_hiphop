{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]\nBig willy, I'm fuckin' whores\nSince a youngin' grabbed the pistol, skipped the chores\nHit the weed and said \"It's on\"\nGot with my older Loc's they threw your boy a zone\nBefore my mom could smell the scent that shit was gone\nMovin' on to bigger things now, don't call my phone\nCarry chrome, I think them boys after me\nBut I shoot fast like athletes\nNumber one Magic flipper, I'm Anfernee\nOops, threw a couple at your coupe\nMr. Hard-top, don't fuckin' lose your roof\nSmashin' on a 110\nEmpty most of the clip, shit only got one sin\nWhere's Waldo at? Put this bitch to his lens\nGot the dimes all wrapped, on his block like you're still friends\nStill low from the po-po, no L's in the Volvo\nMask on catch a photo when my glove's wrapped around the 4-4\n\n[Verse 2: Action Bronson]\nCaught a statuatory rape cause the steak wasn't mature\nI'm laid out by the lake, you lay with inflatable mates\nI lace my shoes tight and ready for the paper chase\nI like my girls with African bodies and Asian face\nOnly green M&M's placed in my dressing room\nPineapple juice, roast turkey\nIf I want, I got a bitch to suck a thirty dick circle\nThen hop up in a cab, this just to serve a bitch purple\nCome back, make rice for the fellas\nEvery single person rockin' leather\nCheddar attatched, my mental is hatched from the medicine cabinet\nRock a shirt, got the pattern of the wilderness habitat\nI make kids, NFL ready\nYours are 23 wearin' bibs slurping spaghetti\nYour family cancer took her tits off\nDon't even look us in the eye\nSpit the shit to make a lesbian cry, dyke", "title": "Demolition Man", "album": "Rare Chandeliers ", "image": "https://images.genius.com/20bdbefccfb30aac00800f75ffc6462d.507x507x1.jpg", "year": "2012-11-15"}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
