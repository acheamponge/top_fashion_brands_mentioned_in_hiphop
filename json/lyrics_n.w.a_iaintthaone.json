I'm thinking Burger King\nAnd when I take you, you get frustrated\nYou can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it\nBut you see, I don't go nuts\nOver girls like you with the BIG ol' butts\nIt start comin out the pocket, to knock it\nBut when the damage is done\nYou can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl\nFor the simple fact that, I ain't the one\nI don't care how they look if they got money\nWe can hook up but they ain't gettin' none\nYeah, I just make 'em think they gonna get some\nPlay up they mind a lil' bit, and get that money\nOh Ice Cube, can I have some money please\nGive you money why bother\nCause you know I'm lookin' nothin' like your father\nGirl, I can't be played or ganked\nGanked means getting took for your bank\nOr your gold or your money or something\nNine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing\nThey get mad when I put it in perspective\nBut let's see if my knowledge is effective\nTo the brothas man they robbing you blind\n'Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind\nKeep your money to yourself homie and if you got enough game\nYou'll get her name and her number without going under\nYou can't leave 'em and love 'em and stay above 'em\nI used to get no play now she stay behind me\n'Cause I said I had a Benz 190 but I lied and played the one\nJust to get some now she feels dumb to my homies it's funny\nBut that's what you get trying to play me for my money\nNow don't you feel used\nBut I don't give hoot, huh, because I knock boots\nYou shouldn't be, so damn material\nAnd try to milk Ice Cube like cereal\nNow how many times do I have to say it\n'Cause if I have to go get a gun, you girls will learn I don't burn\nYou think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one\nBut you said, you love me\nI don't see no rings on this finger\nWhy you doin' me like this? I love you\nYeah, you love my money, I got what I wanted, beat it", "album": null, "year": null, "title": "I Ain\u2019t Tha One", "image": "https://images.genius.com/627acab300f5f3fd378a3b1adf4a69f8.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "N.W.A"}
