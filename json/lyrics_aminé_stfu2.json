I can hear you chokin' on my tenacious dick everytime your dumb ass talks shit about me. Like I said before, bitch, you're not shit, you're never gon' be shit, and you're just a piece of shit. So shut the fuck up!\n\n[Verse]\n(Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up)\nTwo milly in my hand, two milly for a jam\nThat's four milly in the can, the size of Pac's caravan\nMy wingspan 7 foot, right hand get a hook\nHit a lick then leave him shook, treat him just like police would\nMask on, niggas hard, mask off, niggas soft\nGenius like I'm Steve Jobs, greedy like I'm Steve Jobs\nOkay, you really wanna test me today\nOkay, I hit em like I'm Bobby Boucher\nThey see me rollin' now, I'm tryna make a million\nI got a new bitch, like I'm Ben Simmons\nMy ego big as Shaq, rockin' like Fu-Schnickens\nPut it in her Ariana, like I'm Mariah's children\nI smell the snake on the scene\nFor heaven's sake let him breathe\nPussy niggas talk shit like they really the man\nAnd when we actually pull up you best don't front on 'em, man\n\n[Chorus]\n(Shut the fuck up) and why you whinin'?\n(Shut the fuck up) aye, stop cryin'\nKeep frontin' on my niggas, keep stylin'\nIf you sendin' threats then my niggas gon' find 'em\n(Shut the fuck up) and why you whinin'?\n(Shut the fuck up) aye, stop cryin'\nKeep frontin' on my niggas, keep stylin'\nIf you sendin' threats then my niggas gon' find 'em"}]}
