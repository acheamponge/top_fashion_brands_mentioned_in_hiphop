{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Aesop Rock]\nTake-take the medicine, tastes great\nGot the key to the city, I\u2019m wake-baked\nWay before the media shitting or 12 zip of ganked paint\nThe origin of a thievery leader will take place\nTwo coke bottles adorn the rogue toddler\nGrapple a refrigerator, gaffle a Nilla Wafer\nAnd no role model provoke him to shift focus\nCause he noticed that a cookie tastes better when it's stolen\nKids got the darnedest quirks\nSo 11's arms skip jars for his momma's purse\nAnd bought enough fireworks from the bullies to blow up a small barn\nWhich he kept in a box in the yard\nAnd the bark isn't carved from a klepto-anthem\nBut a klepto-tangent prefaced the grand canvas\nDance to the dirge, stand up\nCelebrate the natural need to own what ain't earned\nSee it rolls off the tongue\nLike a smoke ring rolls off a lung 'til it's done\nReady, set, kept petty theft on a post-it\nLater apply the motives to a moment on some grown shit\n\"Hey, you with the sharpie and BM!\"\nDid you foreplay the GM, or you carpe the diem?\nWhore play the porn game, fornicate the sure way to freedom\nOr correlate with the swordplay and heathens?\nTrickery and backtalk, fresh outta high school\nOn the prickly catwalk of the modern grind slide rule\nEvery last number in its history\nGot is own little hustle to nuzzle up with the victory\nThanks, bathe in a bottle of your finest\nTackleberry sift through the piss looking for diamonds\nBefore the hell appears to put the chemi in the climate\nGet your money from the richest, get your pussy from the flyest\n\nSlow and low, do or die calm, suicide king in the tuck of the palm\nSlow and low, do or die stuck, two to five cans in the tuck of the trunk\nAnd these are the five fingers that are stealing from you\nAnd these are the five fingers that are stealing from you\nAnd these are the five fingers that are stealing from you...\n(Capture the flag)\n(Capture the flag)\n(Capture the flag)\n\nOne by one like little confused penguins\nLarceny's yes-men ooze for used weapons\nLike a bitter little burglar jaded up out the bucket seat\nIs dumb enough to feel like the public owe him a fucking thing\nNope, gotta configure the five finger\nSo the hot-wired vehicular skill is applicable\nIf an eye's on the prize and the itch ain't flushed\nI hope the fruits of your labor outlive the initial rush, like\nStep on the abysmal cusp\nWith matchmakers trying to make the mixed signals fuck\nThen incubate the mutt baby through his stigma's crutch\nLike he will learn to walk after he lifts the drums\nAnd this is certified milk by the New York Department of Skullduggery\nShoplift quicker than your shutter speed, click!\nMissed, he dipped with dumb cutlery\nIn and out of muddy river water 'til the rudder bleed\nSkip around the money pillar, color me bunny killer\nHovering where the mother feed, gutter greed king\nAnd a crummy motherfucker breed fuck with me\nIt go knock knock rummy at a bruckner speed\nThe seed's all growns up playing grown people games\nEvil aims grown, encompass the whole steeple chase\nGrip, mitigate the master plan\nSo when the workers are asleep, riffraff expands\nYes a pig is a cop, but gotta fill up the flock\nSo when I rake in the bacon I hope the kiddies'll watch\nI hope the flipping of the system will be heavily clocked\nCause opportunity's fickle, after it trickle it stop\nCapture the flag, drag that crass little bastard\nFlat through the hazmat and glass\nLaugh when he ask for it back; scratch that:\nWelcome to the magic in a basket of cash\n\nSlow and low, do or die calm, suicide king in the tuck of the palm\nSlow and low, do or die stuck, two to five cans in the tuck of the trunk\nAnd these are the five fingers that are stealing from you\nAnd these are the five fingers that are stealing from you\nAnd these are the five fingers that are stealing from you...\n(Capture the flag)\n(Capture the flag)\n(Capture the flag)\n(Capture the flag)\n(Cap-cap-capture the flag)\n\n(*scratches'n'cuts*)", "title": "Five Fingers", "album": "None Shall Pass", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3d6c4d11084714cc67f880d71310d197.288x288x1.jpg", "year": "2007-08-28"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
