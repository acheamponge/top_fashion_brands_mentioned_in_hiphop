living in some times that\u2019s the craziest\nThey say these legislators are the laziest\nDedicated religious figures have gone atheist\nEach and every thing must change, there\u2019s no escaping this\nI\u2019m on the block, post-apocalyptic smoke covers\nCoincidentally presented by the Koch Brothers\nThe magnitude of this is bigger than the both of us\nThe attitude is trying to manage not to choke from it\nGo and get the bolt cutters\nOpen the floodgate\nAny relationship I\u2019ve ever been in was love-hate\nThe city I was living in really never was safe\nFor some, a temporary resolution was duct tape\nNow I\u2019mma probably be on the black list\nBut I don\u2019t give a fuck, so I\u2019m gonna shrug like Atlas\nAnd if my skepticism was a brand new practice\nWould y\u2019all be disappointed like y\u2019all just got catfished?\nIt\u2019s cold blooded\nI\u2019m wholeheartedly cold-hearted and swole from it\nThe same unseen hand is still in control of it\nI should be mining my own, like it\u2019s a gold nugget\nBut I\u2019m on that same bullshit, just on a lower budget\nWaiting on change that been low\n\u2018Til the day after tomorrow\nI sit by the window\nIn a police state, like your man Michael Winslow\nMy kinfolk told me there\u2019s a brand new Jim Crow\nI been going to bed at 10, up at 5\nHustling to the bus and ride to the job\nIt\u2019s feeling hot as the Fourth of July\nMy lady just getting home, we leading separate lives\nShe couldn\u2019t be one of those Stepford Wives if she tried\nThey shot my cousin, he died\nIt wasn\u2019t justified\nI guess I\u2019ll see him if I make it to the other side\nThe corner deli owner tell me \u2018hurry up and buy\u2019\nEverybody is somebody, tell me \u2014 who am I?\nThe same figure who came from Anguilla\nAin\u2019t nothing different, I think I\u2019m addicted to pain-killer\nI\u2019m un-permitted to enter the village of Shangri-La\nI\u2019m depicted as bein\u2019 a killer that\u2019s dangerous, huh?\nHalf dozen in one hand, six in the other\nYo, this is more than a sun tan, it\u2019s living color\nBlack as oblivion, black as obsidian\nBlack as the sky at midnight ante meridian\nI am black as a portrait with Diddy, 2Pac, and Biggie in\nBlack as the influence on the culture we living in\nI survived the chitterling circuit, vaudeville and then\nManaged to inspire The Beatles, and Bob Dyl\u2019 and them\nBut did I miss the mark cause I\u2019m just as dark\nAs John Henrik Clarke\u2019s inner thoughts\nAt the time of the Harlem Renaissance?\nAfter which, rights activists deviated the flight path\nTo Black ratchetness, putting us back, smack dab\nWhen night catches us\nWe just go along for the ride: passengers\nGluttons for punishment: masochists\nStill doing whatever master asks of us\nWill this generation go down as the last of us?\nWhere being young men-while-black was hazardous?\nEnter the proverbial masked avenger\nAll these pretenders suffer from symptoms of Affluenza\nI\u2019m just thinking aloud about extinction agendas and plans\nMy grandmother definitely remembers\nListen, her suits were tailor-made\nSundays, Mahalia played\nSimple familiar ways\nLike the way she knelt and prayed, wailing\n\"Lord master, forgive us our trespasses,\" had us real afraid\nI never listened, but I still obeyed\nI got to see how gangstas played at such an early age\nWhat my father was into sent him to his early grave\nThen mom started chasing that base like Willie Mays\nMy childhood was all of 40 nights and 40 days\nTrouble was my ball and chain\nShorties would call me names\nHumble beginnings, Black Thought is what that all became\nMy journey from a dirty hallway to the hall of fame\nMusic, my therapeutic way to deal with all this pain\nI was headed for the drain\nSoaking, before the rainwater came\nAnd chaos, that\u2019s when the order came\nI started doing what I\u2019m supposed to do in life\nTrying to move out of the dark, and closer to the light\nThey say when you get a chance to do it over, do it right\nTomorrow isn\u2019t promised every time we say \u2018goodnight\u2019\nListen \u2026 hold up\nDope shot, mug shot, gun shot, jump shot\nTake your pick, but you only got one shot\nAdvice, from a schoolteacher to a young tot\nApplying a sticker to a Spiderman lunchbox\nWhen even role-models tell us we\u2019re born to be felons\nAnd we ain\u2019t getting into Harvard or Carnegie Mellon\nAnd of these other peoples\u2019 blessings, we\u2019re gonna be jealous It\u2019s not fair that that\u2019s all they can tell us\nThat\u2019s why I hustle hella hard, I don\u2019t celebrate a holiday\nThat could be the day a brother could\u2019ve struck the lotter-ay\nI refuse to ever lose or throw my shot away\nOr chalk it up as just another one that got away\nSo, I\u2019m unapologetic\nI\u2019m on my calisthenics\nIf I have given it all I\u2019ve got, I cannot regret it\nMy final destination\u2019s different from where I was headed\nCause I\u2019mma shoot for the stars to get it\nOne shot"}], "artist": "Black Thought"}
