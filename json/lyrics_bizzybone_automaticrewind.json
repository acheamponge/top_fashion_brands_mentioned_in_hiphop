Tonight is our night, you ready?\n[Bizzy: hysterical laugh] Crossroads? Ah-ha!\nThis is where Bone should've been...

(go... go...)\n? that's what we ?\n\nI slip into ya\nGlide yo lips around my rider baby\nYour fingertips and make this trip\nI'm a go inside\nExotic flexin\nYou ain't text'n me\nYou sext'n me and\n?\nYou off the top\nI'm a go behind\n\nPlay that fuckin' music\nLet it automatically rewind\nPanties drop\nSlight shave\nCoochie cleaned\nI'm a pop\nDon't stop\nWon't stop\nBest believe I can do this...\n\nCause I'm a rider baby (baby)\nWhen I'm inside ya baby (baby)\nYa see that fire baby\nSo open up and I'm a ride it all the time...\n\nCause I'm a rider baby (baby)\nWhen I'm inside ya baby (baby)\nYa see that fire baby\nSo open up and I could ride it all the time...\n\nNow I got you screaming oh...\nWhen you're down on you're knees\nIs it joy?
