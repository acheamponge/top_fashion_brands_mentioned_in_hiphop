Writer]\nTo all my hustlers, rock smugglers, strugglers\nBlock bubblers, pushers, cookers, pot jugglers\nWhats the word y'all, flip that herb, raw\nClap, that's the byrd call\nIf the cops are coming, get to hop and running\nQuick and drop that onion, ain't no stopping, young'un\nPut away that herb, raw, let us know the word or\nClap, that's the byrd call\n\n[Verse 1: J.R. Writer]\nI still be where the weed flip, in the P's with the trees lit\nSo much water in the order, it's just leaving them seasick\nWith a ski in my V6, trying to skeet on a b lips\nDown low, like I'm trying to keep her a secret\nAct wrong, chrome, passing me dome\nNext minute -- shit, I'm finished; she'll be flagging it home\nBut I always keep a straggler that's known to bone\nAnd run through a lap faster than Marion Jones\nMan listen, I still got them grams flipping, tan pitching\nCorner to the damn kitchen\nGained a couple fans, had to make a transition\nBut I'm still in the hood like a transmission\nNo cat can match me, I'm passing fastly -- who's half as nasty?\nI got it locked from here all the way to Cak-a-lacky\nBut keep a Mac for Scrappy, thinking its just laffy taffy\nShit, this beat'll be the only thing clapping at me\n\n[Hook: J.R. Writer]\nTo all my hustlers, rock smugglers, strugglers\nBlock bubblers, pushers, cookers, pot jugglers\nWhats the word y'all, flip that herb, raw\nClap, that's the byrd call\nIf the cops are coming, get to hop and running\nQuick and drop that onion, ain't no stopping, young'un\nPut away that herb, raw, let us know the word or\nClap, that's the byrd call\n\n[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]\nBirdman J.R. and J.R., pigeons know who they are\nNiggas gotta pay off, snitches know to say y'all\nIf chickens on the radar, I\u2019m at it\nCause I get it on my day off, ain't nothing like getting weight off\nScrape off the plates, shake off the flakes\nBag that and make all the cake\nI gotta lay off, the way y'all hate me like I\u2019m Adolf\nBut y'all can't see me: Ray Charles\nI steal whores, I\u2019ll probably take yours\nBecause you peel off and I take off\nGive me no space; whatever I want I takes\nWhatever I need I bleed and succeed\nBitch nigga, don\u2019t breathe on the weed\nI\u2019m fucking with them birds without feeding them seeds\nThat\u2019s creed, you don\u2019t know about it\nFull clip how I go about it, full body\nHard body, I\u2019m like \"God got 'im\"\n\n[Hook: J.R.

Writer]\nThis ain't only bars and tracks, this is for the hardest cats\nFlipping all the hard in back, make them catch a heart attack\nWhen you see the narcs attack, let me know\nStart to clap, clap, clap\nA star with a deal, Chopard be on chill\nThe car is DeVille, it's real ill, heart in the grill\nIt's foreign, my nills\nCruise the city with the semi or the celly\nOn skinnies like I'm starving my wheels"}], "artist": "J.R.
