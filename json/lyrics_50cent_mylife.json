The track I lace it, it's better than basic\nThis is my recovery, my comeback, kid\n\n[Hook: Adam Levine]\nMy life, my life\nMakes me wanna run away\nThere's no place to go\nNo place to go\nAll the confusion\nIt's an illusion, like a movie\nGot nowhere to go\nNowhere to run and hide\nNo matter how hard I try\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nWhile you were sippin' your own Kool-Aid gettin' your buzz heavy\nI was in the fucking shed, sharpening my machete\nSippin' on some of that revenge juice, getting my taste buds ready\nTo wolf down this spaghetti\nOr should I say this spa-get-even?\nI think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting\nThought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the beginning\nHe's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', fuck who he's offending!\nHe'll rip your vocal chords out\nAnd have them bitches plugged in the\nMotherfucking wall with 3000 volts of electricity\nNow take the other end of 'em\nThen plug them motherfuckers-in-each one of your eye sockets\n\u2018Cause I thought you might finally fucking see\nThat'll teach you to go voicin' your cocksuckin' opinion to me\nI done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit\nFuck letting up! You\u2019re gonna end up regretting\nYou ever betted against me\nFeels like I'ma snap any minute, yeah, it's happenin' again\nAnd I'm thinking about just saying\n\"Motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch but 50!\"\n\u2018Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go\nI swear to God I put my heart and soul\nIn this more than anybody knows\nI'm trapped, so all I do is rap\nBut everytime I rap I'm more trapped\nAnd I rap myself right to this bubble, oh I guess it's bubble wrap\nIt's like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis\nChrist, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?\nFeels like I'm going psycho again (shh, shh, shh, shh)\nAnd I might just blow my lid\nShit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid\n\u2018Cause I'm runnin' in circles with\u2014\n\n[Hook: Adam Levine]\nMy life, my life\nMakes me wanna run away\nThere's no place to go\nNo place to go\nAll the confusion\nIt's an illusion, like a movie\nGot nowhere to go\nNowhere to run and hide\nNo matter how hard I try\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nI haven't been this fuckin' confused since I was a kid\nSold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did\nMaybe this is for me, maybe\nMaybe I'm supposed to go crazy\nMaybe I'll do it 3AM in the morning like Shady\nPsycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter\nTry to say this ain't classic, get yo' ass kicked mad quick\nWrap your head up in plastic\nPussy, now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots\nIt's tragic, it's sad it's never gonna end\nNow we number one again\nWith that frown on your face and your heart full of hate\nAccept it, respect it, this a gift God-given\nLike the air in the lungs of every fuckin' thing livin'\n\n[Hook: Adam Levine]\nMy life, my life\nMakes me wanna run away\nThere's no place to go\nNo place to go\nAll the confusion\nIt's an illusion, like a movie\nGot nowhere to go\nNowhere to run and hide\nNo matter how hard I try", "year": "2012-11-26"}]}
