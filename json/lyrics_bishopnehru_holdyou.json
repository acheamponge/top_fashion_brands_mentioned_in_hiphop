Tyrese]\nEvery time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)\nTelling me I need you in my life\nEvery time I try to go, something keeps telling me that (me that)\nEverything gon be all right\n\n[Chorus]\nGet a little close, baby I just wanna hold you\nWhy you do the most? Baby you know what I go through\nNo this ain't a joke, I'm just tryna get to know you\nWe can take it slow, you just gotta let me show\nCause you know you always be on my mind\nI think of you all the time\n\n[Verse 1]\nLook, I'm thinking of you often, you know what that results in\nMe overthinking and leaving my mind inside a coffin\nAnd often it's exhausting but you know just who I'm wanting\nSo just quit with all the taunting cause your mind's what I get lost in\nI love it when we talking, meaning me and you\nThem others on the side they kill the vibe when we be in the mood\nAnd yeah I got a lot to prove, really it ain't nothing new\nI'm used to having to show 'em actions that make 'em get the view\nNow you see it and you want it, just believe it\nIf I say it then I mean it, fire burning like a phoenix\nSo we gotta make it work through the anger and the hurt\nCause you know I know the worth and I will never do you dirt\nWhy you staying on alert I've been working for your crown\nAnd your friends think the worst so they tryna slow us down\nI ain't tryna show you hurt, it's the other way around\nLet me see you smile first, I don't wanna see you frown, just\n\n[Chorus]\nGet a little close, baby I just wanna hold you\nWhy you do the most? Baby you know what I go through\nNo this ain't a joke, I'm just tryna get to know you\nWe can take it slow, you just gotta let me show\nCause you know you always be on my mind\nI think of you all the time\n\n[Verse 2]\nI go to sleep and I see you, I'm released from the evils\nAnd these people, we lifting needles tryna see peaceful\nThey say I'm gifted so I'm giving mine for you to keep boo\n[?] cause we need to be seen as regal\nAnd [?] make you a believer\nPlease stand by [?] like Jason [?]\nThey hating when I see ya and waiting for a see ya\nIn my mind we'll be finer when we both seniors\nEither it's here now, I'm clearing your tears now\nStaring into your fears, exhausting ain't around\nOn the real ain't too many things that I need around\nBut what's an emperor without an empress to give a crown\nNow I found what I needed, a piece like me\nAnd we both so conceited but you would never see it\nSo I'ma make you take it, ain't no way that you can leave it\nCause this shit already written, you just gotta sit and read it\n\n[Chorus]\nGet a little close, baby I just wanna hold you\nWhy you do the most? Baby you know what I go through\nNo this ain't a joke, I'm just tryna get to know you\nWe can take it slow, you just gotta let me show\nCause you know you always be on my mind\nI think of you all the time\n\n[Interlude]"}], "artist": "Bishop Nehru"}
