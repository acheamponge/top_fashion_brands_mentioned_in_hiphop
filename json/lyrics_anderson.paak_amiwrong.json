Yeah\n\n[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]\nI'm only comin' out to play\nNothin' more that I hate in this life\nThe wrong impression, I only have one to make\nYou can open your palm, waiting to catch a break\nThe cards will fall where they may\nAnd what about me?\nI believe in fate, huh\nThey wanna know where I'll be in five, huh\nWhat about today? What about tonight?\n\n[Refrain: Anderson .Paak]\nOnly one at a time\nSo precious, it's yours, it's mine\nOnly one at a time\nMy life, my life, yeah\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]\nAm I wrong to assume\nIf she can't dance, then she can't ooh?\nAm I wrong to say\nIf she can't dance, then she can't ooh?\n\n[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]\nHey, I never wanna waste your time, my life\nSo precious, is yours, is mine\nAnd look at the time, my God\nSo precious, is yours, is mine\n\n[Refrain: Anderson .Paak]\nOnly one at a time\nSo precious, it's yours, it's mine\nOnly one at a time\nMy life, my life, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]\nSmiles around the clock\nDance around the globe to Disco 54\nI stare at you in the eyes and spin you on your toes\nMusic ain't music without soul\nFeelin' the top row\nShut the blindfolds, pass the nitro\nRock the love boat, get high or get low\nChill the Merlot, steady your fast pour\nYou pick up, we go low\nMake love once or more, we rest then encore\nDo-do that-that-that, hey\nBreak you off in your Kit-Kat-Kat, hey\nNever seen a one this gorgeous\nPay your whole damn mortgage\nWill you look at the time, hey?\nStill you the one on the mind, hey\nStill you the top of the rhyme, hey\nThank God that it's Friday\nTonight let's be the life of the party\nIt's nothing to me\nGet up and move your feet, ah!\n\n[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]\nI never wanna waste your time, my life\nSo precious, is yours, is mine\nAnd look at the time, my God\nSo precious, is yours, is mine\nI never wanna waste your time, my life\nSo precious, is yours, is mine\nAnd look at the time, my God\nSo precious, is yours, is mine"}]}
