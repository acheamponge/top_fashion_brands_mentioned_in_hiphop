You, blud? No, she is my (baby)\nDon't be clever cause you chirpsed her\nAnd she gave you her number\nShe doesn't like you, she's on a rebound\nShe's just getting that meat, you clown\nYou've had your fun, now piss off, go on\nI don't wanna see your face near the face of my baby\nStay away from my (baby)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/608f6238fbd38a5d0f4fc08b9ab7227c.400x400x1.jpg", "album": "The Creeper Mixtape Volume 1", "title": "Baby Freestyle"}]}
