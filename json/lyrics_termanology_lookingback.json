League]\n\n[Hook: CrushBoys]\nAll alone I stay in my room, waiting for something\nWaiting for someone\nTo bring me out this misery I call home\nBut it's not there problem\nI stare in the mirror\nI'm looking back\nI'm looking back, I'm looking back\n\n[Verse 1]\nSitting in this room, playing on my Nintendo\nStomach rumbling cuz my mother's family been broke\nShe left me with my grandma, she's schizophrenic and mental\nAnd she smoked three packs, and she ain't open up the window\nStruggling with asthma, one room apartment\nRoom full of smoke while grandma talked to the wall\nAnd she would scream at the air\nSo everybody laughed, but I held her by the hand cuz she was all that I had\nAnd this was Lawrence, Mass\nMy toilet seat filled with napkins\nCuz it's only one bathroom to share with the crackheads\nHoles in the mattress, my clothes is disastrous\nHallway smelling like crack and burnt plastic\nEven though this the past, the memories still vivid\nGetting kicked out of school and getting whipped in the kitchen\nAnd none of this is fiction, different or false written\nJust the autobiography of a man on a mission\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nThinking back to 9 years old, I can remember\nFlashbacks of this pimp O, beating my Aunt Heather\nJeans in a small sweater, she would creep thru the hall fed up\nLooking to smoke a rock so she could feel all better\nNow I'm all grown and more hungry than ever\nMore humble and cleaver\nIt's all coming together\nBeen thru the storm weather\nConsistent by all measures, but sick of this small cheddar\nI'm here for the lost treasure\nTryna stay on my grind while praying all of the time\nEach day I'm making a climb but taking it as a sign\nYour only given one life, make it something divine\nHave faith & take the design of satan out of ya mind\nSnakes and fake friends, know how to hate & pretent\nThats why I got me some plans\nTo save up hundreds of bands\nBuy me some properties, some businesses and some land\nAnd bust it down to my fam\nI hustle hard as I can\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Termanology"}
