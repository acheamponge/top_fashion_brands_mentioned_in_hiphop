Music, but I speak it with a different tongue\nThe numb one becomes number 1\nSee us Grammy night; bow ties and cummerbunds\nCiroc soak bad bitch, I'm layin' under one\nMake her work for it, night nurse for it\nIn the morning she can get her heel and purse for it\nWitch-doctor flow, you could say I'm cursed for it\nThe way I'm killin' shit, you should send a hearse for it\nPush!", "year": null}]}
