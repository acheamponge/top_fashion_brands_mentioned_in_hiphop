Look, we\u2019ll think you the greatest\nWhen you get all creation together to sing your praises\n\n[Chorus: KB]\nGot a lotta money, got a lotta clothes\nEverybody know ya, everywhere you go\nYou be gettin' praise all across the globe\nBut no, they ain't got no angels praisin' them, they not the man\nThey not the man, they not the man\nBut they ain't got no angels praisin' them, they not the man\nThey not the man, they not the man\nBut they ain't got no angels praisin' them, they not the man\nThey not the man, they not the man\nCats should get they minds right\nCats should get they minds right\n\n\n[Verse 2: Flame]\nThe richest man in the world is worth 40 billion, that\u2019s 40 billion more than me\nThe second man is worth 37, billion, yeah, go and see\nThat\u2019s big money, that\u2019s no sin, please don\u2019t think that\u2019s what I\u2019m sayin\u2019\nBut ain\u2019t no demons shudderin' at them, they not the man\nThey ain\u2019t never healed the sick, they ain\u2019t never raised the dead\nThey ain\u2019t fed five thousand with two fish and five loaves of bread\nSo why are y\u2019all big-headed, puffed up, arrogant?\nWhy don\u2019t y\u2019all un-lead, gas up, burn?\nIt ain\u2019t never been about \u2018em, gotta put \u2018em on the bottom\nAnd they really got a problem and He put \u2018em on the top\nBut you\u2019re forgettin\u2019 the bottom \u2018cause you fallin\u2019 like autumn\nYet you still tryna box \u2018em, are you ever gonna stop?\nAyo KB, my prayer is that cats are made aware of His\nInfinite preeminence, their images, it\u2019s all His\nThey were made to reflect Him, represent and respect Him\nWith cars and clothes and cheap thrills we still choose to reject Him\nHe is Big, we are small, He's Creator, we're creation\nHe is God, we are man\nRight response, fall on our faces\n\n[Chorus: KB]\nGot a lotta money, got a lotta clothes\nEverybody know ya, everywhere you go\nYou be gettin' praise all across the globe\nBut no, they ain't got no angels praisin' them, they not the man\nThey not the man, they not the man\nBut they ain't got no angels praisin' them, they not the man\nThey not the man, they not the man\nBut they ain't got no angels praisin' them, they not the man\nThey not the man, they not the man\nCats should get they minds right\nCats should get they minds right"}], "artist": "KB"}
