Fuck fuck fuck the police!\n[Fuck them motherfuckers!]\nFuck fuck fuck the police!\n[Get paid back] You're motherfucking right yo\n\nVerse One: Dr. Dre\n\nFuck the motherfucking police!\nThey don't want peace they want a nigga deceased\nSo he'll cease to be a problem and by the way the perform\nIt seems the Klan gave the white police another uniform\nAnd yo the black police, the house niggas\nThey gave you a motherfucking gun, so I guess you figure\nYou made out, good to go, but you didn't know\nThey would stick your black ass back in the ghetto, yo\nTo kill another nigga, catch him with crack, in fact\nFreebase - they put in the neighborhood in the first place\nBut the brothers ain't stupid, remember that\nYou got a gat, I got a gat, so whassup with that\nA to the motherfuckin K\nThe last words you hear, then the smoke appears\nTears, from your motherfuckin family\nThey're starin at me, but I'm goin gun happy, fuck em!\nShootin everything in sight tonight's the night to get hyped\nAnd fight for what's wrong, fuck what's right!\nAnd by the way, my name is Dre\nSo listen up motherfucker to what I gotta say, yo\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINTRO 2\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChorus:\n\nFuck the police! Fuck, fuck, fuck the police\nFuck\nFuck, fuck, fuck the police\n[Now for the first episode]\n\nVerse Two: Eazy-E\n\nEazy E's the name feared by most\nWhen, a lil nigga is thrown in the pen\nBut on the streets there's two kinds of people\nWhite rich fucks and the ones who get harassed like me\nPull over to the side, routine for me\nTearin up my shit, like they lookin for a key of cocaine\nBut they never find the shit\nAin't got nuttin better to do and nobody else to fuck wit\nThinkin everything is stolen\nBut can't face facts that a young black nigga's just rollin\nMaking more money than they ever make\nTaking more shit than they ever take\nYo pigs are made to kill, and no regret and\nKeep your hand on your weapon shoot his ass and start steppin\nCause I'm a nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin\nSo let me explain a lil somethin, yo\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nINTRO 3\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSee, I got this problem, a big problem...\nCops don't like me, so I don't like motherfucking cops\n\nChorus:\n\nFuck the police! Fuck, fuck, fuck the police\nFuck\nFuck, fuck, fuck the police\n[Fuck the police!]\n\nPolice brutality is common in my neighborhood\nThat's why I hate them motherfuckers\n\nVerse Three: MC Ren\n\nI said fuck the police but with a little more force\nAnd maybe now I get my point across\nIt's a lot here that's goin on, just open your eyes and look\nEveryday a young nigga is took\nOff the face of the street by a police\nIt's like they gotta a nigga chained on a short leash\nYou can't leave out the city that they shacked up\nCause if you do that's the right they got you jacked up\nIt's embarassin because you know they justice, but all you can do\nIs say fuck this, because if you move, that's all she wrote\nSo what? The excuse to shoot, or they rather stomp your head\nTil you're dead with the steel toe boot\nHarassin me with some kind of mind game\nActin like a nigga just was born with a gang-name\nYou call that right but when you're black there's no right\nSome recreational shit was only a gang fight\nSo shootin at the cops was a street thing\nTo waste time have to explain don't do cocaine\nBut everything was done just for peace\nTo retaliate, on the fuckin police, so I'm sayin\n\nChorus:\n\nFuck the police! Fuck, fuck, fuck the police!\nFuck\nFuck the police!
