One, Two, Three, Come On\n\n[Verse 1]\nLet your girl breathe and explore until the time right\nI've been chasing lime light, no time to get her mind right\nYeah I got some other girls, but I just give 'em klondike\nTrying out some new things, I might just hit a blonde dyke\nI don't give a damn, get it in 'til the time out\nI been spitting rhymes now, finally bout to shine now\nMy bitch Pocahontas, got no problems, got her new shoes\nThen she do her thing, hands-free like a blue tooth\nYoung Veggies cracked a couple hoes, had a few schools\nAsk about the boy in L-A, man I'm too cool\nI'mma cop a Benz, Anwar gon' cop a new Coupe\nJosh take this girl whip and he drop her to school\nCasey, how you live? All these girls and good food\nFresh raps, got my set, cash you hate a nigga's fool (?)\nI put my niggas on, don't hang with different crews\nIt's ridiculous that you would try to ridicule\n\n[Hook]\nI think I should go, Man I don't have to stay\nI'll get out the way\nYeah, I said\nI think I should go (think I should go), I don't have to stay (Man, I don't have to stay)\nI'll get out the way\nYeah\n(I mean, I don't wanna go. But...\nI guess I got to, you making me feel like I got to\nCome on)\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn a deep dream dwelling off my accomplishments\nI don't think she should come just cuz I'm on my shit\nI feel dumb, I'm too young, just need to swallow it\nBut I want her so bad it's like I'm gargling\nYoung boy stuntin' but I'm not a star\nDid a couple shows, time to cop a car\nAnd life sometimes, we just don't know who we are\nSo every bar like a letter testament to God\nI'm feeling odd like my future where it all start\nBut I'm tryna keep it moving on my own tint\nI be thinking why she do this as the phone ring\nBut I just hang up cuz she did the same thing\nDamn.... Damn, She did the same thing\nBut who knows, we'll see\nKeep going 'til the fat lady sings, Young CV\n\n(Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system\nWhen you finish recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more options)\n\n[Hook]\n\n(Man you need to stop holding shit in man\nSay what you gotta say man)\n\n[Verse 3]\nMaybe I should go, just let me know\nNever have to stay, I'll be right on my way\nEscorted by a girl with a cute face\nEarly day and we headed to the matinee\nWhen I was younger I dreamed of flying and putting time in\nAt time, life needs fresh creations and new design and\nMy logo stitched, my sneakers sick, and my jeans designer\nDesignated for Heaven's gates, where the sun is shining\nI used to hope for a mind that was unconfined\nNot smoking blunts, fucking dimes, that's a waste of time\nAnd in the next moment, everything in my head switch\nI found myself doing that same thing, like its fine\nI thought for a long time on what I should write\nSpent a lot of late nights making sure it's right\nA whole story, yo it's true and all that you should know\nDon't take it personal, but I think I should go\n\n[Hook]\nI mean, I don't wanna go (damn) but...\nI guess I got to, making me feel like I got to\nCome on\nI had a dream... Know what I'm saying\nI had a dream... that we could do whatever, whatever we wanted to do\nYou know, we could do whatever we thought was, was possible know what I'm saying\nFollow your dreams...\nFollow your motherfuckin' dreams man...\nYeah, forever in our hearts\nMind, body and soul\nCustomized Greatly 3\n2012 and beyond\nGone"}]}
