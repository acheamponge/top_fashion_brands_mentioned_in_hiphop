(the broken neck)\nIf it was over then?\nI'm afraid of what happens next\nLivin' like you'll never die, you'll die havin' never lived\nWorried over making ends meet, forget you'll meet your end\nI'm afraid of dyin' but my death I almost welcome it\nApproach it like I do my bed, that's just how I enter it\nGot me draped up and then dripped out\nStreets paved in that 500k\nWhile He's throwing my sins out\nNo regrets, just righteousness\nAnd I can't wait to be like him\nLife only gets better boy\nWith eternity on your eyelids\nImma sleep well, it's been settled boy\n\n[Outro] (x2)\nI'm still okay, I'm still okay\nThis gon' be a good night\nI'm still okay, I'm still okay\nAnd we gon' go to bed fine"}], "artist": "KB"}
