Might get the point from a spear gun\nMy Jackets is Full Metal\u2014you wanna wear one?\nMind state in a place (Come on) where the great dare come (Come on)\nMy mind state in a place (Come on) where the great dare come (Come on)\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nI tote L\u2019s, polly on life and death\nI can\u2019t be alright/all right (Why?)\u2014there would be no left\nDeal equal\u2014bring new life and kill people\nYou gotta be good when it\u2019s evil\nMake liars believe you \u2018til blind people see through\nDeaf heads heed you, gun tongue speak truth\nI tote L\u2019s, polly on life and death\nI can\u2019t be alright/all right (Why?)\u2014there would be no left\nDeal equal\u2014bring new life and kill people\nYou gotta be good when it\u2019s evil\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nThe cypher\u2019s ill\u2014go hold your seat on a Ferris wheel (Watch out)\nBalance the scale.  The other day, I did something ill for real\nAte pork then drank spring water distilled\nThings switched up\u2014bubblegum feet stand still\nI\u2019m the last piece of love in your heart\nThe anger dark from the start\nBig-puzzle rap\u2014I\u2019m just playing my part\nI write light to escape the dark, but it\u2019s still here\nI don\u2019t give a fuck, but I still care\nGreedy ones share riches, stairs become stitches\nDepicting vision\u2014I\u2019m getting better at the sick shit\nSome say I got the illest, most nasty flow\nBut I\u2019m the sun\u2014you don\u2019t have to gas me, yo\nI ship kis/keys, mail Swizz Beatz a Casio\nGet serious, in fact, like Jim Carrey jokes\nDo the knowledge, inspect my truth\u2014I\u2019m sincere\nThe shadow of the circle is a square\nSo I don\u2019t care if your brain is pierced with purple hair\nI\u2019m from the essence.  Be easy or you\u2019ll get sent there\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nI tote L\u2019s, polly on life and death\nI can\u2019t be alright/all right (Why?)\u2014there would be no left\nDeal equal\u2014bring new life and kill people\nYou gotta be good when it\u2019s evil\nMake liars believe you \u2018til blind people see through\nDeaf heads heed you, gun tongue speak truth\nI tote L\u2019s, polly on life and death\nI can\u2019t be alright/all right (Why?)\u2014there would be no left\nDeal equal\u2014bring new life and kill people\nYou gotta be good when it\u2019s evil\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nKing in the ring on some diamond shit.  Rhyming quick, I switch directions\nSome lust, self-combust\u2014just read expression\nMajor league, make it hard to breath, bloody your fatigues\nStudy your sneeze and think how I\u2019ll bless you\u2014\u201cDegrees\u201d\nIn the morning, I choke L\u2019s, then brush my teeth\nFuck fighting\u2014most heads get snuffed with heat\nThe killing fields.  Unconceal plots for real\nBlocks is hot like the average cop shot plot\nIn junior high, my people brought guns to school\nFuck the rules\u2014the mentality was \u201cBuck the blues!\u201d\nAnd don\u2019t get suspending blowing smoke, burning incense\nSome got married to a life sentence\u2014no repentance\nThe murder incidents is endless, death is business\nThe best defense is the fences.  No coincidences\nBastards classic like Vlasic Pickles\nBad habits get you blasted with massive missiles\nIf cash is the issue, in the grave, stash it with you (Take you)\nUnder that stone with your first, middle, and last initial\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nI tote L\u2019s, polly on life and death\nI can\u2019t be alright/all right (Why?)\u2014there would be no left\nDeal equal\u2014bring new life and kill people\nYou gotta be good when it\u2019s evil\nMake liars believe you \u2018til blind people see through\nDeaf heads heed you, gun tongue speak truth\nI tote L\u2019s, polly on life and death\nI can\u2019t be alright/all right (Why?)\u2014there would be no left\nDeal equal\u2014bring new life and kill people\nYou gotta be good when it\u2019s evil"}]}
