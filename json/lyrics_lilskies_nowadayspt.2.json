This the only thing I know\nStay down and be loyal, now we ballin' like the pros\nRemember when I used to sit and plan it with the bros\nNowadays I'm just sellin' out these shows\nShe tell me that she love me 'cause I am a dark rose\nI can't trust nobody, people fake and people fold\nYou not in my position, I work for this, I was chose\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Skies]\nSacrifices made me the man that I am\nIf I had to do it, I would go back and do it again\nI got money, now they love me, be acting like they my friends\nFuck that shit, I block them out, I'm not letting them people in\nRed eyes, layin' low behind the tint\nRemember times running from the cops, I jumped the fence\nNow it's not a problem 'cause I made my mama rich\nFuck them niggas hating, we gon' throw 'em in the ditch\n\n[Chorus: Lil Skies]\nHold up, walking on a tightrope\nHow could I switch on you? This the only thing I know\nStay down and be loyal, now we ballin' like the pros\nRemember when I used to sit and plan it with the bros\nNowadays I'm just sellin' out these shows\nShe tell me that she love me 'cause I am a dark rose\nI can't trust nobody, people fake and people fold\nYou not in my position, I work for this, I was chose\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Skies]\nI can't lie, me and you, we not the same\nI started from the bottom, took my time and built a name\nThey thought I would be dead but I'm still bringing major pain\nSorry, make it rain\nMeet me on the side, we fly\nHit the 'Wood and close my eyes, I'm so high\nTakin' flights to Dubai just to vibe\nYou can see it in my eyes, I'm so alive\n\n[Chorus: Lil Skies]\nHold up, walking on a tightrope\nHow could I switch on you? This the only thing I know\nStay down and be loyal, now we ballin' like the pros\nRemember when I used to sit and plan it with the bros\nNowadays I'm just sellin' out these shows\nShe tell me that she love me 'cause I am a dark rose\nI can't trust nobody, people fake and people fold\nYou not in my position, I work for this, I was chose\n\n[Verse 3: Landon Cube]\nYeah, you're not in my position, I was chosen\nBut I never played the victim, I'm a soldier, thought I told you\nWhere were you when I was on the floor? Yeah\nI need closure, I need rest\nI need more drugs, I need less\nI roll up my medication, never sober\nI'll be smokin' on this OG 'til it's over\nMy four leaf clover, and I\nPush my luck until it's over\n\n[Chorus: Lil Skies]\nHold up, walking on a tightrope\nHow could I switch on you? This the only thing I know\nStay down and be loyal, now we ballin' like the pros\nRemember when I used to sit and plan it with the bros\nNowadays I'm just sellin' out these shows\nShe tell me that she love me 'cause I am a dark rose\nI can't trust nobody, people fake and people fold\nYou not in my position, I work for this, I was chose"}], "artist": "Lil Skies"}
