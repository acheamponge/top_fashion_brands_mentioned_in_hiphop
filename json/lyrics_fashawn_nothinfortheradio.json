Cole]\nMay I kick a little something for the G's and cold hearted niggas that's freezin'\nEverythang happens for a reason\nBut why a nigga stuck shit, this ain't nothing for the radio, nah this ain't nothing for the radio\nNah, this right here what you've been waiting for, hey this right here what you've been waiting for\n\n[Verse 2: Fashawn]\nWhy is it me that this dark cloud follows?\nI probably drown in this Belvedere bottle\nUgh I get my hymns from him it's a revival\nThe limits keep my hands spinning like a gyro\nI need a chiro-prac, cause I feel like I'm alone in this world\nWho got my back?\nThey tell me find god like I don't know where he at\nAnd if he lost why we following him\nJust acknowledge the fact that a father exists\nAnd the devil's alive, I'm just caught in the mix\nBefore he shines his light on me I was out on the strip\nHolding it down till I discovered my gift (got talent bro, I'm telling you)\nIt felt more like a curse, in my hoodie, I still made it to church\nJust in time they hear the pastor complain like sunshine after the rain, help us out\n\n[Hook: J. Cole]", "title": "Nothin For The Radio"}]}
