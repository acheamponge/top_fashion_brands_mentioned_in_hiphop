Bye\n\n[Verse 1]\nLately I've been afraid of myself\nThe closer that I get to rain\nThe more I feel at home, the further I'm away\nAnd all that I feel is pain\n\n[Hook]\nCount me, count me, call my name\nDon't leave me out in shame\nCause these crimson tears falling\nAnd my shirt is blood-stained\nAnd the devil's forever in my veins\nAnd the devil's forever in my veins\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe morning\u2019s a cross I bear when I wake\nAm I asleep? Have I broken my faith?\nDown on my knees, can you hear me when I pray?\nOr am I a little too late to...\n\n[Hook]\nCount me, count me, call my name\nDon't leave me out in shame\nCause these crimson tears falling\nAnd my shirt is blood-stained\nCause the devil's forever in my veins\nAnd the devil's forever in my veins\n\n[Hook]\nCount me, count me, call my name\nDon't leave me out in shame\nCause these crimson tears falling\nAnd my shirt is blood-stained\nAnd the devil's forever in my veins\nThe devil's forever in my veins\nThe devil's forever in my veins", "title": "Devil in My Veins"}]}
