This means W.A.R\n16s bust to break unjust laws\nOverthrow regimes in the name of the cause\nRenegades, never slaves, this means war\nOne-hundred percent uncut raw\nFuck limited freedom, nigga we want more\nThe machine is corrupted down to the core\nRebel army, muthafucka, this - means - war\n\n[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]\nI got a middle finger for mass media, mute the news\nCause When The Gun Draws received a million views\nWhich gives me the right to break the rules\nSay fuck the radio if the people can't pick and choose\nWhile BET gets screwed by Viacom\nThe new revolutionary is shyaman\nIt's not brush fire rap, it's five alarm\nMotivational music after I am gone\nMy inner visions, mysticism call me Mr. Wisdom\nThey wanna turn the globe into a prison\nAnd being sick is better than being dead\nCause when you sick and in bed, you're indebted to meds\nCloned chickens walking around without heads\nThe food is contaminated, the water got lead in it\nPopulation control, make the babies sick\nRFID chips, are you for 86?\nThis is a war against consciousness\nControlling your soul, sort of a psychological dictatorship\nAnd we are on the front lines\nGuilty as charged if intellect is a crime\n\n[Hook: Immortal Technique]\nWe are renegades. This means W.A.R\n16s bust to break unjust laws\nOverthrow regimes in the name of the cause\nRenegades, never slaves, this means war\nOne-hundred percent uncut raw\nFuck limited freedom, nigga we want more\nThe machine is corrupted down to the core\nRebel army, muthafucka, this - means - war\n\n[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch]\nAlhamdulillah's a spiritual calling\nMy alternate and we are still mourning\nIt's not a documentary about global warming\nThis is lunar explosions of global warning\nSo when the moon leaves you can't tell night from morning\nCities submerged underwater post New Orleans\nIt's not your average rap recording\nThis is insane lieutenants taking aim at Mormons\nWhile the American dream remains dead and dormant\nMy stimuli's supplied by my endorphins\nThe mind's eye greater than pi and broadband\nI break on through to the other side without doormen\nIt's not The Doors, man\nI am equipped with a better memory chip than dolphins\nWith more keys to open more doors than four foremen\nTo executive's rooms where they walking on all fours man\nCanines standing upright amongst you\nHated by swine, spreading the H1N1 flu\nOn some rabies shit, RU-486\nPopulation control, make the babies sick\nThis is a war against consciousness\nControlling your soul, sort of a psychological dictatorship\nAnd I am on the front lines\nGuilty as charged if intellect is a crime\n\n[Hook: Immortal Technique]\nWe are renegades.
