Clark)]\nApe Drums, Steven Clark, and yours truly\nMr. W.W., haha!\nI told you once (Can't Have)\nI tell you twice (Can't Have)\nThe grass looks greener on the other side\nTil you get to the other side, haha\n\n[Pre-Hook: Steven A. Clark]\nWell you're happy now\nAnd I'm so glad, 'cause you're so rad\nBut I guess we always want what we can't have\nYou know the loneliness hurts so bad\nAnd girl I want you back\nBut I guess we always want what we can't have\n\n[Hook: Steven A. Clark]\nCan't have\nCan't have\nCan't have\nOhhhhhh!\n\n[Verse 1: Pitbull]\nI see Central Park from my hotel room\nAnd it's got me thinking\nAbout the crazy things we used to do\nFor the fame, for the power, for the fortune\nDucked prison, ducked death, I'm fortunate\nIt was all a dream, now I wake up and live it\nThinking that the sky was the limit\n'Til I figured out there's footprints on the moon\nNow I'm like get out the way, bitch move\n\n[Bridge: Pitbull]\nPapo I'm live, fuck the other side\nI'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die\nEveryone knows that this chico gon' ride\nNow I won't kill you but I'll watch you die\nI'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die\nEveryone knows that this chico gon' ride\nNow I won't kill you but I'll watch you die\nEveryone wants what they can't have right?\n\n[Pre-Hook: Steven A. Clark]\nWell you're happy now\nAnd I'm so glad, 'cause you're so rad\nBut I guess we always want what we can't have\nYou know the loneliness hurts so bad\nAnd girl I want you back\nBut I guess we always want what we can't have\n\n[Hook: Steven A. Clark]\nCan't have, can't have\nCan't have, can't have\nCan't have, can't have\nCan't have, ohhhhhh!\n\n[Verse 2: Pitbull]\nLooking at my backyard, now all I see the ocean\nNot bad for a kid that grew up with roaches\nDrama, chaos, and different cultures\nThat's what allows me to see through these vultures\nFirst we shined the shoes\nThen we own the shoe shop\nFirst we make the sandwich\nThen we own the restaurants\nFirst then we clean the house\nThen we own every house on the block\nNot bad for some immigrants\n\n[Bridge: Pitbull]\nPapo I'm live, fuck the other side\nI'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die\nEveryone knows that this chico gon' ride\nNow I won't kill you but I'll watch you die\nI'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die\nEveryone knows that this chico gon' ride\nNow I won't kill you but I'll watch you die\nEveryone wants what they can't have right?\n\n[Pre-Hook: Steven A. Clark]\nWell you're happy now\nAnd I'm so glad, 'cause you're so rad\nBut I guess we always want what we can't have\nYou know the loneliness hurts so bad\nAnd girl I want you back\nBut I guess we always want what we can't have\n\n[Hook: Steven A. Clark]\nCan't have, can't have\nCan't have, can't have\nCan't have, can't have\nCan't have, ohhhhhh!\n\n[Outro: Steven A. Clark]\nBut I guess we always want what we can't have", "year": "2016-11-21"}]}
