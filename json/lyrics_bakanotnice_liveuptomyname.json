I never ran\nDon't make me turn this red light on your head like you Roxanne\nOnly talk to bosses, not the second-in-command\nNiggas bringin' talks to me, you better have a plan\n'Cause they don't have a cure for all my pain\nA.K.A. it's Not Nice and I live up to my name\n\n[Chorus]\nGyah, gyah! Diss The Boy? Are you insane?\nI drink Henny when I shoot my pistol at the range\nThat way, when I'm tipsy, I still know I got my aim\nA.K.A. it's Not Nice and it's not a fuckin' game\nGyah, gyah! You and I, we're not the same\nPosted like Ibaka, got your wifey runnin' brains\nShe was there with boydem, kicked my front door off the frame\nShe say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain\nTrap, trap, trappin' in the rain\nShe say I look like Usher when I'm trappin' in the rain\nJust know I'm a shooter first and rap is not my thing\nA.k.a. it's Not Nice and I live up to my\u2014\n\n[Verse 2]\nHidin' in the racks\nI don't pay tax, twelve on my back\nMight drive the Caddy around but I never lack\nBaka not with the shit? So yeah, who tellin' you that?\nI went to jail the day they released Men in Black\nWhen I came out, Timberlake was bringin' Sexy Back\nFacts, nigga! Facts!\nI fell in love with my strap\nNamed my son Milli 'cause I want a milli' to stack\nGyah, gyah! Go run and tell that\nYou niggas move like the cops, don't make me pepper your block\nOut the window while the whip's movin', that's a hell of a shot\nFuck all my opps, I'll put you niggas on FOX\n\n[Chorus]\nGyah, gyah! Diss The Boy? Are you insane?\nI drink Henny when I shoot my pistol at the range\nThat way, when I'm tipsy, I still know I got my aim\nA.K.A. it's Not Nice and I live up to my\u2014", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5a427315cd15fb7bd6d97fad2ac7cb52.355x355x1.jpg", "year": "2017-05-28", "title": "Live Up to My Name", "album": "4Milli"}]}
