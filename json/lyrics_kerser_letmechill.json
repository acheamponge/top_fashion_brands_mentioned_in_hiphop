Damn\nCrazy thoughts that I'm livin' amongst\nThey won't leave my fuckin' brain 'cause there's a blizzard of dust\nRidiculous stuff, I see the bitch in you cunt\nJust jealous 'cause I made it and I'm livin' it up\nI don't know what to do, should I be zippin' it up?\nNot my mouth or body bag on you conspicuous cunts\nJust let me chill\n\n[Bridge]\n\nFuck\nJust let a cunt chill\nI need some space brah\nLook\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nKeep my name out your mouth, 'cause I'm cruisin' in my own lane\nLeave the scene behind, sorry but I gotta go mate\nIt's that simple, crash and smash into\nNoddin' at the wheel, shoulder impact through the window\nThat's leavin' the scene with a bang yeah\nSee that phone still mine, yeah the same chair\nI don't take care, I think I care-take\nProbably 'cause there's too much on my damn plate\nTen for ten, that's the aim with the Nebs One\nWill keep the promise 'cause I can't see a next up\nThat could do what I do in the booth\nThat could move, that could soothe, what I do for the youth\nI work harder with rap, than any rapper in Aus\nIt ain't a diss, that's a fact and I swear it to God\nStop comparin' me, I'm on my own level bitch\nAnd it's scary 'cause I kinda hear the Devil twitch\nNo thinkin, what am I drinkin'? What am I mixin'?\nWhat you might listen? Scot, your right, we think...\nStop, I might be the option I see, then what, is he dreamin'?\nStop, I'm not bleedin', lost enough demons\nPlot a rough secret, see your team decrease\nMe, I been seein' shit, leave me in pieces\nTwo-two-five to the death, I've been reachin' up\nBut it's never like I'm ditchin rap\nStill with the crew I'd be with if I didn't rap\nThat's some brotherhood shit, we the best team\nYour girl plays this at night, it's a wet dream\nNow let's see and emcee like me\nI create the air and I can split the sea\nThat confidence shit, no arrogance bitch\nUnless you tryna' take shots, we retaliate quick\nBut I'm here for a good time, not for some suppy shit\nUnless you see me in the club and I fuckin' flip\nHad enough of it, shit I had to air it out\nIf I left, would you care? You have to swear on that\nKerser"}], "artist": "Kerser"}
