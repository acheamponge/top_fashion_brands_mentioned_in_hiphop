But nobody really understands what an 80s baby is. You know, what it represents. What we were born into. You see, I feel like I represent the 80s without wearing the big dookie rope gold chains, you know? I'ma show y'all how. Take y'all back with me if y'all don't mind\n\n[Verse One]:\nLook\n80's baby\nMillennium teen\nYo MTV Raps on the TV screen\nMy nigga Kareem was like Radio Raheem\nBlast his boom box on Do The Right Thing\nLogos in our hair, I had the swoosh from Nike\nHad a crush on Salt-N-Pepa, I was only like 3\nCouldn't afford a Gameboy, my momma got me Linx\nAnd I played Space Invaders till the screen went green\nGrew up on Arlene, my crew was called the Aces\nWe had the sickest cycles and we killed rivals and racists\nI had a hoop so we balled all night\nI couldn't shoot, I had a shot like Bill Cartwright\nBut that wasn't important\nHad a box of jersey's and everybody fight over who gets to be Jordan\nHad a crush on Chili after CrazySexyCool\nAnd that Red Light Special had me digging on you, yeah\n80's baby\nMillennium teen\nChicago Bulls was everybody's favorite team\nGetting a Super Nintendo was a thing in your dreams\nI was the first one on the block with it, felt like a king\nHa, fitting right?\nMomma had trouble with bills, but you 12, you don't know what living's like\nLiving life?\nI was fine trying to chill\nIn an open field filled with grass with a kite\nTrying to catch lightening bugs in the night\nArgue with your best friend and it ends in a fight\nThe next day, everything's alright\nThey knocking at your door saying, \"Wanna ride bikes?\"\nHaha\nDamn I miss them times\nAnd I miss them rhymes\nIt all changed though in '99\nYou know we all grew up"}], "artist": "XV"}
