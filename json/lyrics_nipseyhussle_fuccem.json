I did my own black history\nStudied Illmatic raised the roof out\nYeah, that's the main reason why these other rappers can't get with me\nFuck em all, I hear a whistle know it's time to ball\nY'all niggas throwing fouls but y'all don't wanna brawl\nHow you going to mission with no vision\nFuck Stevie's like a sight\nLook at Stevie's ambition\nWe hood niggas that did it\n\n(Verse 3:Cuzzy Capone)\nDifferent nigga now that my pops gone\nLow tolerance promised he'll get popped on\nMicrowave the bullets sounding like popcorn\nGrind heavy the cops come or the rocks gone\nSame nigga 'cept with the time changed\nWhen I couldn't get money I used to find ways\nCountin' thousands up for cavvy in the hallway\nIt wasn't long til I figured out grind pays\nWe still in search of them bright days\nDark streets only light when police raid\nWhen niggas stress out and let the shots off\n(?) like a skillet, it'll pop off\nI hit the ave and post with the uncut raw\nSacked it up and told niggas I had to (?)\nNothing fancy, protect myself with the 8 ball\nIt wasn't easy, I had to hustle on (?)\n\n(Hook)\nBury me the realest that ever did it yeah\nHopefully my day ones will remember this\nKeep that shit a hunnid on until the death\nEven when I'm gone they'll see I never left\nLooking at the whip like, \"Man I'm glad I never quit\"\nGots my niggas with me thought I'd never hit\nStickin' to the script yeah we should never switch\nAll my role models doin' sentences\n\n(Chorus)\n(fucc em all, fucc em all fucc em all fucc em all fucc em all fucc em all fucc em all, fucc em all fucc em all- fucc em all, fucc em all fucc em all fucc em all fucc em all)"}], "artist": "Nipsey Hussle"}
