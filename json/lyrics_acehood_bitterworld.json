Ain't that right, Tony?\nGas prices high, niggas dying young\nBad role models, that's what that came from\nThat's what that came from\n\n(This Bitter World) My God\n(Well, well) My God (Well, This Bitter Earth)\n\nDear World, dear World, I need you undivided\nAnd know some choices that we made were highly undecided\nWe keep it in mind, we givin em signs, the time just disregard it\n(This bitter world)\nSome live in the blind afraid of the light\nBut pain just can't be departed\nThe things that I seen, I wish it was dreams, it seems I'm sleeping hardly\nLost a lot of homies, endured a lot of pain\nPray for better nights, slowly they became\nI hear my phone ring, fuck who callin me\nI just hope that it's success who trying to bother peace\nFuck this bitter world, with no apologies\nBabies having babies, what could your father be\nSick of being tired, and tired of being broke\nMama worked too hard, I pray no signs of stroke\nMicrophone and words, clearly show me hope\nWithout it I'm alone, clearly you should know\n\n(Well, well)\nAmen\n(Well, This Bitter Earth)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/43069cfe14bf14e83156fff65a672028.1000x1000x1.jpg"}]}
