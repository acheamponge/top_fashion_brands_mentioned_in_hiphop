It's fight night world wide\nHe's coming, he's coming, he's coming, he's coming!\n\n[Hook]\nNothing is real, can't touch, can't feel\nNothing is right, can't save my life!\n\n[Verse 2]\nStay wise and rise to the other side\nFree the mind and unify, let's redefine\nLove and hate, don't complicate\nWhen we all die\nDon't intensify the struggles that I have inside\nSolidify the reason why, people ask why?\nCan't see the light they blow it out each and every time\nClear the path feel the wrath\nNow I'm free\nGet from in front of me!\n\nHe's coming, he's coming, he's coming, he's coming\n\n[Hook]\n\nYou can't make me die, now I testify, through you I can see\nGet from in front of me\n\nYou can't make me die, now I testify, through you I can see\nGet from in front of me, now!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Hook]", "album": "Bi-Polar: Skabz", "image": "https://images.genius.com/59251b7fa08499183d8cba480fbeeb28.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
