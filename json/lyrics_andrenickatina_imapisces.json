I got cocaine raps\n\nYa hardcore CB4 uproar made a nice comeback, but didn't touch my score\nA Farrakhan listener, white world prisoner\nMy frisk down is just like the state pen for visitors\nGhetto red hots, guns, crack and macks, fly clubs, no love and cocaine raps\nSpendin' ways incredible, money untraceable\nNiggas start to jack when the money ain't available\nBaby you talk too much, pass the blunt\nI'm tryin' to give your fine ass the raw and uncut\nI got no time to be a crybaby fool\nForgive me, but they got me packin' pocket tools\n\nFresh out say fuck 'em, yeah, I made a gang of raps\nSmokin' weed in a rental with the gangsta tracks\nStraight chewy, and a nigga got a gang of pride\nCheck the battle or the struggle through my Chinese eyes\nHad to tighten up the fade, got my murder 1 shades\nStill tryin' to fuck them freaks from my highschool days\nB. Adams, do you still love me?\nCuz ya first born is strugglin' and it's hard to stay drug free\nCock back loaded and about to explode\nLike the 12 story 'jects, bitch I'm outta control\nAlpine reliant, police defiant, Kentucky Fried and Popeye's #1 client\nRepresent the look like the great Sam Cook\nPut a star by every freak in my true black book\nClutch tight fist pumped way in the air, pagan\nYou dealin' with a microphone bear\nTear, pear, where?, stare, check it, I don't care\n\nI just can't quit, shit, the rap game fanatic\nTryna stay calm with a mad weed habit\nCussin' and fussin' at 100 degrees\nI think like a blind thief with the vision of g's\nChewy used to do me, listen to Ice-T\nYa lookin' at a nigga who wish he was drug free\nBut nigga that's a dream in another life\nSo until then my last word is re-light"}]}
