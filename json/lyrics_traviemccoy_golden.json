Maybe one day, we'll have a golden child\nHaha, and that\u2019s word to Eddie Murphy\nI wouldn't trade places if you threatened to hurt me\nTwo peas in a pod that could never be open\nI\u2019m cool all by myself, but together we golden, yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Sia]\nYou got that look in your eyes, eyes\nI can tell you had bad dreams last night\nLet me take you in my arms; you can cry, cry\nLet me love you 'til you feel alright\n'Cause I am yours; you are mine, you are mine, mine\nNot going anywhere, I am standing by your side\nI will love you 'til the end of time, time\nI will love you 'til the day we die\n\n[Chorus: Sia]\nDon't fear, baby, 'cause you and me are golden\nWhen you can't breathe, it's you that I'll be holdin'\nYes, I'm all in, through thick and thin\nThis is good loving; you and me are golden\nWe are golden, I ain't goin' anywhere"}], "artist": "Travie McCoy"}
