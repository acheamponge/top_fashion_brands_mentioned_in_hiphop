That's your motherfucking skill?\nYou stay frozen in time\nRemember in Miami we had it frozen with lime?\nI might not be car for car, but I'm bar for bar\nNothing would ever diminish my star\nI'm the rapper's rapper, but first I'm your man\nI wear my heart on my sleeve as sure as I stand\nWhether we go to war for a penny or a grand\nWhether we up top or in this hot south land\nI won't back down an inch\nTeams is marked in history, how they react in a pinch\nUnderstand that, yo, let's build a legacy, a dynasty\n\n[Hook]", "album": "Love, Hell or Right"}], "artist": "Sadat X"}
