Are you c-cummin?\nAnd I'ma ask you is it runnin, baby?\nYou ain't never had the shit til you got dug by a thug\nAnd fucked doggy style on a bear skin rug\nUp and down stairs in the back of a limo\nOn Interstate 5 on the way to San Francisco\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg]\nYou make me go crazy baby\nWhen I see a sexy girl\nI really go crazy baby\nWhen I see a sexy girl\nYou make me go crazy baby\nWhen I see a sexy girl\nYou make me go crazy baby\nWhen I see a sexy girl\n\n[Bridge: Nate Dogg]\nYou make me, hmm\nYou make me go\nYou make me, hmm\nYou make me go\nYou make me, hmm\nYou make me go\nYou make me, hmm\nYou make me go\nI'm having a ball, watch out for I fall\nI'm headed for the girl that's standing on the wall\nNo flashing no bills, just testing my skills\nI'm looking for a sexy girl so we can peel\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg]\nYou make me go crazy baby\nWhen I see a sexy girl\nI really go crazy baby\nWhen I see a sexy girl\nYou make me go crazy baby\nWhen I see a sexy girl\nYou make me go crazy baby\nWhen I see a sexy girl"}], "artist": "Nate Dogg"}
