No?\nYou already seen me turn a man to a G.O.A.T\nYou already know what I could do with the coke\nDropped it in the water, made it disappear\nI made it reappear, I had that bitch on a rope\nI make my roof get ghost, bottom grill, I make my tooth get gold\nAll the shit I did, I wasn't supposed to live, Hallelujah Hov\nWasn't for the 'caine wouldn't be able\nWasn't for the bread, probably be dead\nBest friends become ya enemies, niggas' knives are double-edged\n\n[Hook: Travis Scott]\nShit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me\nI was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of your history\nShit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me\nI was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of they history", "title": "Crown", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/MCHG_cover.jpg", "year": "2013-07-04", "album": "Magna Carta...
