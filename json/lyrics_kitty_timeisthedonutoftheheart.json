I'm a fool\nFor thinking you were anything but lame\nI know you're somewhere doing your thing\nAnd when the phone call it just ring and ring\nAnd you ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back\nAnd I heard the whole thing\n\n(What is it you want, Mary? You want the moon? Just say the word and I'll throw a lasso around it\nI'll take it!)"}]}
