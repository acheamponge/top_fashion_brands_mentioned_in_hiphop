Urmmm whats it\u2026 do I know [?] lot innit? And I said \u201cYeah I know cah, obviously now\u2026 you get me shit, all that you got me, all man games and all that rubbish.\" But the reason I say no in a way yeah is cah if you actually think about it, we don\u2019t really know each other that well, if you actually deep it and I barely see you and that innit. But obviously now, keep on doing what youre doing innit\n\nUh, look\n\n[Verse 1]\nLittle bro, little bro, you\u2019re the apple of my eye and like\nMore time when I don\u2019t give up, listen you\u2019re the reason why\nTurned 17 and got an attitude so sometimes talking to you gets long\nBut I need to give you my advice, I don\u2019t call I put it in a song\nSee first things first I apologise. Yeah this is me apologising\nPut your name in stereotype, didn\u2019t even ask you if you minded\nAnd I can't stunt like I know what it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like being my little bro\nBut I need to prepare you for the world, ay look come look here it goes\nYou see first things first when it comes to chicks, don\u2019t run around with your fucking dick\nYeah man that girls gonna hurt your heart, and trust me bro it\u2019s gonna hurt your piss\nBut I\u2019m hoping that you go through it early, Some lessons have to be taught\nAnd don\u2019t worry about that heartbreak bro, you lose them battles to win the wars\nAnd know all these girls ain\u2019t the same, theres bad ones that how it goes\nBut you\u2019re a king so go find your queen, don\u2019t be bitter like your big bro\nSee listen bro, Man have been a wrong'un so heavens gates I may never see\nBut the reason why I\u2019m telling you, 'cause I\u2019m hoping that you\u2019ll be a better me\n\n[Interlude]\nI need you to be a better me. Just be a better version of me you get me. I\u2019ve fucked up bare times man, so just don\u2019t be like your big bro man, be a better version of me man\n\nUh\n\n[Verse 2]\nLittle bro, little bro, be the better one of me\nDo all the shit that I couldn\u2019t do, see all the shit I couldn\u2019t see\nTurned 17 and got an attitude, that\u2019s sports games and a lot of clothes\nBut honestly, I\u2019ll buy you anything because I\u2019m just glad you ain\u2019t on the roads\nBut I still need you to be your own man, while I\u2019m trying to build this legacy\nTo give you a little head start in life so when they see you they don\u2019t think of me\nYou\u2019re my little bro, my big son, my inspiration that\u2019s all I've got\nBut all now I ain\u2019t seen your pops, since I told him that I got *bang noise*\nAnd secondly bro help your mum, there's no time to think about yourself\nIt seems like all she does is moan, but all she\u2019s asking for is help\nIt feels like say she\u2019s on your back, when she walks in it\u2019s like a hurricane\nTo just tidy up before she gets in because that way she can\u2019t complain\nSo I beg you bro just help me out and all that pain I\u2019ll reimburse\nBecause when I make it with this music thing, you and Chana won\u2019t have to work\nYour big bro I\u2019m no role model. I\u2019ve see shit you shouldn\u2019t have to see\nBut the reason why I\u2019m telling you, because I need you to be a better me\n\n(Outro)\nBe a better version of me man. Be a better version of me man, you know I love you\n\nAnd sometimes you might think I don\u2019t love you, but I love you. I swear I love you"}]}
