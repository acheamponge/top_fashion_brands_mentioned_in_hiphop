(me!)\n(Me!) (me!) (me!)\n(Me!) (me!)\n(Me!) (me!) (me!)\n\nHas anybody ever tried to change ya\nShape ya, mix and twist, rearrange ya?\nAnd tell ya, you gotta, gotta\nBecome a lawyer, politician or a doctor?\nWhy, oh why, I wonder\nIf you ain't all of that, you're a bleep and a blunder\n(Yo, that's wack) Word up, Gee\nYo, why can't they see?\n\nI wanna be me, yeah\nOh-oh\nMe, yeah\nMe, nobody else\t\t(2x)\n\nMy oh my, I must've shocked ya\nI'm paid in full, but I'm no doctor\nI got a mind of my own, and I used it\nAnd as for an occupation I choose this\nJust because your path I didn't take\nDoesn't mean capital A made a mistake\nThat's the problem, you try to rule us\nYou think you school us, but do nothin but fool us\nToo much gold and too much make-up\nMy dress too short? Yo, you better wake up\nCause I ain't you and you ain't me\nSo, why can't you see\n\nI wanna be me, yeah\nOh-oh\nMe, yeah\nMe, nobody else\t\t(2x)\n\n(Me!) (me!) (me!)\t\t(2x)\n\nI wanna be -\n\nMe, therefore I have to live up\nTo my expectations, so I can't give up\nCause one downs me and jokes\nBut just like smoke that happens to provoke\n(Me) (Trust it)\nSo bust It\nAnd keep on strivin and keep on strugglin\nCause those who talk small don't mean nothin\nAnd you gots to be the best that you can be\nAnd as long as it's up to me -\n\nI wanna be me, yeah\nOh-oh\nMe, yeah\nMe, nobody else\t\t(2x)\n\nSo - if anybody ever tries to change ya\nShape ya, mix and twist, rearrange ya\nAnd tell ya, you gotta, gotta\nBecome a lawyer, politician or a doctor\nTell em: you ain't got the right to choose for me", "year": null}]}
