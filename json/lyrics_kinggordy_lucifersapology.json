(Go back home)\nInstead, hell, I guess I'll roam (I guess I'll roam)\nI made the bed I must lie on (I must lie on)\nThe prettiest angel Heaven knows\nIn here I am God, but I miss my father\n\n[Hook]\nPlease just let me live again (I miss my Father)\nI promise I will never sin (I miss my Father)\nPlease let me awake again (I miss my Father)\nI'll praise you till the very end (I miss my Father)\n\n[Verse 3]\nPlease, God, forgive me for my sins (Forgive me for my sins)\nI wish I was by your side again (By your side again)\nBefore the world comes to an end (Comes to an end)\nI wanna look into your eyes again (Into your eyes again)\nPlease, God, forgive me for my sins (Forgive me for my sins)\nI wish I was by your side again (By your side again)\nBefore the world comes to an end\nIn here I am God, but I miss my Father\n\n[Hook]\nPlease just let me live again (I miss my Father)\nI promise I will never sin (I miss my Father)\nPlease let me awake again (I miss my Father)\nI'll praise you till the very end (I miss my Father)"}]}
