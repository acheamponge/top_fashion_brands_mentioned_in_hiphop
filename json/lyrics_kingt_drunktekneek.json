(Awww shit!)\nCan't take the plug of a .38 slug\nCan't take the drug from the teenage thug\nSo I'mma break loose and do a flip-flop top\nAnd land on my feet and show a drunk tekneek\n\n(Couldn't walk a straight line)\n(Ladies and gentlemen, I...)\n(Couldn't walk a straight line if you let me crawl)\n(Leanin to the side)\n(I know I'm drunk, man)\n(Leanin to the side, people everywhere)\n(Well alright)\n(Wants to get funked up)\n\n[ VERSE 2 ]\nM-M-M-MC's seem to get souped when they group\nWith a big name, but see, none of them is game\nFor the royal, loyal, the one that stole yo\nCoupe De Ville when you thought you could chill\nOn my street, with your freak, to freak me, the freak\nPlayed out along the week and fell steep in the creek\nSo I'mma put my crown upon the peak\nAnd do it just for the thieves with the jeeps\nI know you feel scared, I got a criminal path\nFor a laugh I watch devils get whipped by Shaft\nPooh has a mack-10, E-Swift's in the Benz with a Glock\nTakin some young girl's cock\nI grab that geno-St. Ides by the stack\nNever smoked crack, but I drunk a lotta 'yac\nMostly by the cup, grabbin my nuts to the beat\nHey yo, it's the drunk tekneek"}]}
