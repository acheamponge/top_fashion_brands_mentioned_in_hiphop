I seen 'em in boxes\nI seen 'em in YGF man, this fit game was popping\nThat nigga was stylish, I'm just being honest\nI'm fucking amazing and fly as a pilot, that's just me being too fucking modest\nNo matter what nigga, I'm shining regardless\nToo much a real nigga, sometimes I wish I was heartless\nI wish I was heartless, sometimes I wish I was heartless\nI reach for the light, but I live in the darkness\n\n[Hook]\nI can't believe these niggas tryna fuck my money up\nI found out this bitch tryna fuck my money up\nRich niggas don't do that\nLast time I checked, only bitch niggas do that\nI can't believe these niggas tryna fuck my money up\nI found out this bitch tryna fuck my money up\nRich niggas don't do that\nLast time I checked, only bitch niggas do that\n\n[Verse 3]\nThis song ain't directed at nobody in particular, you know\nIf the shoes fit, word Cinderella\nYou know I'm with the shits\nSettle down, no fella\nThe jock, 2013\nAKA, the ladies love 'em\nAKA, he know you fine\nFuck you want me to do?\n\n[Hook]\nI can't believe these niggas tryna fuck my money up\nI found out this bitch tryna fuck my money up\nRich niggas don't do that\nLast time I checked, only bitch niggas do that\nI can't believe these niggas tryna fuck my money up\nI found out this bitch tryna fuck my money up\nRich niggas don't do that\nLast time I checked, only bitch niggas do that"}]}
