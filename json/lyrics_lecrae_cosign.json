But you know, I stand tall. And it seems like that box is a little too small for me. Church clothes\n\n[Verse 2: Lecrae]\nFeels like I'm *bacbacbac ratatatat*, letting off that truth in here\nThat caged, untamed, strange man, let it loose in here\nYou may have came here sane maine, with your brain in your main frame\nBut if you can\u2019t hang man, you can lose it here\nAnd let\u2019s be clear, I don\u2019t want your approval\nAnd I don\u2019t thirst for the worthless my verses will prove it\nAll these empty executives, a lame pursuit\nAnd you can tell they are just a shell from their vain pursuits\nThey say they love my music, boy they telling tales\nThey want me sign on a dotted line, but I\u2019m not for sale\nThey want that Jay (I know), they want that Yeezy\nThey want that Lupe, they ain't hearing what you say\nI beg to differ, I think they do\nThey\u2019re listening, cause it\u2019s different, and some of them confused\nSo I\u2019m leaving clues, I give directions\nI hope they stop at the light before the intersection\n\n[Outro: Don Cannon]\nThe anticipation is over, here it is. Changing lives one by one. Another classic for you all to ride to. I go by the name of Don Cannon, The One Man Army, back to back with the homie Lecrae"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
