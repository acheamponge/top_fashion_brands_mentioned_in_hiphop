{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Sample]\nFor want of a nail the shoe was lost\nFor want of a shoe the horse was lost\nFor want of a horse the rider was lost\nFor want of a rider the battle was lost\nFor want of a battle the kingdom was lost\nAnd all for the want of a horseshoe nail\n\nThere is a hole in front of the shovel\nShovel in front of the brawn\nSix billion gorillas for whom the graves yawn\nEach within his mulish days to choose his tool of trade\nDueling blades that cued a cruel charade and fuel the flames\nFew would clue the crew into the civil\nSkip the food and land like you the man\nWho flew the coop over the pitbulls\nDash back flashy to compassionate nanopolice who sat beneath an avalanche of jagged inadequacies\nAnd I was \"Stop the Violence\" more than I was Pontius Pilate\nCops and robbers riot by the five's obnoxious sirens\nA is gullible he figure, \"all man equal, no brainer\"\nTake it his friends and neighbors didn't cater\nMoms raised the babies through a very churchy 80's\nSunday mornings reinforce the waiting gates of Hades\nAnd he brazen but apparently inferno bound now\nFor when a man of cloth recite his wrongs he wouldn't bow down\nThe punishment should fit the reasons you must punish him\nNever puncture skin or pull the colored rugs from under them\nTwo opposing mother ships shall not employ the gunners deck\nCause brotherhoods of public good do not employ the unctuous\nAnd you. observe and have the givetheth disproportionate\nTo the taketh away decide to maketh his day (do it)\nAll the stoic odium glow in a cold holster\nTo where he coulda stood easily in the tub jugglin toasters\n\n[Hook]\nNo mountain too high\nNo city too far\nNo coma tonight\nNo city tomorrow\nNo fire too live\nNo city too charred\nNo treaty to sign\nNo city to guard\n\nI picked the phone up with a grown-up mode approach\nSkin crawlin off the drawl and now I claw the awkward tone up\nI'd known it wasn't roses\nBut hoped it was less corrosive\nCoastin to the focus of the grossest diagnosis\nLike homes, the barnacles that chew upon the flesh of man\nHave clued into the suitor was capital to a beggar's hand\nAnd uncomfortably. sung a stubborn legacy of gluttony\nWith carnivores that burrow like hunters into the blood in meat - umm, what?\nChinny chin-up and the city picked this\nIn a pent-up letter numbed the spitting stigma\nAlong came a spider, sold her eggs to any buyer\nNow to shoot a ringer back with six legs wider than the driver\nIf you make no friends on the way to the top rung\nThere is no secret handshake club I do not give a fuck\nBut know the cancers make the olive branches obviously standard\nSo when they extend from the yachts and mansions drop your canons\nAll kings hang em for the cliffs side drip dry\nWill he clip the zipline or slip for his final dip dive?\nIf he live will he survive the milligrams of middle-ground\nThey pump into the pin-striped pentagrams over Tinsel-town\nOr kill a man who trickled down the city with his scissors out\nOr sickles, dipped in military hells bells and whistles\nRiders to the east, not a wild tribes\nThank you for the peace on earth and mercy miles high\n\n[Hook]\nNo mountain too high\nNo city too far\nNo coma tonight\nNo city tomorrow\nNo fire too live\nNo city too charred\nNo treaty to sign\nNo city to guard", "title": "No City", "album": "None Shall Pass", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3d6c4d11084714cc67f880d71310d197.288x288x1.jpg", "year": "2008-08-28"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
