{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nUsed to draw\nHard to admit that I used to draw\nPortraiture and the human form\nDoodle of a two-headed unicorn\nIt was soothin', movin' his arm in a fusion\nOf man-made tools and a muse from beyond\nEven if it went beautifully wrong\nIt was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong\nNo name nuisance, stews in a bedroom\nOozing a brand new cuneiform\nBarely commune with the horde\nGot a whole gray scale ungluing his world\nMight zone out to the yap of the magpie\nUnseen hand dragging his graphite\nCross contour, little bit of backlight\nBlack ink after a Bristol to baptize\nYou can't imagine the rush that ensue\nWhen you get three dimensions stuffed into two\nThen it's off to a school where it's all that you do\nBeing trained and observed by a capable few\nBack in New York, five peeps and a dog\nIn a two-bedroom doing menial jobs\nPlus, rhymin' and stealin' and being a clod\nDistractions free to maraud\nI left some years a deer in the light\nI left some will to spirit away\nI let my fears materialize\nI let my skills deteriorate\nHaunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing\nA mission that was rooted in a 20-year affinity\nIn rickety condition with an ID crisis\nNap on the front lawn, look up in the sky, it's\u2026\n\n[Hook]\nShapes falling out of the fringe\nAll heart, though we would've made cowardly kings\nThey will chop you down just to count your rings\nJust to count your rings, just to count your rings\nAnd there were colors pouring out of the fringe\nAll heart, though we would've made cowardly kings\nThey will chop you down just to count your rings\nJust to count your rings, just to count your rings\n\n[Verse 2]\nUsed to paint\nHard to admit that I used to paint\nNatural light on a human face\nStenciled fire on his roommate's bass\nIt was blooming addiction\nAmiss in the pushing of pigment\nBook like a tattooed pigskin, look\nPinhead kids of the minute\nDrank Kool-Aid from a tube of acrylic\nAnd it grew up into linseed oil over linen\nJoy to the poison, voice of the resin\nCapture a map of the gesture\nBack up, add a little accurate fat to the figure\nRedo that, move that inward\nZinc white lightning shoots from his fingers\nStudio strewn with illusion and tinctures\nStay tuned for the spooky adventures\nYou can't imagine the stars that align\nWhen a forearm starts foreshortening right\nOr a torso hung on a warping spine\nIn proportion reads as warm and alive\nRoutine day with a dirt cheap brush\nThen a week goes by and it goes untouched\nThen two, then three, then a month\nAnd the rest of your life, you beat yourself up\nI left some seasons eager to fall\nI left some work to bury alive\nI let my means of being dissolve\nI let my person curl up and die\nEating up his innards, an unfeasible anxiety\nHas brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy\nAligning with the trials of the anti-Midas\nNap on the back lawn, look up in the sky, it's\u2026\n\n[Hook]\nShapes falling out of the fringe\nAll heart, though we would've made cowardly kings\nThey will chop you down just to count your rings\nJust to count your rings, just to count your rings\nAnd there were colors pouring out of the fringe\nAll heart, though we would've made cowardly kings\nThey will chop you down just to count your rings\nJust to count your rings, just to count your rings\n\n[Outro]\nI'm getting sick and tired of never understanding\nWhere is the truth you promised?!", "title": "Rings", "album": "The Impossible Kid", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1d8582e283f0f4d717c0ba1fe12df744.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2016-02-16"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
