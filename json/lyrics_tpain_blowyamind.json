It's dark in here, it's hot in here\nGirl what are you doin to me?\nBaby stop, not in here\nI got a presidential suite\nBaby why don't we, just get out of here\nWhere we can have the freedom to be\nSecret lovers under covers, have no fear\nCause\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm about to blow ya mind, blow ya mind, blow ya mind\nGirl - I'm not here to waste ya time, waste ya time, waste ya time\nGirl I'm about to blow ya mind, blow ya mind, blow ya mind\nGirl - I'm not here to waste ya time, waste ya time, waste ya time\nGirl I'm about to blow ya mind\n\n[T-Pain]\nBaby now we're here, what'chu wanna do?\nI'll let you thank about it for a minute\nDon't worry 'bout me, I'm here to satisfy you\nAin't gotta worry about me gettin it in\nAnd your mind your body and your soul comes first to me\nIt's time to make the temperature rise\nBut we had to get away, don't want nobody to see\nWhy? Cause\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[T-Pain]\nBaby was it good - satisfactory?\nI got time so we can do it again\nWas it good for you, like it was for me?\nOne is not enough let's get the second one in\nBaby I know you've been, you've been dyin to see\nIf I can do your body right\nIf your baby could, fulfill that one fantasy\nOne more time, girl cause\n\n[Chorus] - loops in repeat until 3:48"}], "artist": "T-Pain"}
