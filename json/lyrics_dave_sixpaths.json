All for a chain and a watch\n\n[Hook]\nI grew up in estates, feds watching my face\nI'm masked up on the move, I need money in the bank like Kane\nLook, man took so many different risks on so many different days\nWhen I coulda been dead, I coulda been rich, I coulda been locked in a cage\nI grew up in estates, feds watching my face\nI'm masked up on the move, I need money in the bank like Kane\nLook, man took so many different risks on so many different days\nWhen I coulda been dead, I coulda been rich\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook, man just talk like I never took risks\nIn the field like I never took risks with squares\nWhen I put the dare in Santan and the Santan in Santander\nWait, look, man get aired\nI've done everything that you did\nI was 16 with a grand in my jeans and all the same clothes that you wear in your vid\nWalk in a party see a barbie looking nice I just give her a smile and a wink\nHer boyfriend's holding his hand in a fist like he can't get more than a bang to the ribs\nThem man there are just angry and pissed\nI took the right path, got cash in legit\nWhy so bitter, indirects on twitter them man they're just chatting for chicks\nNo them man there are just chatting for girls, they don't put ammi on scales\nThem man there, them man bad in a group they ain't run a man down by themself\nShoo shoo\nYou was in creams with a milkshake now you gotta run wid ya girl\nJump out the line to two left hooks and a right show a boy how to handle himself\nLook\nI can handle a jarring girl, I can't stand when she's acting crazy\nI got 2 brown tings in grove, I might call down AJ Tracey\nThey talk my name they just talking man just talk like the talking pays me\nAnd all my Gs look fly and young and that's why the olders hate me\nBut them man old and broke, no them man old and lazy\nNo them man still do draws, they shoulda got a night job at Sainsbury's\nYou put that girl in Chanel, and spent 450 on her kicks\nAnd then I link that girl 2 roads away, I can't show that cattie where I live\nNo I don't reply, I don't need to\nAnd girls are calling me a prick\nBut I can tell you from experience, nice guys never win\nAnd I'll have love for my girlfriend\nBut I've got nothing for a chick, can't trust that girl with a shh nah nah I'm expecting her to snitch\n\n[Hook]\nI grew up in estates, feds watching my face\nI'm masked up on the move, I need money in the bank like Kane\nLook, man took so many different risks on so many different days\nWhen I coulda been dead, I coulda been rich, I coulda been locked in a cage\nI grew up in estates, feds watching my face\nI'm masked up on the move, I need money in the bank like Kane\nLook, man took so many different risks on so many different days\nWhen I coulda been dead, I coulda been rich\nI coulda been locked in a cage", "year": "2016-09-30"}], "artist": "Dave"}
