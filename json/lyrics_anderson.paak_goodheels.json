What I'm 'posed to say?\nYou gon' get me killed, I'ma catch a fade\nShe'll be home soon, yeah, she'll be on the way\nI just hit the 1, shit, I'm in the Palisades\nYou gon' have to pull up, uh, the fire escape, uh\nOpen up the window, get your little thangs\nGet your little keys, get your little rings\nJust free in the wind, though, before she see your face"}]}
