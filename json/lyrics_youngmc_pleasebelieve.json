{"songs": [{"title": "Please Believe", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nNow, I'm an audiophile kicking audio files\nWho started as a baby as an audio child\nI got behind the mic to show my audio style\nThen I flipped the script to make the audio wow\nMy flow will make the girlies give a sexy smile\nCause they know this bro will go the extra mile\nWhen I'm not onstage, I keep a low profile\nBut I still kick a verse because I'm versatile\nSo your head starts boppin' and your toes could tap\nOr whatever other body movement goes with that\nOther rappers come around with the flows they chat\nBut they don't measure up to mine, and yo, I told them that\nEvery stage I stood and every seat I sat\nHad a mic in my hand with something sweet I spat\nCause it's just cool like that, I lyrically achieve\nAnd I'mma give it to ya proper, baby, please believe\n\n[Hook]\nI'mma give it to you proper, baby, please believe\nI got nice flow and oxygen you need to breathe\nLotta other brothers rapping, don't you be deceived\nBecause I'm gonna make you clap before you see me leave\nI'mma give it to you proper, baby, please believe\nI got nice flow and oxygen you need to breathe\nLotta other brothers rapping, don't you be deceived\nBecause I'm gonna make you clap before you see me leave\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow, I paid my dues, sacrificed a lot\nTo make sure these flows come out nice and hot\nWanna count me out? My advice: should not\nBecause I ain't in the mood to sacrifice my spot\nI didn't make no plan or devise some plot\nI simply made the call to give all I got\nYo, and some of these cats don't deserve their slot\nBecause they got global warming and they still ain't hot\nSee, hip hop music's like a part of my soul\nLike a part that's dominating and its taking control\nCause I see a lot of actors that be faking the role\nAnd the part that they be faking is what's making me whole\nSee, they're banking on the fact we're singing rap on a row\nBut neglect how the effect of putting rap in a hole\nRappers missing the goal, I won't be naive\nYo, I'mma give it to ya proper, baby, please believe\n\n[Hook]\nI'mma give it to you proper, baby, please believe\nI got nice flow and oxygen you need to breathe\nLotta other brothers rapping, don't you be deceived\nBecause I'm gonna make you clap before you see me leave\nI'mma give it to you proper, baby, please believe\nI got nice flow and oxygen you need to breathe\nLotta other brothers rapping, don't you be deceived\nBecause I'm gonna make you clap before you see me leave\n\n[Verse 3]\nPlease believe that my rhymes ain't gentle\nDefeat the comp or stay complimental\nAnd none of these incidents are incidental\nWhen I bust my rhyme over the instrumental\nMental, physical, lyrical flow\nI let you know the dealie if you really don't know\nAnd if you actin' silly, then its really gon' show\nCause they got the pedigree to see it's really gon' blow\nYo, I been doing this right here for way back\nI paid dues, now its the time for payback\nI'm stepping up, I got no time to lay back\nSo if you miss a line, press rewind to playback\nAnd give yourself a present like it's Christmas Eve\nCause I got a little something for ya up my sleeve\nYo, forget about the notions that were preconceived\nCause I'mma give it to ya proper, baby, please believe\n\n[Hook]\nI'mma give it to you proper, baby, please believe\nI got nice flow and oxygen you need to breathe\nLotta other brothers rapping, don't you be deceived\nBecause I'm gonna make you clap before you see me leave\nI'mma give it to you proper, baby, please believe\nI got nice flow and oxygen you need to breathe\nLotta other brothers rapping, don't you be deceived\nBecause I'm gonna make you clap before you see me leave\nI'mma give it to you proper, baby, please believe\nI got nice flow and oxygen you need to breathe\nLotta other brothers rapping, don't you be deceived\nBecause I'm gonna make you clap before you see me leave\nI'mma give it to you proper, baby, please believe\nI got nice flow and oxygen you need to breathe\nLotta other brothers rapping, don't you be deceived\nBecause I'm gonna make you clap before you see me leave", "album": "Relentless", "year": "2008-08-01", "image": "https://images.genius.com/08c3be4c0ddd7a7107b37d924261e3a0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young MC"}
