This one is dedicated to Wu-Tang, Staten Island, all of my fans. Straight up and down. Brooklyn where I was born at the Jewish hospital. And 'errebody who said I wasn't gonna make it. This one is for you! Let's go, yo. Check it out (Let's get it)\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen at the night of the party when all through the crib\nAnother MC was there, no bitch my can share\nThe toolies was hung by the bushes with care\nJust hoping that some static would soon fill the air\nThe posse would form a face with our dreads\nWhile visions of fly girls danced in they heads\nWith some cream in the rentals, and others on feet\nThey shout it and chant it and call it OG\nOG, OG, OG, OG\nL-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-lounging\nL-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-lounging\nL-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l- now\nWhile was at the age of 18 I was an MC fiend\nNeed a rehabilitation to release my steam\nI've been rhyming so long and now I'm finally home\nAnd I ain't saying I'm the best but I've never been told it, yo\nI'm a cool poet, not an alcoholic\nRhyme is so correct take a week to install it\nYou could call my brother say [?]\n[?]\nMy name is Cappa [?]\n[?]"}]}
