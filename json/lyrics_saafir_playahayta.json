Open it up\nOh...not\nThe same as mine, not the same ass\nRhyme\nNickel plated statements with nickel\nPlated\nKnuckle faded faces. No matter what\nThe Race is I hope ya cockpit got shit\nI stock\nHits. Inventory glorious. I owe me this\nI'm on my homies shit - the homeless\nShown\nThis skill is real when I attack from\nThe\nBack I'll say a rhyme then pull your\nSpinal\nCord from your torso, more so or\nBetter\nYet more or less it's not an option\nI'm coppin'\nA plea seizing a shop and hopin' a\nCop's\nA blow of the past. If not, I'll be\nBlowin'\nHis ass away. J. Groove is on the cross, I'm\nThe heavyweight fader of a playa\nHayta\n\nAnalysis is deep, forever on the peep\nAnd I'm\nThe best, the crest of the ho shit...\nYeah\nYou can't manifest destiny unless it's\nMe\nOh, you don't approve of my moves\nBut I'm not\nStarvin' for jargon, so save it\nMy libido is\nThe needle to the wax, I like to tax in\nGazebos, surviving like a mac king\nClever\nNever lacking when I'm stacking\nEndeavors\nI try and try to tell fools, that I've been\nThrough hell and my tools ain't the same\nAs yours. Coors Light that's what\nThey're\nDrinkin', must be I'm wrong yours is\nRight\nThat's why you're sinkin' in your own\nSight\nNose is in my business, witnessin'\nYour\nOwn fate, drownin' in your own lake\nOf hate\nBut I don't see no abstinent crabs in it\nPerverse perpin' after the salt I can\nHear the rehearsal of a serpent\nUrgent\nCause you don't use your head when\nYou\nShed skin - dead end...for a playa\nHayta\n\nCharades, are played but I keep\nGetting it in\nLarge amounts because I be doin'\nThese Hoogies' charge account like a banker\nI'm patient and I be waiting like an\nAnchor\nTo spank her. Then I get the softy\nSanka\nCoffee drinkin' breath stinkin'\nCheddar cheese\nEatin' wheat germ, checker board\nPants\nWearin' can't dance, and you're starin' in\nMy grill. But you had a steak\nA nervous\nTwitch and you're a badly fake and I\nHeard\nHis bitch is gettin' around like 2Pac\nServin' niggas two at a time like she\nGot\nTwo cocks. New blocks she be conquering\nZip codes, I rip ho's that be lappin' up\nMark ass lames then charge it to the\nGame. So he next time you step to\nMe\nLike a defense attorney, Ha!...I'll\nFade ya\nCause you're a playa hayta\n\nFrom a real playa ' cause I play the\nGame\nThe same, not behind no dame, so\nYou\nCan get these thangs", "album": "Boxcar Sessions"}], "artist": "Saafir"}
