Can I, baby?\nYeah, can I, baby? Can I, baby?\n\n[Verse: Drake & Beyonc\u00e9]\nCan I bring you to the six where I really stay, baby?\nShow you why I am the way I am\nCan I tell you what I think my biggest flaw is, baby?\nI try to be consistent, but I can't\nCan I have an honest moment wit' you right now, baby?\nTell me who the fuck you want to be\nCan I get an honest answer from you right now, baby?\n'Cause all we ever talk about is me\nCan I? Before I turn the lights out\n'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be\nCan I call instead of text you on the hotline?\nSometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice\nCan I see you right now, I know the sun is up, baby?\nSorry, I don't really have a choice\nCan I ever make you feel like I'm down for you, baby?\nYou do so much more than that for me\nCan I finally take the time and open up to you, baby?\n'Cause that's the side you never get to see\nCan I? Before I turn the lights out one more time\n'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be\n\n[Outro: Drake & Beyonc\u00e9]\nCan I, baby? Can I? Before I turn the lights out\nCan I, baby? Can I, baby?\nCan I, baby? Can I, baby?\nCan I? Before I turn the lights out\nTell me who the fuck you wanna be\nCan I? Can I, baby?\nCan I, baby? Can I, baby?\nCan I? Before I turn the lights out one more time\nTell me who the fuck you wanna be\nBefore I turn the lights out"}]}
