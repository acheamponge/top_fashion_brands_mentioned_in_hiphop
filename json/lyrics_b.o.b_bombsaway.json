{"songs": [{"year": "2012-04-26", "lyrics": "[Intro: Morgan Freeman]\nAs the war between light and darkness continues\nHeroes and villains become harder to identify\nKindred spirits separated at birth\nFighting for their place in time to be solidified\nThe clock ticks faster and faster\nWhile time runs a marathon in this Babylon\nBut see, the end is only the beginning\nThe beginning of the calm before the storm\n\n[Verse 1: B.o.B]\nI used to dream of success, now success is inadequate\nIt seems the bigger I get it's the more they get mad at me\nCause there ain't no rules inside this fight that we battling\nAnd it ain't no leftover scraps, you only eat if you capture it\nAnd I swear it's like a fucked up reality\nBut creation needs a devil, the devil needs an advocate\nI guess, and I ain't too big on duality but\nYou think you know me? You ain't seen the half of me\nSo fly: no gravity, so high: Mount Everest\nAnd the show must go on, yes, but I don't have to act in it\nAnd they don't make a television that handles the frequencies\nOf my channel and there ain't no computer that can hack it\nIt just don't have the capacity, hell nah, that ain't happening\nYou hustle? Well we are Grand Hustle, nigga we mastered it\nY'all working on your bachelors, we ball like the athletes\nDrink wine out of chalices on Sunday like we catholics\nAnd if this is an embassy, consider me ambassador\nOfficial, no artificial preservatives or additives\nI love it all but I ain't attached to it\nThey call this a game because it is exactly\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nWhenever I wake up, I get this feeling\nThat I can't wait up, cause time is ticking\nBombs away (Bombs away)\nWhenever I wake up, I get this feeling\nThat I can't wait up, cause time is ticking\nBombs away (Bombs away)\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nAnd it seems like in the grand scheme of it all\nThe world's run by a few people and we never seen them at all\nHow do they exist if we don't know who they are?\nThey can be you, they could be me, they could be queens and gods\nSome say that we're slaves, an alien race created us all\nFrom a distant star, some say through evolution we evolve\nBut if anything, what you finna see is a change, don't be alarmed\nAnd whoever they are, well I think that it's time we start takin' charge\nFuck rules, fuck bars, you can be whatever you want\nYou could be a star with a car with a house made out of gold\nAnd in the springs, on the falls, you could never see it all\nIf you don't know what I mean, have you seen Niagara Falls?\nMan I swear this world is ours, but I've just been pushed too far\nNow I be beasting up on these bars\nFreak out a beat and then beat it out raw\nGood God, if I go this hard, by the time I'm ninety\nI won't need viagra nah, even if I had a dog\nI be the canine, I'd have a ball\nBetter watch out when you cross my yard\nI am a flame, I am the spark\nI am in drive, y'all are in park\nLook at my shot, look at the arc\nLook at the crowd as soon as I start\nLook in they eyes and look in they hearts\nTwo middle fingers straight at the law\nSincerely yours, so pray to your lord\nCause this is a war, ain't talkin' 'bout bullets and swords\nUFOs don't make any noise\nWhen they travel in hyper speed, so welcome aboard\n\n[Hook: B.o.B]\nWhenever I wake up, I get this feeling\nThat I can't wait up, cause time is ticking\nBombs away (Bombs away)\nWhenever I wake up, I get this feeling\nThat I can't wait up, cause time is ticking\nBombs away (Bombs away)\n\n[Outro: Morgan Freeman]\nAs the mask of deception falls off the face of humanity\nUnveiling the grim reality of duality\nIn which everyone is a casualty, no one will be exempt\nTruth has many shades\nIt's not a matter of black and white, but gray\nAlthough many, we are one, so in the final analysis\nCould it be that we are fighting a war that can't be won?", "title": "Bombs Away", "album": "Strange Clouds", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5a3389828b8e82878033f8e842711c94.540x540x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
