You're gonna stay with drama\nEvery girl want a man if they ain't got one\nSo I keep problems for some hoes that I dated that was very outdated\nNow you're chasing me around the car like Diddy\nCalling up my dog pimping up these hoes crazy\nAnd your girl shady\nShe's gonna say she loved but we all but she hated\nJust to look you up with some niggas to play me\nSo she can say you ain't better than none of them\nGo save yourself shawty be one of them\nWe had to separate to be one again\nCross the finish line to run again\nHere we go once again\nGoing thru my phone like you work at Sprint\n\n[Chorus 2]\nHow many couples in here tonight\u00a0?\nOk thank you come again\nRiri said bae unfaithful\nAnd Bey said I'm replacable\nAnd you bump that shit all day long\nHow else I'm supposed to take it tho\nHow else I'm supposed to take it tho\nI mean how I supposed to take it tho\nHow else I'm supposed to take it tho\nI mean how I supposed to take it\n\n[Outro]\nYou know what I'm saying\nYou hear me\nYou learn a lot from fucking music my nigga\nI'm telling you, you hear me\nMusic controls the world man\nMusic controls everybody, music make niggas get out there and trap all day\nMusic can make your girl fuck your best friend if the song sounds good enough\nBelieve that, you hear me\nFuk Da Fame, yeah, Ha\nFire on the track nigga, you hear me\u00a0?\nAmerican trappstar shit man, Rida Gang\nFuck trying we're doing"}]}
