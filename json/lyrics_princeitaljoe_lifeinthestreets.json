I know what you're all thinking\nThat this is some old Janet Jackson type of @#!\nBut it ain't about that\nThis if the real, the street life trauma\n\nYo, I grew up rough in the streets of Boston, Massachusetts\nLived real ruthless, a wild kid, out to get a bid\nDid some #@! that he never shoulda did\nHad to learn the hard way\nThat some day you gotta pay\nSo what the hey, I say\n\nPrince Ital Joe:\nLife in the streets ain't easy\nAll I see is pain and misery\nI kneel and pray for the betrayed\nStrength and protection to survive in the society\n\nThis is the life in the streets\nAnd that's how we live it\n\nMarky Mark:\nHard and mean at sixteen, livin' like a beam, theme\nOut scheming for the green\nQuick to kill, I gets ill, I make ya blood spill\nI cut ya throat for your goose-down coat\n'cause statistic show that kids with no dough\nAin't got no chance, got nowhere to go\nThat's why life on the streets is like a trifular beat\nIt'll echo in ya head till you're dead on the concrete\n\nPrince Ital Joe:\nLife in the streets is a mystery\nDon't know my friends from my enemies\nUp to lot, could be trouble\nBut I'll hold tight and I will never give up the fight\n\n(Chorus)\nThis one is dedicated to all the homeless people\nTo every youth that's growin' up on the streets\nYou know, we're living for a dream one day\nThat there'll be no more homeless people in the world\nLife in the streets is not easy", "year": null}]}
