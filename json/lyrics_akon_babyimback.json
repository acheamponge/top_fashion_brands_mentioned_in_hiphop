(Yeah)\nBaby I'm back (yeah)\nI know\nI'm here to cater to you (any thing that you want me to I'll do it)\nCause I'll be your lover (I'll be your lover)\nI'll be your best friend\nTell me what I gotta do (tell me what I gotta do and I'll do it)\n\n[Baby Bash]\nNow I'm back in the flesh\nFeelin' so blessed, back in your corner sugar, sugar don't stress\nForget about the rest; let's go inside, I'm back in your zone\nBaby I'm back in your vibe, now I can't be denied I can lie I'm on ya\nI never ever wanna say \"Sayonara\"\nSomebody told me that the grass was greener\nOn the other side andale arriba\nNever really intended on being a cheater\nWhat I gotta do to be your keeper\nThese words comin' out the speaker, true love is off the meter\n\n[Akon]\nDon't look no farther! (Yeah)\nBaby I'm back (yeah)\nI know\nI'm here to cater to you (any thing that you want me to I'll do it)\nCause I'll be your lover (I'll be your lover)\nI'll be your best friend\nTell me what I gotta do (tell me what I gotta do and I'll do it)\n\n[Baby Bash]\nI was gone for a minute but now I'm home\nPlease forgive me for being a rolling stone\nPlease forgive me let me polish it up like chrome\nGet off the phone till he swears to leave you alone\nLet me spark your interest, now there's no more dating on the internet\n'Cause you already know how I get it wet, how I keep it so saucy and I get respect\nYou don't have to look no farther, you dealin' with the whole enchilada\nYou don't have to look no farther, you hotter then a fire starter\n\n[Akon]\nDon't look no farther! (Yeah)\nBaby I'm back (yeah)\nI know\nI'm here to cater to you (any thing that you want me to I'll do it)\nCause I'll be your lover (I'll be your lover)\nI'll be your best friend\nTell me what I gotta do (tell me what I gotta do and I'll do it)\n\n[Baby Bash]\nI was gone for a minute, (oooohhh)\nI was gone for a minute, (oooohhh)\nI was gone for a minute, (oooohhh)\nI was gone for a minute, (oooohhh)\nNow I'm back let me hit it (oooohhh)\nNow I'm back let me hit it (oooohhh)\nNow I'm back let me hit it (oooohhh)\nNow I'm back let me hit it (oooohhh)\n\n[Akon]\nDon't look no farther!
