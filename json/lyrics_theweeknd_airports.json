They want what I'm sippin' on\nThey don't want my love, they just want my potential\nFuck it, I'll keep sippin' on this, baby livin' off of this\nGot me drownin' in your love, you got me drownin' in abyss\nGive me wet attention, I'll start drowning from my wrists, wrist\n\nAnd baby if you need a little more\nThe feelings I would give to you\nYou, you, you, you\nThe feelings I would give to you\nYou, you, you, you, you, you, you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3cd68c66d12d757c908ddbdcefb581e8.441x441x1.jpg", "album": null, "title": "Airports"}]}
