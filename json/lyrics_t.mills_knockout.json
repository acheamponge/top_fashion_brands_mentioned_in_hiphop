Mills and Captain Midnite on the beat\nThe Finders Keeper EP\n\nAnd yo I'm doin' it solo like Hans\nUnique over beats so you know I drop bombs\nBitch look me up, tattoos in my palms\nSo I'm gettin wetter than a fish in a pond\nBut I play it safe, always wear a condom\nLifestyles tend to break so I rock Magnums\nYo I ain't from the bay but I make her go dumb\nShe said Mills I ain't gonna stop till I make you cum\n\nYou can love me or you can hate me\nYou can fuck me or you can date me\nCall me asshole or call me baby\nI don't really care it's all the same thing\n\nYou can love me or you can hate me\nYou can fuck me or you can date me\nCall me asshole or call me baby\nI don't really care it's all the same thing\n\nI got a style so pure it'll leave your face numb\nHigh off my lines over snare and bass drums\nHooked to my hooks you can't help but listen\nAnd everything's better with some kush in my system\nIf life is a bitch then I got a trophy wife\nAnd I just wanna get some cut like a knife\nHey girl what's up for tonight\nCause I wanna see what it's like from the inside\n\nYou can love me or you can hate me\nYou can fuck me or you can date me\nCall me asshole or call me baby\nI don't really care its all the same thing\n\nYou can love me or you can hate me\nYou can fuck me or you can date me\nCall me asshole or call me baby\nI don't really care its all the same thing"}], "artist": "T.
