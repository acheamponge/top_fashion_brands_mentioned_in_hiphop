Dance with me\nIf I shed a tear, would you cry with me?\nAnd if I told a lie would you forgive me?\n\n[Bridge 1]\nAll of these things I\u2019d do for you\nGive me a chance to prove to you\nMy love is true\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf I had to go would you leave with me?\nSaid if I had to go, go, would you leave with me?\nIf I had no food would you cook for me? Cook for me\nIf I told a joke, would you laugh with me?\nAnd if I asked for you to change, would you change for me?\n\n[Bridge 2]\nAll of these things I\u2019d do for you\nGive me a chance to prove to you\nAll of these things I\u2019d do for you\nGive me the chance to prove to you\nMy love is true\n\n[Outro]\nIf I had to die would you pray for me?\nSaid if I had to die, die, would you pray for me?", "title": "If I", "album": "Good Things"}], "artist": "Aloe Blacc"}
