(nah)\nThese stranger things ain't change they sting\nThis wall ain't lost its lights\nMy riders win and own ya (word)\nYour riders like Winona (huh)\nMy lines are meant for stoners and drinkers with inked personas (haha)\nAnother shot straight from Oaxaca\nI could stop lock like a mean popper\nThey just shot block like they Ibaka\nI just keep on cause I'm programmed\nLike a good ol' fashioned teen bopper\nBut I'm still stuck in this dream locker\nI don't know nuttin'' but to be proper, man\n\n[Hook] [x2]\nIn the middle of the night\nI stay up late and I write\n(Why you stay up all night?)\nI don't know, it just feels so right\n'Cause there's people feeling sleepy\nAnd they been resting easy\nBut everything I do I do it\nIn the middle of the night\n\n[Verse 2:]\nNight time is the right time\nTo get you a couple of them lifelines\nI been on the night train since 9 9\nHaving brunch with the goblins\nI mean birds have been super for the gobbling\nDigest and I'm ready for the problems\nThat we all in\nWhen the sun comes right back up and there ain't no stoppin'\nBreak bread\nMatter of fact go ahead break eggs\nCause when your family is gathered around in the pantry\nI'll probably just stay dead\nThat's my steez if you must make beds\nMake 'em around me or make late check\nImma be the guy that you can't wake yet\nOnly been asleep since the bass faded\nI been chasing the dreams outta every day\nJust to find me the right night line\nAnd if you can't get sleep 'cause you hearin' the beats\nThen you might have a life like mine\nLife goes fast, takes things slow\nTime does pass, grey hairs grow\nI can't grasp where I can go\nUnless I see the stars, so\n\n[Hook] [x2]\nIn the middle of the night\nI stay up late and I write\n(Why you stay up all night?)\nI don't know, it just feels so right, 'cause\nThere's people feeling sleepy\nAnd they been resting easy\nBut everything I do I do it\nIn the middle of the night", "title": "Middle of the Night", "year": "2017-05-05", "album": "Into the Further", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6f3dc8fd85f67bd995f87b15cb9bb3a1.1000x1000x1.jpg"}]}
