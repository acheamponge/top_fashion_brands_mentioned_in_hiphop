'Cause we takin'\nTakin' mad trips to foreign lands\nThey ain't even on vacation\nWhole scenery change, new greenery, strange\nCouple mamis and bikinis to flame\nOnly MV I fuck with, jeeps are stridden\nIt's gold time, no time for the foolishness\nWho run it\n\n[Verse 3: Streetlife]\nWe run it\nRebel I engage the call all morning\nPull up curbside on your block, who on it?\nHop out, guns drawn, nigga, you runnin'?\nNobody move, or catch tubes to your stomach\nWhile you talk about what you gonna do, we done it\nThis is nothing new to me, it's getting redundant (runnin')\nWho run it? You run from it, America's Most Wanted\nStill gunnin', I stayed flooded\nStreetlife, I spray hell's fire, I'm a known Arson\nI got mad priers, call niggas out like umpires\nYou's a damn liar, you didn't shoot, it was a misfire\nWe run these streets like car tires\nYou just squire in your own empire, you's a dick rider\n(runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin')\n\n[Outro]\nThe Wu-Tang were naturally enraged and they challenged Shaolin but all the other temples, they mediated. Our chief, Abbot, as a gesture of peace had to withdraw Shaolin. So Wu-Tang took\nShaolin's place. And after that, they became number one.
