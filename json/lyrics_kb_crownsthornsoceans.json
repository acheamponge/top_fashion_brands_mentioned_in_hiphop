Become the servant of all?\nWhen you the servant of all, no competition's involved\n'Cause who is knocking you off? There's nowhere left to fall (Uh)\nProgressive with the flow, that's a little one\nAs I'm insured, I'm sure you're missing these little puns\nI'm insured, yeah, the settlement is finna come\nHe's still shining if I'm jacked for every nickel, son\n'Cause no way I'ma die slow, no way I'ma die slow\nWon't break, I will not fold, cancel my tour, not my soul\nI'll go blindfold in and out of time zones\nI'm in my zone, put it up on your iPhone\nLeaving your mind blown, looking for His arrival\nI can see Him ridin' down all on that white horse\nLooking like OJ in the bronco, uh\nAnd I'm learning when I've flown\nFlights make my respect much stronger, uh\nThe higher that I go in grace, everything below is smaller\nI'ma steward this well\nHe holds my airways, I breathe with a heavy flow\nForevermore, yes I'm willing and able like I'm sittin' in an exit row\nI gotta make an exit though\nWhat will they remember though?\nHow I was born? How 'bout my metaphors?\nMan of war standin' in truth and I was serving strong\nBring it, they can throw violence\nI'm in the back grinnin' like Joe Biden\nHe rose the ocean, Poseidon\nTo be frank, no ocean I won't dive in\n\n[Chorus: Taya Smith]\nSpirit lead me where my trust is without borders\nLet me walk upon the waters\nWherever you would call me\nTake me deeper than my feet could ever wander\nAnd my faith will be made stronger\nIn the presence of my Savior\nSpirit lead me where my trust is without borders\nLet me walk upon the waters\nWherever you would call me\nTake me deeper than my feet could ever wander\nAnd my faith will be made stronger\nIn the presence of my Savior"}], "artist": "KB"}
