Bone Crusher)\n\n[T-Pain]\nKonvict Muzic... it's time to do it\nI can't handle all these bills and payments\nThis stuff is overstressin me (but I still gotta do it)\nBaby mama put me on them papers and get nothing for the baby (but I still gotta do it)\nI can't keep on working, (keep on working)\nSeems like the whole world's ignoring me (but I still gotta do it)\nSchemers keep on dirking (keep on dirking)\nEverybody's getting more than me (but I still gotta do it)\n\n[Chorus]\nSo pass that drag, pass that dro, it's my life\nSo what you think, what you know?\nYes all right and I paid the price, but still I'm\nGoing thru a lot, sittin on the block now\nThru a lot, slangin out my drop now\nThru a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not\nGoing thru a lot, I'm hittin on the cops now\nThru a lot, wishin they would stop now\nThru a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not\n\n[T-Pain]\nAll this music got me going crazy\nCan't even concentrate on my family (but I still gotta do it)\nPlus I gotta go thru all this family hatred\nI don't know why everybody's hatin me (but I still gotta do it)\nEven one of my homeboys thinking that I'm bangin his lady\nI don't know why he would think that outta me (but he gotta go thru it)\nTo all the nappy headz I got you baby\nWe bout make it yes indeed (and we gon get thru it)\n\n[Chorus]\n[Bone Crusher]\nI work a nine to five shawty and they think it's funny\nAnd how they feel that my stress don't count homie\nI hit the beat like a cop when I hit the block\nBecause my baby's gotta eat, I ain't gon never stop\nI see them laughin at me fo cuz my pants red\nAnd my do' won't shut and my car's shabby\nBut I see the future man like I'm nostradamus\nAnd in my heart all I see is a future star\nBut in my brain ain't nothing but these notes man\nBut ya'll don't feel my stress ya'll don't understand\nThe next step is my pistol and it goes down\nWiggle it out fat boy just calm down\nAnd sing this song, and sing that song\nCause god gon make a way for me to get my hustle on\n\n[T-Pain]\nGoing thru a lot, sittin on the block now\nThru a lot, slangin out my drop now\nThru a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not\nGoing thru a lot, I'm hittin on the cops now\nThru a lot, wishin they would stop now\nThru a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not\n[x2]\nGoing thru a lot, thru a lot, thru a lot\nGoing thru a lot, thru a lot, thru a lot"}], "artist": "T-Pain"}
