to the sky\nThought about 100 things to do before I die\nHit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right\nAnd my family live that life\nLa-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky\nThought about 100 things to do before I die\nWonderin\u2019 if I could live it all in one life\nCause it could all end in one night\nLa-la-lahhh\nLa-la-lahhh\nLa-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky\nI thought about 100 things to do before I die\n\n[Verse 1: Big Sean]\nCouple niggas on the hitlist and bitches on a different type\nSame shit different nights, till I live a different life\n\"Sean you looking tired\", damn homie that\u2019s all?\nI\u2019ve been stressin\u2019 so hard I\u2019m surprised I ain't going bald\nHaters praying I fall, move back in with my moms\nTake online classes and turn back into y'all, hatin\u2019\nI guess they want your lights out when you the plug\nNiggas wanna catch you slippin' like they pulled the rug\nFrom where they move the drugs, Buddha love\nNiggas sleepin' with that mac and I ain't talkin\u2019 'bout computer love\nOwe the wrong people you a price tag\nNow you pray to God hoping that you got a Christ tag\nMake it where I\u2019m from, stay who I become\nTime to raise hell, Satan ain't my son\nTaking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view\nAnd have the fam there too, uhh\n\n[Chorus: Big Sean]\nAs I look up to the sky\nThought about 100 things to do before I die\nHit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right\nAnd my family live that life\nLa-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky\nThought about 100 things to do before I die\nWonderin\u2019 if I could live it all in one life\nCause it could all end in one night\nLa-la-lahhh\nLa-la-lahhh\nLa-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky\nI thought about 100 things to do before I die\n\n[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]\nIf I just stop breathing\nEven though I got all this muthafucking money\nWon't keep my heart beating\nJust don\u2019t wake me up\nDon't wake me up\nYou can\u2019t catch me dreaming\nBout all of this muthafucking money\nCocaine rush, I\u2019m speeding\nCocaine rush\n\n[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9\"]\nI\u2019m just a Detroit nigga, nothing extra about me\nI go extra hard at the first second you doubt me\nI strive for perfection at the same time, I\u2019m accepting\nThe fact that there\u2019ll never be nothing perfect about me\nShit, I\u2019m just waiting on a win\nCome up with better hooks, the hoes\u2019ll take it on the chin\nWe are 6 Mile bred, that's why you see our sick style yeah\nCrackhouse flow with a pit downstairs\nMomma happy at me, daddy happy at me\nThe baddest chicks' y'all can imagine is chatty yapping at me\n5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon\nNow I\u2019m Cali swagging\nHuh, my nigga listen, I\u2019m over the fame\nYou number 1, I\u2019m number 23, my mission is take over the game\nYou rollin\u2019 with lames, we ain't rolling the same\nI\u2019m the best out in this muthafucker\nIf I could get a check out of this muthafucka\nBig enough to set my kids up for life\nI could check out of this muthafucka with no regrets\nIf you ain't living your life for your kids, I ain't giving yo ass no respect\nSean I love you, my nigga, I\u2019m out\n\n[Chorus: Big Sean]\nAs I look up to the sky\nThought about 100 things to do before I die\nHit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right\nAnd my family live that life\nLa-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky\nThought about 100 things to do before I die\nWonderin\u2019 if I could live it all in one life\nCause it could all end in one night\nLa-la-lahhh\nLa-la-lahhh\nLa-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky\nI thought about 100 things to do before I die\n\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nI gotta break your fucking heart\nI gotta climb these fucking charts (I gotta climb 'em)\nI gotta do something that\u2019s innovative\nCreative just to create a legacy before death do us part\nI gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia\u2019s momma\nBreakfast in bed is head with plenty of Carne Asada\nI gotta, I gotta find me a wife to elope\nI got a, I got a fine, cause I ain't wanna vote\nI promise, I know the history of those who died\nFor the rights for me to survive but those who lied\nTo the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave\nI can easily pretend like y'all but that's not me\nI gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt\nThe youths need to know every detail about this Earth\nThe devil controls it, so before you scrutinize how I feel\nAsk God if them polls important, the end is near\n\n[Chorus: Big Sean]\nAs I look up to the sky\nThought about 100 things to do before I die\nHit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right\nAnd my family live that life\nLa-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky\nThought about 100 things to do before I die\nWonderin\u2019 if I could live it all in one life\nCause it could all end in one night\nLa-la-lahhh\nLa-la-lahhh\nLa-la-lahhh, as I look up to the sky\nI thought about 100 things to do before I die"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
