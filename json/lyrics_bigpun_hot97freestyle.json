Swallow the stuff\nI don't give a fuck any more, I'm only twenty-four years old\nAnd I've already broken every law\nI'm horrorcore, this is for the heads\nRunnin' up in your crib, knot if you still hot in under the bed\n\n[Verse 3]\nAy-yo I shatter dreams like Jordan, assault and batter your team\nYour squadron'll be barred from rap like Adam & Eve from the garden\nI'm carvin' my initials on your forehead\nSo every night before bed you see the \"BP\" shine off the (board head)\nReverse that, I curse at the first wack nigga with the worst rap\nCuz he ain't worth jack\nHit 'em with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap\nMake his whole body jerk back, watch the earth crack\nHand him his purse back\nI'm the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull\nMaster the flow, niggas be swearin' I'm blacker than coal\nLike Nat King, I be rappin' and tongue's packin'\nThe ones, magnums, cannons and gatlin' guns\nIt's Big Pun! The one and only son of Tony, Montana\nYou ain't promised manana in the rotten manzana\nC'mon-pana we need more rhymers\nFeel the marijuana snake bite anaconda\nI'm in Ivana with wine-a, try to match my persona\nSometimes rhymin' I blow my own mind like Nirvana\nComma, and go the whole nine like Madonna\nGo try to find another rhymer with my kinda gramma"}], "artist": "Big Pun"}
