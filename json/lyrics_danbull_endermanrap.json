Rockit!\n\n[Chorus 3: Rockit]\nYou don't want to mess with the endermen\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\nYou don't want to mess with the endermen\nNo, no, no, no, no...\n\n[Bridge: Rockit]\nDon't look me in the eye, you better run and hide\nI'm chasing after you until you die\nDeadly as a knife, beautifully designed\nI'm hunting you tonight until you die\nIt's time to tell the truth, a bomb you can't defuse\nSo easily amused to watch you die\nDon't you try to fight, you're lucky you're alive\nI have you in my sights... no, no, no, no\n\n[Verse 3: Dan Bull]\nNow you see me, now you don't\nShoving a dirt block down your throat\nYou better not be getting out your boat\nI suggest that you don't leave the house alone\nOh, no, I'm on a mission\nTo win this staring competition\nI'll let you live on just one condition\nIf you put a pumpkin upon, you're forgiven\nNo, no, no, no", "year": "2017-03-17"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
