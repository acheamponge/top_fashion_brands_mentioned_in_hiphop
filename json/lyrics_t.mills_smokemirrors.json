Why'd I get different?\"\nBut I'm not slowin down\n\nSwitch on, once I get my rich on\nI take a picture of my dick for them to put they lips on\nI ain't no fast one\nLast long\nGet up off my fashion\nHow you talking shit for stalking pics of what I have on\nDamn, change the subject\nCause lately I'm like fuck it\nBut it's funny how my haters ain't gonna say no shit in public\nI got my youngins\nAnd if you didn't hear it, it's motherfucking I'm gettin\nAnd anybody near it\nThat's the spirit\nGet too close and I will lose you\nYour mind is a powerful thing, do what you chose to\nJust to make shit a little clearer, I know some fake motherfuckers\nIt's no smoke and mirrors\n\nAll these people try to put me down\nTellin me \"you ain't gonna make, you ain't gonna make it\"\nBut I'm not breakin\nAll these people try to fool me now\nAskin me \"When we gonna kick it? Why'd I get different?\"\nBut I'm not slowin down\n\nPeople come, and people go\nI'd like to think that I did this all, on my own\nPeople come, and people go\nOh, people go\n\nAll these people try to put me down\nTellin me \"you ain't gonna make, you ain't gonna make it\"\nBut I'm not breakin\nAll these people try to fool me now\nAskin me \"When we gonna kick it? Why'd I get different?\"\nBut I'm not slowin down\n\nSmoke and mirrors\nSmoke and mirrors\nSmoke and mirrors\nSmoke and mirrors\nBut, I'm not slowin down\nSmoke and mirrors\nSmoke and mirrors\nSmoke and mirrors\nSmoke and mirrors\nBut, I'm not slowin down"}], "artist": "T.
