Ain't invincible\nNiggas talk subliminal then grab their genitals\nI don't play that shit, a different individual\nYou got me thinking criminal\nHe said ''I'm only a soldier''\nWell, good - pay your general\nOver a small thing, but let small things slide\nYou be a poor thing, then I heard\n\n[Hook: Sen City]\nMy life, my life, my life, my life\nDucking onetime\nIf you'd whipping the white you\u2019d be where I be\nIf you'd whipping the white you\u2019d be where I be\n\n[Verse 2: Cam'Ron]\nYeah, so I'm envied by most of you\nSo I don't get close to you\nStill be on Lennox, fuck am I supposed to do?\nWhen Tito fire escape - Grey Goose, Mimosa too\nNext morning, take a flight straight to my ocean view\nBy the C M beach, from my room you can see the beach\nGucci linen, see the sheets, green and peach\nChandeliers out your reach, smoking that Chong and Cheech\nTwo girls in thongs Dawn and Keish, off the leash\nI'm trying my best to be discrete\nI'm trying my best to leave the streets (I am)\nBut I got some hungry niggas and they need to eat\nOh shit, you see the chief? (There he go)\n\n[Hook]"}]}
