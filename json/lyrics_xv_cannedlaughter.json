Never been called that\nSquarian ether don\u2019t play this close to the heater\nPut some water in the tray and just place inside the freezer\nTake it out when you\u2019ve made that follower a leader\nThen throw ice cubes down for the nicest emcee up\n\n[Verse 1: XV]\nUnbelievable L7 believer\nSince I was next to seven that night that I held the receiver\nI\u2019m in LA taking a breather when the twins stopped breathing\nThen I made square in the circle to get over the grieving\nOr when my grandma passed, and I just kept dreaming\nThat she was like, right there and I just kept reaching\nBut couldn\u2019t reach it, that\u2019s the reason Imma\u2019 shine til she sees it\nOr til I make it to heaven, and ask \u201cgrandma you see it?\u201d believe it\n\n[Hook: XV]\n\n[Verse 2: XV]\nBiggie\u2019s demon, I took a weekend to let it sink in\nRefraining from reaching, the mind state Chris Lighty would think in\nEating church\u2019s while my label\u2019s preaching\nThey can\u2019t reach me on the jack so instead they jack reaching\nBad reason\nHave meetings bout\u2019 tracks with wack treatments\nAnd acts that\u2019s half decent and bars that\u2019s half eaten\nLet\u2019s fact check these Rap Genius meanings when it lacks genius\nNiggas suck, like Sookie's last season. (Laughter)\n\n[Hook: XV]\n\n[Verse 3: XV]\nYou thought a square wasn\u2019t cool?\nThrew em\u2019  two ice cubes, Jay said \u201cNew Rules\u201d\nMight bring back jerry curl juice with this fro like Fudge\nHigher learning like the view of a Dead Poet standing on his chair inside a school\nTaking shots off the top, like Remy on the roof\nScreaming fuck niggas\nI hope you got Aflac, Duck nigga, cuz\u2019 here comes the attack\nSmooth as orange Julius Caesar under my snapback\nGat strap for niggas that be thirsty for an @ back\nThat\u2019s that, the roots to the square that I am\nUsed to rap like 50 cent, now I wrap 100\u2019s in bands\nThe real square root of a key, is 32 grams\nBut when did I expect these dudes to tell the truth to their fans huh?\nMust have forgot where I am\nThe kid with the green backpack is back to the plan\nSo when I hear these punch lines about squares from these rap niggas\nThey\u2019re the first to remind me, don\u2019t rap like the last nigga\nI heard this game is like handling dope\nSo the 10 Crack Commandments is the shit that I quote\nI learned you can\u2019t fix the game if you end up broke\nAsk Nas, he made Ether, now that camel\u2019s the goat\nSo if you take their breath away, keep your hands on their throat\nSquarian ether, that\u2019s a more fatal of dose\n\n[Hook: XV]"}], "artist": "XV"}
