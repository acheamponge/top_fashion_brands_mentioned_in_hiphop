Guts in the drain\nSiccmade niggas, they make the world go round\nAnd if you fuck with Siccmade Music you can get your ass gunned down\n\n(Phonk Beta):\nI had a homie who stayed up in Alaska (what he used to do?)\nUsed to transfer flights over Nebraska\nAnd flew me back about a ounce of that Alaska indica weed\nAnd out of the whole zip possessed one seed\nHad it wrapped real tight all up in cellophane\nCan't have the K-9 dogs smell it, man\nIf only you saw what I was seein', the buds was almost pure white, but not green\nHad to be one of those one-hitter quitter dome splitters\nIt's the type a tweed that makes you wanna fuck your babysitter\nI roll a fattie, when I roll this fattie\nNiggas'll be all 'noid wondering why they lookin at me\nBitches have the nerve to say my shit ain't bomb\nBut it'll have your lungs burning, like you're puffing on napalm\n\n(Zagg):\nI wipe that sweat up off my forehead, I'm off the kush\nLay back and take a comfortable hit, with a Q-tip, it's splitting my lips\nAnd my dome stays split off toothpicks\nI hit a lick with a quickness, dumping dead bodies in ditches\nAppreciate the fact, so come correct, cause I could be vicious\nSuspicious, comin' up on recognition I'm creepin' up from behind\nWith a 12 gauge, non-fiction, I'm all prepared to go for mine\nSo step in line, a couple of hits, dome split, I be lit on a for real basis\nWith a machete I'll slice your neck just like them Jason cases\nMurder traces, but I ain't pinned cause there's no evidence\nSlight scent of that purple kush plant, and I can almost sense the essence\nWhat's the lesson? Get tested, don't come if you can't come correct\nIt's that West Coast shit for life. I don't know what you expected\nI'm reckless, nevertheless I'm a pimp in a bulletproof vest\nPutting it down, pound and pound, you need to take a step down\n.50 caliber rounds, I'm running through your whole town\nBuckin' em down like Doom set on deathmatch with the BFG-9000 cartoon", "year": "1997-09-16", "album": "Loaded"}], "artist": "Brotha Lynch Hung"}
