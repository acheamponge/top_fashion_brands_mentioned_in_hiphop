Thug]\nBustin' out the bando (Woo)\nA nigga jewelry real metal like a can opener (Bling)\nI went from rags to riches to a feature with Tip (Woo)\nI went from Smart Card to a bitch with some smart lips (Skrrt)\nAnd the F&N make my hip limp (Gah)\nI'm goin' fishin' with these little bitty shrimp dimps (Woo)\nAnd my bank roll got a big dip (Woo)\nShe gon' bring it on a big ship (Sheesh, sheesh)\nQuite trill, no QuikTrip (Sheesh, sheesh)\nI got thugs in the alley, know Tip here (Woo)\nAnd she just wanna have a good day (What?)\nSmoke way more weed than a guy in L.A (Damn)\nDamn, I'll hold them birds 'til next May (Goddamn)\nNever let 'em fly away (What?)\nI heard, hey buddy\nListen what my nigga Tip say, hey\n\n[Chorus: T.I. & Young Thug]\nIf it ain't about the money (Yeah)\nDon't be blowin' me up, nigga, I ain't gettin' up (Brr)\nIf it ain't about the money (Hello?)\nAin't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time (Bye bruh)\nIf it ain't about the money\nNah, I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit (I ain't finna do shit, my nigga)\nIf it ain't about the money\nBitch, you can miss me with it\nBitch nigga, miss me with it, turn it (Hey, go, tell 'em)\n\n[Post-Chorus: Young Thug & T.I.]\nI pack an 11, I pack an 11, ayy (Boom, turn it)\nI'm ridin' in a gator, my shoes are Giuseppe, ooh (Turn up, uh, watcha, what they say gah)\nI'm slime like the reverend, I shoot at the reverend, ayy (Bah, uh nigga, boom what)\nPants out the grocery store, they stuffed with lettuce, ayy (Bankroll Mafia, go)\nShe try make the extras, I tell on these bitches, hey (Hustle, gah, sheesh, sheesh)\nWhen it's 'bout time to pay, I'ma bail on these bitches, ayy (Yuh, uh uh, skrrt)\n\n[Refrain: T.I.]\nAyy, ayy, ayy, what you think we in the neighborhood for?\nStandin' at the corner store with a pocket full of dough\nI'll be damned if a nigga wife a hood ho (woo)\nLearned that from UGK back in \"Pocket Full of Stones\"\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nPut your money down, I could buck a hard 4\nYou playin' with it, I'ma send 'em through your car door\nMy watch flooded, shit sick, got Parvo\nI'm doin' it for black and yellow, free Hardo\nThe head honcho, nigga, no Tonto, nigga\nI'm quick to put some bricks in a Bronco, nigga\nNiggas talk shit, well, I don't respond to no nigga\nNo murder, no dough, no convo, nigga\n\n[Chorus: T.I.]\nIf it ain't about the money\nDon't be blowin' me up, nigga, I ain't gettin' up\nIf it ain't about the money\nAin't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time\nIf it ain't about the money\nNah, I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit\nIf it ain't about the money\nBitch, you can miss me with it\nBitch nigga, miss me with it, turn it (Go, tell 'em)\n\n[Post-Chorus: Young Thug & T.I.]\nI pack

stolen car while he bang that AK\n\n[Verse 3: T.I.]\nIf you ever took a loss, better bring that back\nCatcha' with you, bet your heat will blow your brains 'bout that\nBa-bow, ayy, know you better be (better be)\nOn your best behavior when addressin' me\nBecause, bye-gones, we don't let 'em be\nNiggas disrespect me, I'ma catch a felony\nFor real, if you listen I can get you paid\nBut not interested in shit you say\n\n[Chorus: T.I.]\nIf it ain't about the money (nigga)\nDon't be blowin' me up, nigga, I ain't gettin' up\nIf it ain't about the money\nAin't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time\nIf it ain't about the money\nNah, I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit\nIf it ain't about the money\nBitch, you can miss me with it\nBitch nigga, miss me with
