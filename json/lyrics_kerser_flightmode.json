Well\nMonths later, I was checkin' into rehab\nMet some fans in there, they were like, \"I thought you're clean lad\"\nI just looked at them like, \"Yeah\" and I shrug my shoulders\nEvery minute of withdrawal's gettin' fuckin' colder\nHad the scene blamin' me like, \"You spread the Xans\"\nIt went from that to, \"Come on Kerser, we went ten for ten\"\nAnd I am meant to be the one who shows respect to them?\nThat's half the reason with the scene, I start neglectin' them\n\n[Hook]\nFall down and my mind is on flight mode\nFacin' struggles everyday, gotta fight bro\nI could be livin' different, wishin' for a ride home\nKers One, guarantee I won't die broke\nFall down, you gettin' up, it's a part of life\nAnd you're connected through the music, you a part of mine\nEveryday wakin' up like \"I made it\"\nI let it flow in God's hands, I won't change shit"}], "artist": "Kerser"}
