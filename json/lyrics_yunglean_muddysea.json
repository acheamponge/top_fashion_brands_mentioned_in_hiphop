High! You high like me?\nWhy, why they stare at me? (Sad Boys)\nFly, fly! Get fly like me (like me)\nRight, right! On time, baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nRavens guard that house, I just keep them within\nYou presume that you know me, you don't know where I've been\nTree house of horror, tryna' heal from within\nEverything is dusty, but to me is still mint\nCan't trust myself, I keep changing the shit\nKeep thinkin' back, but I don't need what I miss\nAquarium of life inside my mind, this is trip (Leandoer)\nMuch better, now I just don't understand it\n\n[Outro]\nI still love you to death, Louis V on my hip\nSnakes 'round my house and my clocks don't tick\nI still love you to death, Louis V on my hip\nSnakes 'round my house and my clocks don't tick", "title": "Muddy Sea"}]}
