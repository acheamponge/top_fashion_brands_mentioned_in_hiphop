Philadelphia's freeway\nIn the '06 with a bitch from BK that I never hit\nBitch on my dick, but she gay\nAnd I'm on tips, in West VA\nWith my whole clique running get rich relays\nNickname Bo, OT it's BJ\nBesides God, only thing I fear is D-E-A\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nMoved in next door, meet your neighbors\nWe got it sold from Evergreen to Schaffer\nDrinking R\u00e9my 'gnac sold with a chaser\nMixing Henny with the Mo getting wasted\nWith ??? girl, I post with green acres\nI been selling dope since a pre-teenager\nWith a little bit of gold and a pager\nThe scale broke, cut my finger with the razor\nBled all over the dining room table\nA fiend died, got fried hooking up the cables\nNow it's a down power line on the pavement\nHook outside, now the house getting raided\nHad to downsize and dock niggas' payments\nNow I hide inside and chop ninja ???\nOn the south side of the mall in the spaceship\nGetting daps and high-fives from the gangsters", "image": "https://images.genius.com/06f819733860ea6f65fb77cc4e85eb44.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
