For the Show\nListen\n\n[Verse 1: brandUn DeShay]\nThe dough I don\u2019t got don\u2019t mean squat like the Heisman\nNo violence to violins\nHowdy-do? How are you? How high are you? I\u2019m high as the stratosphere\nObviously the baddest here, this beat is a battlefield\nAnd I\u2019ve been praying for containment, how insane my brain gets\nIt\u2019s more than entertainment like Cedric\nBeen doing everything a little bigger like Texas\nAnd now I watch the pieces fall in place like Tetris\nAnd now I watched you niggas fall from grace like [?]\nAnd watched the stock plummet and watched you rise from it\nThe phoenix from the ashes, the teacher for the classes\nThe preacher for the masses, so lead them for the classless\nAli before the Cassius Clay, the champ without the belt\nI made it to the ring with no help\nExcuse me, you don\u2019t got to choose me to win the title fight\nBut I\u2019m gonna wear that championship belt so tight, damn right\n\n[Chorus (2x): brandUn DeShay]\nI\u2019m finna go like the starting line\nLet me show you looking at a star like a starting sign\nLow-go, hold on, hold on\nGot a hold on them, they can\u2019t hold on\n\n[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]\nI\u2019m next door like Mr. Feeny\nHoping that my skills open doors like Lamborghinis\nHoping to put my foot in the door, these niggas see me\nProps to my moms and my pops and cousin Benny\n\u2018Cause ever since a nigga was young and still teeny\nLike everything they wished I\u2019d become like I\u2019m Jeannie\nY\u2019all, you should\u2019ve seen me at the Grammy\u2019s\nOnly one album and the outcome? They was running out of awards that they can hand me\nIf that was called a dream, I live my life in jammies\n\u2018Cause right now, no Super Bowl rings, my downs hand-me\nSo many thoughts run through my mind, I pulled a handy\nAnd just as you guessed, I\u2019m fresh, I pulled a Mannie\nDamn, he done grown up so much\nUsed to didn\u2019t cuss so much, but so what\nThese other rappers never switched gears, they so huff\nI\u2019m introducing who, where, when, and why \u2018cause y\u2019all know what\n\n[Chorus (2x)]", "year": "2009-02-23", "album": "Volume: Two!
