I'm never right, I hope\nOh you, milk soft hands, oh, you, neatly combed, I'm never right, I'm never right, I hope\nI'm never right, I'm never right I hope...\nI am the one you sought I ain't around the block I've got the steady hands and a mean game of small talk\nI put my quarters up and waited for left and lesson learned\nI guess I got some questions had to just walk away\nThis is it my last game there's more than winning and losing its too late to save face\nAin't no man with strength in his hands, I'm just like you another pawn in play\nDreams where I can talk the talk and the ball is placed i love the stain felt the small chinks I love the way the chalk tastes\nI lean upon my hands stop them just before it falls away charge forward to future and watch the white ball race\nA few were set askew for one and two with six and five I couldn't believe my eyes the cue ball laid away split away into equal sides\nThe end is nigh I can feel a storm coming its the first sign, next generation of first born running the end is nigh\nI can feel a storm coming its the first sign, next generation of first borns running the end is nigh\nI can feel a storm coming its the first sign, next generations of first born running the end is nigh\nI can feel a storm coming its the first sign, next generations of first born running the end is nigh\n(There's a midnight voice and I can hear its scream, she can't live my dreams, if the sky falls asleep its all in my thought and deeds)\nMy apologies lack protection collapsed in her affection, \"naw,\" he cried\nBegging for her strength strength my dusty tears bloody, loving before this becoming, wondering if I could ever saved myself\nI felt my heart sink, I think you fell head over heels only to be let down, the stars don't seem so high and the world won't turn around, she says I'm so indifferent and I killed us both somehow\nI reply that a dying man doesn't change, but I can't continue to exist, we won't see the light of day because tomorrow is a promise\nOh you, (careless eyes) careless eyes\nOh you, (happy bones )happy bones (I am never right X3)\nOh you, (Milk-soft hands) milk-soft hands (I am never right X3)\nOh you, (Neatly combed) neatly combed I'm never right\nI'm never right, I'm never right, I'm never right, I'm never right, I hope, I'm never right I hope", "year": null}]}
