We\u2019ve got to find that shit. I want my humanity back. I want to be a human being again. I don\u2019t want this shit on my conscience no more! I want to live in a fair world. We\u2019ve got to decide to rejoin the human family again. We\u2019re not talking about just this case, we not talking about just this issue, we\u2019re talking about whether or not we\u2019re going to be human beings again\nPeace!\n\nSinging this song let the whole world know\nSinging this song let the whole world know", "year": "2012-09-18", "album": "Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color"}], "artist": "Brother Ali"}
