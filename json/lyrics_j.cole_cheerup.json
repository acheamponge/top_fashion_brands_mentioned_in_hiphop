Raised with rats and roaches\nNever liked them teachers, couldn't stand my coaches\nAsk \"what's the matter?\" but you can't relate\nLiving the life that you hate but you can't escape\nFeel like I\u2019m stuck here, that's why I don't give a fuck here\nThere's no luck here, nobody to trust here\nMy own mother, yeah I love her\nBut things I heard as a child under my covers\nLeft me with scars, it was hard to see her suffer\nDarkened my heart and I don't know if I\u2019ll recover\nI'm going under and as I'm headed out the front door\nShe said she proud of me and I wonder what for?\nAnd once more\n\n[Hook]\nEven through the joy I feel the pain\nEven in the sun I feel the rain\nEven when I\u2019m high I feel the lows\nLike that's all I know\nAnd Lord knows I can't complain\nBut even when I do it feels the same\nI\u2019m getting high just to fight the lows\nCause that's all I know\nThat's all I know, that's all I know\nThat's all I know, that's all I...\n\n[Bridge]\nHey cheer up!\nEy lil' mama, cheer up!\nYou got your whole life to live, ey why you wanna tear up?\nDon\u2019t let them lil' boy come but do some when they try push up\nHey, hey"}], "artist": "J.
