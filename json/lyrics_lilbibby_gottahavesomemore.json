Say, lemme talk to you real quick, look...\n\n[Hook: Lil Bibby]\nUh! Say, girl you fine\nI'm tryna make you mine\nI ain't tryna waste no time\nHop in my ride, got a whip parked outside\nGot a condo, we can go slide\nKnow I got pride, but I put that to the side\nTink, I need that on my side\nLook at them thighs, look at that waist (aye)\nLook at them hips (look)\nLook at that face\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]\nYeah, she know that I'm a thug, I ain't goin' on a date\nWe can smoke a lil bud, you can come to my place\nUsually after I fuck, I'll tell a hoe to skate, but shorty so bad I just want you to stay\nI'm working on a tape, I'll fly you to the A\nKnow I need that when I'm in another state\nMan, that shit a tease lookin' at yo face\nI miss yo smell, I miss yo taste\nAye, aye, look...\nI hit it, I lick it, I hit from the front, now I'm switchin' positions\nI made you a promise, I'll never go missing\nYou need me, girl watch me appear like magicians\nGirl, you the one, you got all my attention\nThe way you make that thing stand up like attention\nI beat that cat up like I'm Sonny Liston\nI say \"beat it up\" but girl, I'll never hit you\nWar with whoever\nBaby, I'm with ya\nBeef with my lady, take you out the picture\nI'll pull up dolo, I don't need my hitters\nI'll take you out like a granny with dentures\nWhen I get older, might make me a mister\nI want you with my last night like a sister\nWhat a few kids, girl, lets have a whole litter\nMore than my lady, you know you my nigga\n\n[Verse 2: Tink]\n(Yeah!)\nI think I got a real one... yeah\n(Yeah!)\nYeah... Look, Baby I'm yours\nYou ain't gotta question my love, I'm around if you need me to slide and get at you\nI love how we rock from the bottom to the top, you was here even when you didn't have to...\nBe, fuck what they see\nFucking you slow till I'm weak in my knees\nFour car garages, I put you in charge\nAnd you love how I listen, Micheal and Pippin\nTouchin' and kissin'\nI bone at you, tell me you rolling\nThat's when I show up and do work\nScratchin' ya body, you know that you got me\nWe fuck till I tell you it hurts\nThe moment I saw you, I knew we would click, and you gotta admit I was right\nThe bitch you was with wasn't never on shit, and you better with Tink in your life\nStronger than gravity, this movie deserves an academy\nI feel it when you deep inside of me\nBaddest, we just fuck on the balcony (Awh!)\nIf it's just me and you against the world\nI'ma be ya girl, I don't wanna blow it (blow it... blow it)\nCheck on the way, now we up and we winnin'\nPo' a cup and you tell me you spendin'\nI was true from the very beginning\nWe did everything that we intended\nWe a long ass way from them wild ass days when ya worked on the block\nMore than my nigga, you know you my heart and we never gon' stop\n\n[Bridge]\n(nah!)\n(Bibby! Bibby, Bibby)\n(I- I- I love you)\n(Every man got soft spot, soft spot)\n(I love you)\n\n[Hook: Lil Bibby & Tink]\nSay, girl you fine\nI'm tryna make you mine\nI ain't tryna waste no time (time, time, time, time...)\n\nSay, boy you fine\nI ain't tryna waste no time\nI'm just tryna make you mine"}], "artist": "Lil Bibby"}
