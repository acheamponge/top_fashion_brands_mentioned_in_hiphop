(Yeah) (x4)\n\n[Hook]\nBut first I'm gonna dance cause I came here to dance\nMove cause I came here to move\nGroove, you know I'm up in a groove\nThat's what I came here to do\nFind me a girl who can dance\nLook for a girl who can move\nDance with a lady who's shakin' it, like she got somethin' to prove\n\n[Verse 2]\nBrother you know you got game\nGo ahead and get the dame\nAsk her name, say somethin'\nDon't just stand there frontin'\nWhat you want is probably what she wantin'\n[Rapped]\nRight, then I'ma say peace to my man\nAnd make my way across the floor\nI'ma cross the flow, yeah\nI'm in front of her face\nWe make eye contact\nIf she smile back, I'm grabbin' her waist\nCumbia step, we shake to the bass\nSalsa step she follow my pace\nYeah she got frace\nI tell her that my name is Nathaniel\nShe told me that she only speak in Espanol", "title": "Bailar - Scene 1", "album": "Shine Through"}], "artist": "Aloe Blacc"}
