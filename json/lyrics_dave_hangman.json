'Cause I don't really know if I'm honest\nWhen we were young we had dreams of being bosses\nBallers, doctors, lawyers in an office\nSo how did that turn into dropping out of college\nSnaps in a prison cell, bodies in a coffin\nLondon is cursed, this city's got a problem\nMy bro ain't got a bird he got an ostrich, a fucking life sentence\nSo don't talk about experience\nI say what I want and that's period\nMy team serious\nI still got a squad full of lifers\nFrom Dovegate to ISIS, freedom is priceless\nAnd I see a lot of man tryna draw me out\nI feel the tension in the air when I walk around\nBut would you rather be the person talking or the person doing all the things that people talk about?\nScratch that, I ain't with the backchat\nMy mum calls me David, girls call me Santan\nAnd fam, I don't give a fuck if you're a badman\nYou madman, the only guy I'm dodging is the tax man\nThey say that fame is a game and it's true 'cause if you say the wrong word then everybody wants to hang man\nAsk Serge about the times that I had man\nI brought the fam together like when Tommy got the black hand\nAnd if you got a good girl you need to keep her close\nAnd let her in, because the difference is\nWhen things hit the fan they're gonna disappear\nAll them sidechicks, and all them mistresses\nAll your broskis and your affiliates\nAnd all the man that you were standing in the pictures with\nThey ain't visiting 'cause they ain't got a thing to give\nI'm a hypocrite\nBut that line between stopping it and living it\nI'm sitting in the thick of it\nYou would think I told my boys to come party in South\n'Cause this year I said we need to touch Bigga Fish\nToo many yutes are dying and I'm sick of it", "year": "2018-02-28"}], "artist": "Dave"}
