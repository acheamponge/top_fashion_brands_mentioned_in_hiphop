I got story to tell this cat named Jamell\nGot the 22 shells with perells (Pirellis) on his wheels\nHe was one of youngest on the block one of the livest\nNever the type hide his burner when he hear the sirens\nHe was runnin' the city, runnin' with the grittiest, grimiest niggas\nHustlin all night up with insomnia\nWatching the fiends Glock in his jeans\nAnd he visualized the life of 2Pac in his dreams\nSwimming in papes swimming in cake buckin' at jake\nBeating a case then he fleeing the place\nYou the deal; money - power - respect\nDreams of a privat jet coke connect\nHoding techs he be set, but\nAs of know dude stuck on the cement\nWith bucket full of gin and a couple of his men\nAnd still his mom dukes had to struggle for the rent\nSo the man walked around with a bundle in his hand\nTrying to make shit right packing it up (2-5)\nWith the right amount of cut he better make shit right\nCuz it ain't no refunds in the street, just guns in the street\nAnd twelve year old niggas runnin' with heat\nAin't the devil happy\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\n2 years later Jamell now holding his daughter\nFacing alot of problems cuz his whole baby mama\nAnd his life is gettin' colder and harder\nBut he was older and smarter\nAt least he of the block now though\nBut this young gun spitter met a young dumb sister\nIt was love a first sight soon as the nigga toungekissed her\nNow he was trapped its foul but now its rap\nAnd he was dumb enough to have a seed with her\nShe ain't have no ambition in life no guidance\nNo vision in life just strippin' at night\nIn the crib she was christian and nice\nBut like to be on the block where niggas bustin like Israelites\nJamell was mistaken I don't know what he thinkin'\nWhen he found the ho she was drunk and half naked\nWith a bunch of hoodrat birds that that pass they shit\nOff to any dude like they body ain't sacred\nNow he's startin' to reminisce he can't take it\nPut the burner to his dome and his hearts racin'\nNo he's faced with a decision and gotta make it\nDoes he hate his life so much that he would take (Blaow)\n\n[Chorus]"}], "artist": "Termanology"}
