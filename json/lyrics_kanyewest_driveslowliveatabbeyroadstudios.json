The day his father passed away\nLeft him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin\u2019\nAl B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy\nHit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy\nHit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty\nBoned so much that summer, even had him a baby\nSee back-back then-then, if you had a car\nYou was the Chi-Town version of Baby\nAnd I was just a virgin, a baby\nOne of the reasons I looked up to him crazy\nI used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked\nFelt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked\nWe'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall\nThey had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all\nWith the girls, a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog\nFuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin\u2019 to get in some drawers\nSo put me on with these hoes, homie\nHe told me don\u2019t rush to get grown, drive slow, homie\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nDrive slow, homie\nDrive slow\nYou never know, homie, about these hoes, homie\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie\nWhat it do?\n\n[Scratches: A-Trak & Kanye West]\nWhat it do? What\u2013what it do?\nWhat\u2013what it do? What it\u2013what it do? Wh\u2013what it do?\nWh\u2013what it do? What it do?\nWh\u2013what it do? Wh\u2013what it do?\nWhat it\u2013what it do? Wh\u2013what it do?\nWh\u2013what it do? Wh\u2013what it do? (You never know, homie)\nWh\u2013what it do? Wh\u2013what it do?\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West & GLC]\nDrive slow, homie, homie, homie\nTurn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes\nDrive slow, homie, home, homie\nIf you're riding around the city with nowhere to go\nDrive slow, homie, homie, homie\nLive today, \u2019cause tomorrow, man, you never know\nYou never know, homie, about these hoes, homie\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie\n\n[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]\nMy car's like the movie, my car's like the crib\nI got more TVs in here than where I live\nAnd that don't make no sense, but baby, I\u2019m the shit\nAnd everything I flip, you know it's something serious (Uh-huh)\nI got the custom grill (Yeah), I got the Brabus rims\nI got the baller genetics, baby, it's evident\nYou see a player flicking, now how you ain't convinced\nThat you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit? (Just a lil bit)\nI got my custom kings, I got my Jesus chain\nMy canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings\nThey see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king\nWith that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green (Now what?)\nMy woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues\nMy cylinder's quiet, like tip-toes\nI sold O's, so this I know\nWhen you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West, GLC & Both]\nDrive slow, drive slow\nDrive slow, drive slow\nDrive slow, drive slow\nDrive slow, drive slow\nDrive slow, drive slow\nDrive slow, drive slow\nDrive slow, drive slow\nDrive slow, drive slow\nDrive slow, drive slow\nDrive slow, drive slow\nDrive slow, drive slow\nDrive slow, drive slow\nDrive slow, drive slow\nDrive slow, drive slow\n\n[Outro: Kanye West, GLC & Both]\nWhat up, y'all?\nThat's GLC in the buildin'\nIt's G.O.O.D. Music, baby\nWe love\nHold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on\nHold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on\nYou know, you know I enjoy bein' here\nAnd I love doin' songs from the new album, but\nI gotta do a joint that, if it wasn't for this one right here\nI would've never made it this far\nLet's see if y'all remember this joint right here"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
