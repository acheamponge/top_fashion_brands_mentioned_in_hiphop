No, it is not right\nFor you to say you was, then live in the spotlight\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'll strike the mag, smack the fag that said I jacked his swag\nThen smother the motherfucker with a Glad plastic bag\nI'm a maniac, like I get around violence and chain react\nDoctors still asking me,\u201dWhat the fuck you so angry at?\u201d\nI don't even know, but they say one out of every three\nBlack boys in the ghetto love metal and gun powder\nSomething about the bang, I like it a little louder\nI'm just telling the truth\u2014it ain't even something I'm proud of\nYou know you fucked, jury come back in less than an hour\nHow you deliberate a nigga fate in less than an hour?\nMoney is power, then power is nothing\nA verse from me is equal to like a hour discussion\nMalcolm X was just 2Pac without the percussion\nWho'd of thought it would amounted to nothing?\n\u2018Til I came", "album": "G.S.N.T. 3: The Troubled Times of Brian Carenard"}], "artist": "Saigon"}
