Last night was somethin' I wish I knew\nYou hate all the games that I put you through\nI ain't gonna change, Nah I ain't gonna change for you\n\nI'm a smart dude, I\u2019m tryin' get my learn on\nYou got your girls and they all fine, lets go get our burn on\nI love the way I\u2019m feelin' single, searchin' for the evening\u2019\nYou can spend the night if you don't plan on us both sleepin\u2019\n\nGet low, get loose, get down on the floor\nDrink up till' you can't think anymore\nGet low, get loose, get down on the floor\nI ain't gonna change I\u2019m not just a stupid boy\n\nI'm not lookin for my one, I\u2019m looking for my right now\nAnd baby we just way too young, too young for me to settle down\nI know what I'm doin' love. Keep that game just trust me\nI'm stupid, so please give me brain and afterwards just fuck me\n\nI do everything I want to\nI wish I would've known what you could do\nYou think that everything that is said is true\nI ain't gonna change, Nah I ain't gonna change for you\n\nGet low, get loose, get down on the floor\nDrink up till' you can't think anymore\nGet low, get loose, get down on the floor\nI ain't gonna change I\u2019m not just a stupid boy\n\nI'm tryin' cut you wanna what?\nI'm trying to cut you wanna what?\nI'm tryin' cut you wanna make love, make love\n\nI'm tryin' cut you wanna what?\nI'm trying to cut you wanna what?\nI'm tryin' cut you wanna make love, make love\n\nGet low, get loose, get down on the floor\nDrink up till' you can't think anymore\n\nGet low, get loose, get down on the floor\nGet low, get loose, get down on the floor\nGet low, get loose, get down on the floor\n\nI ain't gonna change I\u2019m not just a stupid boy\n(Stupid boy)"}], "artist": "T.
