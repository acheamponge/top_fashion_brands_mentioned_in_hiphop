Did his thang from slanging\nPlus a nigga kept his steel and his range was stainless\nMove rocks from 9-1 til 2002\nVegas Nights going crazy even found him a boo\nHit the club 50 deep, was surrounded with troops\nNever lacked ( ... ) (....) to you, Everything was well plotted\nPlanned it all in advance, got fronted his first brick\nStarted off with a chance, put his homeboy on, watch who you calling ya mans. Cause niggas snakes tell the jakes(?) til it fall out of his hands\n\nWatch the jealous niggas too\nYeah the ones with greed\nThe ones who watched you starve\nThe ones you feed\nThe ones you always give but always need\nYou gotta.. cut them off and watch them bleed\nAnd these are all wise words, these are laws of power\nNever listen to the words from the jaws of cowards\nCuz these niggas tell lies that are as tall as towers\nWhere the weak dont eat and the small devoured\n\nYou see Raymond learned these things in the earliest stage\nFrom ATL to New York, Niggas heard of his rage\nHe growing mad with dollars, gucci collar, fendi , prada\nNigga fall in love with designer\nBlowing cash real fast, never building a savings\nStart to hit a couple licks, even steal from the Haitians\nComing back on top, making bills and them payments\nBut its only temporary, brother killed on the pavement\nNow his eyes is open, growing wiser, start to stack his bread, a soul survivor\nBut his karma coming bold and proper\nHeres the key to the safe what he told Elijah\nRemember what i said before, watch who you calling your brother\nThe same niggas that you trusted make you fall in the gutter\nElijah had his own plan, he wasn't a grown man, traded stocks with the enemy, robbed his own (...)?\n\nCalled Raymond, crying and pleading, couldn't believe him\nStole from his own homie, damn.. Really deceived him\nBut nah Raymond not mad, that nigga calm and collective\nKicked Elijah out the gang, took his charm and his necklace\nSee he thought Raymond was lacking, but was given a test\nBut he failed.. two shots and got hit in his vest\nWe dont tolerate the rats, we get'n rid of the pest\nHad to sacrifice, the brooks life, legitimate chest\nThats how you gotta approach it, we never hide and we focus\nBut we posted on the block like Thompson & Bogut\nSee he tryna get out the game and have a early retirement\nWasted talent but he's just a product of his environment\nNot to mention the tension, visits (?) is getting so tiring\nKnowing he could be next, his brother's death is inspiring (?)\nTime expiring, quickly gotta think of a plan\nCause feds tapping , kidnapping getting linked to his camp\nNiggas banging on the door, notice the blink and the lamps\nThey was plotting and scheming, yeah the robbers and demons\nAnd everyday is someone thats on his property gleamin\nBut you know his AK is always properly beamin\n\nTired of living this shit and straight sick of this life\nPlus he a grown man now, he got a kid and a wife\nAnd had a lil rough start but now he getting it right\nSigns from god overbearing, peep the flickering lights\nSo he saved a lump some, still collecting his royalty\nKnow the game is so fake and niggas they lack loyalty\nIn chains called the cop? more important his lawyer fees\nThe livestyle he living it is getting so spoiling\nSo he had to man up, start making his boss move\nInvest in yourself cause dawg thats all you\nHe used to play with steel and using the raw tools\nBut he left the crack game and went in to law school", "title": "Story"}]}
