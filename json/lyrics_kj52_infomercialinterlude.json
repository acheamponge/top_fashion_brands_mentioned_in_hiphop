Thats right! Its Funky! Well dont take our word for it! Listen to our sponser the Kleesder!\n\n{Todd Collins in weird voice}\nThat's right it slices it dices it makes these .....[?] Ha Ha ha Ha!\n\n(KJ-52) But don't take our word for it, ask these satisfied customers!\n\nI used to be a cross eyed bowlegged one-armed safety patrolman but since listening to KJ-52 I've since elevated myself to crossing guard. Thank You KJ!\n\n(KJ-52) Hey no problem that's what we're here for. Well come on down to KJ-52. If you act now well throw in a mulletnator! That's right, it'll give yourself a mullet haircut before you even know what happened!\nSo Come on down. Act now while supplies are limited\n\nKJ-52 and TC are not responsible for animal attacks based on the mull haircut thank you"}]}
