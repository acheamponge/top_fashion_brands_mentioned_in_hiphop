'Cause I been buzzin'\nAnd they be fuckin' on my squad, tryna get to the duffle\n\n[Chorus: Pouya]\nI don't wanna pull the stick out and bug out\nNow she wanna pull my dick out and fuck now\nFlick my wrist like I'm a bitch now, that bust down\nPull up in that '96 Crown with the windows down\nI don't wanna pull the stick out and bug out\nNow she wanna pull my dick out and fuck now\nFlick my wrist like I'm a bitch now, that bust down\nPull up in that '96 Crown with the windows down", "year": "2018-05-28"}]}
