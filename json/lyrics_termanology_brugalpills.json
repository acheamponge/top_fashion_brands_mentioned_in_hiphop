Keep it on safety or abuse?\nMy enemies, fake thug celebrities\nAnd back stabbing birdies out for my cheese\nBest prepare cause if it's Tech just fled\nYou gon look like you just met the electric chair\nJump up, hopping out my Lexus chair\nEat your food, finish up my breakfast\nI got money in my pocket but it don't mean shit\n'Cause money can't save you from a bullet splittin yo wig\nYour money can't save you from a stray or catching aids\nOr catching a blade deep in yo heart, stopping yo day\nRed light, green light, ambulances is dancing through traffic\nTryna save yo ass, I'm Satan takin you ransom\nAnd you were handsome, at least that's what yo mama said\nNow you in deep shit like Osama had\nGet you fun close range, leave the lama red\nI'm a scummer head, piff blowin ganja head\nI wouldn't trust that bitch so she a bubble head\nProbably go to the church and give the father head\n\n[Hook: x2]\nBrugal Pills, I said Brugal Pills\nTake a couple pills, crush em up in the ale\nSip a little liquor, take a couple more pills\nNow tell me how you feel, tell me how you feel\n\n[Outro:]\nYea, shout out all my Dominicans, all my Puerto Ricans\nEverybody on that Brugal\nWe getting drunk in here ya'll\nST dot, come on"}], "artist": "Termanology"}
