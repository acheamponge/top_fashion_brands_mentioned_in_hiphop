It's gonna be incredible, I'm so happy for you.\"\nEveryone else was like \"Pssssshhh *clicks tongue* maaaaan get ready.\"\nAnd it was so discouraging to me!\nNow luckily, for me, I-I'm still waiting for that disaster that their talking about because it's been incredible for me\nWe've had our ups and downs, obviously, because its a relationship\nBut it has not been the disastrous thing that everybody said it was gonna be\nDel: Its been the opposite\nIts been the opposite!\nIt's been such a pleasure\nBut, when I would ask people \"What do you really look for in a wife?\"\nI was saying those things I was like \"I definitely wanna be on the same page about things that are most important to me.\"\nAnother thing which I think is like a simpler way of saying it is: \"What crap are you willing to deal with?\""}]}
