Layza]\n\n(Intro)(Layza)\n\nOne step two step killing sum breh (breh)\nI'm known to kill mans then move somewhere\nMan looks at me and he's in for a scare (scare)\nBust out the chorus and pass me the chair\n\n(Chorus)(Kano)\nIf you think I'm hot... Show me your tits\nI will pick a gyal then take her to the ritz\nWe fuck all night then make sum kids\nThen back to the studio to make sum hits\n[x2]\n\n(Layza)\nSo look, how come I'm in top notch\nAnd you're out on the streets trying to kotch\nI don't mean to offend thee but it's just my turn\nLet me spit my lyrics and watch you burn\nYeh Mr ka to tha no... And layza...\nSounds of the Carpenders Park or perhaps the Watford?\nNahhhh\n\n(Kano)\nWatch out for the album on it's way", "title": "Freestyle", "album": null}], "artist": "Akon"}
