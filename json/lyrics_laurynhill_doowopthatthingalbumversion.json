(x3)\nCome again (x3)\n\n[Bridge (x3)]\nWatch out, watch out\nLook out, look out\n\n\n[Hooks]\nGirls you know you\u2019d better watch out\nSome guys, some guys are only about\nThat thing, that thing, that thing\nThat thing, that thing, that thing\n\nGuys you know you\u2019d better watch out\nSome girls, some girls are only about\nThat thing, that thing, that thing\nThat thing, that thing, that thing\n\nGirls you know you\u2019d better watch out\nSome guys, some guys are only about\nThat thing, that thing, that thing\nThat thing, that thing, that thing"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
