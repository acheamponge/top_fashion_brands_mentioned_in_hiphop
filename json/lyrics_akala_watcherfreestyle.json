You stupid\nOn the low-low is how you should do tings\nPassing your straps for stripe, you niggas are bitches\nI don't know you, I know who you clippin', so much are snitches\nFuck the fame and the name, that ain't the aim of the game\nSupposed to scheme for a better day\nBut niggas can't see, it's like they blind\nIt's cool, 25, plenty time to open your eyes\nLike Memphis, future bleak, government vengeance\nLike hell they wanna help, they just uppin' the sentence\nTwo strikes is life in the country we live in\nIf you pop shots, but not if you fuck children\nSo who you think they tryin' to imprison?\nBut niggas don't wanna listen\nLimited vision is inhibited wisdom\nSo I keep my eyes open, every moment I'm focused\nYou jokers is bogus, I flow ferocious I'm sure that you know this\nA lot of dudes spittin' written but I'm ripping riddims\nGod given, so you sinnin' if you think that you winnin'\nNo religion, not a Christian I believe in the spirit\nEven if you a heathen, you believe in my lyrics\nI'm the Einstein of physics, Shakespeare to writing\nTyson to fighting, strikin' like lightnin', we're frightenin', timin' like (?)\nSee clear, my vision refined\nLook through my eyes, you feel like you see them for the first time\nI spot the snakes, I know they kind\nThe fakes is easy to break\nThey got no spine, them man are principle\nDiscipline you niggas like the principal\nMy lyrical miracles, biblical to spiritual criminals", "year": null, "album": "The War Mixtape", "image": "https://images.genius.com/85a1a9e929a1b07df16e80960429050f.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
