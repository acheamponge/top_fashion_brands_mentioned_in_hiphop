He ain't ever made it rain\nYour man is a fraud, your boyfriend's livin' a lie\nYou're kinda like Rachel Zane\nI'm gentle when it comes to the girl dem\nBut I'm gangster with some voddy and voss\nMy girl don't wanna stop for a chat\nThen I'm onto her friends like Joey and Ross\nBabe, what you mean you can't talk for a sec?\nIt's calm, you don't even know what you lost\nStone Island from my head to my feet\nWhen I step on the street, I dunno what it cost, but\nI know it's expensive\nShe told me she love me but really I don't even know if she meant it\nAnd if feds pull this whip, that's numerous offences\nWhy you gassed off a rack?\nI put three on my dentist, I put three on my dentist\n\n[Bridge: J Hus]\nClose your eyes, it might be blinding\nAnd they wonder why I'm smiling\nUntil I hear a siren, we pulled off in perfect timing\nClose your eyes, it might be blinding\nAnd they wonder why I'm smiling\nUntil I hear a siren, we pulled off in perfect timing\n\n[Chorus: Dave]\nI changed my number couple times cah' man kept callin' me for things\nAnd man are hatin' but they wavin' when they saw me on their strip, I know\nI know they see me on the camera\nMight just link Samantha\nMix the gentleman with gangster\nI changed my number couple times cah' man kept callin' me for things\nAnd man are hatin' but they wavin' when they saw me on their strip, I know\nI know they see me on the camera\nMight just link Samantha\nMix the gentleman with gangster", "year": "2017-01-26"}], "artist": "Dave"}
