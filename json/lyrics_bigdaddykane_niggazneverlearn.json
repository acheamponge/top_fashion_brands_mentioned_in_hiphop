Then put that mic on mute\nBecause you'll be in more danger than Penelope Pitstop\nPoint blank, you get your shit dropped\nI got a death blow whenever I throw\nWith double impact to take out the whole row\nHuh, I start swingin' again and again\nYou'll hear so many \u201cOoh-ah's\u201d you'll think it was Boyz II Men\nI break down, shakedown, proceed down, beat down\nBack down, smackdown, rip down, get down\nShowdown, throwdown, rundown, come down!
