Do you have a little dog - a little chow or something? *laughs*\n\nD: No, Jonathan!\n\nC: Is that a raincoat?\n\nD: Yes, it is! Now, Kanye's decided to release this, Yeezus, his most exciting record so far. It should be obvious by now that \"New Slaves\" is the undisputed masterpiece of Yeezus. A song so catchy, most people won't even remember the lyrics! But they should. And then there's the song \"I Am a God\". The title practically speaks for itself, but of course the insecurities of the mainstream music press will never understand its true meaning because it's about me! Hey Jonathan!\n\nD: Try getting the Yeezus album now motherfucker!"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
