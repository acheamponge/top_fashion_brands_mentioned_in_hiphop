Nigga it was our turn\nNow a nigga gotta catch the fade like some side burns\nThe love of money will get niggas on your side burnt\nThat\u2019s why its wise to sever ties before the tides turn\nApply my ethics, my efforts unmatched\nI open doors from my city and left 'em unlatched\nRun that, they rob niggas bare face until they face a bear and feel bare look in their face, Uhh\nThe rare tapes of the incredible\nThese miracles you can't pencil in on a schedule\nConceptual, exceptional, exception to the rule yes the truly intellectual\nCool introspective of a dude in a confessional\nMove, peep the moves of the grooviest professional\nI\u2019m blessing you\nSeek freedom break free from whatever stressing you\nTry to gather the rest without letting em have the best in you\nI wish the best for you but it\u2019s probably the worst for you\nShit might not even work for you\nIs it worth it to\nBe giving my gift if its like a curse to you\nTry to write this in cursive too without picking a pen up\nThen sign it sincerely yours\nThe man that has many flaws but master picking his chin up, King"}]}
