Fuck that\nMan's at the door next day like Amazon Prime; free delivery\nI'll murder the beat till you're sick of me\nStraight bars, no need for the trickery\nMan will smoke that beef like Hickory\nYo, AJ, pass the auxillary\nAnd the iPhone adapter\nGive man chills like the fear factor\nAJ, DC\nWorldwide music, it's a new chapter\n\n[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]\nHave the game in a headlock\nIf I see the cop that killed my brother\nBelieve he'll die from the headshots\nBeam on the Glock in my Hancock\nHedgehog when I get away\nWhen I'm looking for a prey, better pray like a nun\nWith a cup full of rum, when the rum is red\nTote a gun instead, dollar bill in ten\nWhen you meet death, reapers are grim\nFucking with me? Send the Reaper to him\nPull out the stick on a pussy ass nigga\nThey tell me I look like a people to him\nUnder my brim, abandon the so black\nProbably black as my gat, facts\nSwitch up the style and relax, tax\nAct like a hoe, get the MAC wax\nLike tack tack\nHit 'em in the back, now that's that\nGat to the face, that's Snapchat\nNow you a bitch like Kat Stacks, damn\nI don't talk no shit\n'Cause I got too much honour\nNine-millimetre go bang\nAnd this piercing armour", "year": "2017-10-06", "album": "Secure the Bag!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bb3ef87fb8c9b11455dd7d9d9c74fbf9.499x499x1.jpg"}], "artist": "AJ Tracey"}
