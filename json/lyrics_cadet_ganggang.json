We got bangers\nInterrogate man, make man have manners\nPut you in a cell for twenty-four hours\nLike, what you gonna say, brudda?\nWaste man's time 'cause I want to\nLike fuck that, what you gonna say brudda?\nPussy-hole, do your research, the system's in my favour\nFuck you up right now\nAnd I'm calm it won't make the news or the paper\nYeah, I got it patterned like that\nNo I shouldn't but, yeah, man, I'm bragging like that\nI'll say, \"You put your hands on me\"\nI know you never, but I'll say it happened like that\nNothing, no, you can't tell me nothing\nBust case all the time like it's nothing\nYou know how much shit we did?\nIt was my team that got down Mark Duggan\n\n[Verse 2]\nNext day on the force, we back, again\nGet searched, 'cause you're black again\nChoke out Rashan Charles in East London, say it's an accident\nAnd I'm this close to banning drill, and done that shit\nSomeone got stabbed at the Rated Awards\nMm, yeah, we love that shit\nYeah I know about grime, Link Up and all dat\nWhere you're so stupid; stab someone, go booth and record that\nAnd then say you're on obbo\nNo, you're just so easy to follow\nAnd I got a quota that I gotta reach\nGet two more of you lot by tomorrow\nAnd let me tell you suttin' to tell your brothers\nIt don't matter that you got a bally on now\nThere's videos before when your face ain't covered, you stupid pricks\nYou make me sick\nLike, \"Officer, I'm recording you\"\nSo? You think I give a shit?\nWitnesses say they'll complain because they see me taking the piss\nOne: they never do\nAnd two: if they do, I get a slap on the wrist\nSo, pussy-hole, let me tell you suttin'\nI can violate you for fucking nothing\nAnd get away with it, 'cause we're the judges\nStop saying, \"Gang\", we're the only gang in London, pussy\n\n[Outro]\nL.A.
