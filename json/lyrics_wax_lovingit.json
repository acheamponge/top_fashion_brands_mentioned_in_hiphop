A watched kettle, it never boils\nI'll reap the benefits and I'll get away with the spoils of chillin'\n'Cause chillin' is a feeling more thrillin'\nLord willing, I could float from the floor to the ceilin'\nI'm a old schooler, flow ruler\nTo get this hot, you should probably cop bottles of Chalula\nCompared to snow, cooler, I'm a go-getter\nThe flow meta, you should probably know better\nThan to ever try to test\nMe or my brother's crew\nThere could be no other two that could do it like we do\nThat's a guaranteed, certified, bulletproof covenant\nWe lovin' it, yes, yes, we lovin' it\n\n[Chorus: Wax]\nI'm lovin' it, lovin' it, lovin' it (Word?)\nLovin' it, lovin' it, lovin' it (Okay)\nI'm lovin' it, lovin' it, lovin' it (Uh-huh, uh-huh)\nLovin' it, lovin' it, lovin' it (Okay)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e015818e43a752157eb3e43900823a29.999x999x1.jpg", "album": "B.A.A.A", "title": "Loving It"}]}
