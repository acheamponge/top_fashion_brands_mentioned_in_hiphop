Somebody tell me why\nI\u2019m in love with a lie\nI\u2019m too proud to beg, and too angry to cry\nGot me wondering why? Somebody tell me why\nI\u2019m in love with a lie\n\n[Verse Two: Fashawn]\nSomedays I wake up and I don\u2019t wanna write it\nGo to the lab, everyone\u2019s invited\nYeah, I swear nothing\u2019s exciting\nToday\u2019s never sunny it\u2019s just thunder and lightning\nFighting like I\u2019m rumbling with Tyson\nFor the love of the public got me stuck in this climate\nYeah, wondering why I\u2019m even fucking with rhyming\nSince a younging all the struggle with timing\nAll I need some good weed, some red wine\nYeah, instead of all of these dead lines\nAnticipation, fans sitting, waiting\nKnowing nothing of your man\u2019s situation\nI travel light but the load\u2019s heavy enough\nDone enough, already give up\nWhat I say to myself, but this is what I do\nAt the end of the day, I do it for you, you\n\n[Bridge: Fashawn]\nGot you nigga, news\nGot me sitting confused\nHit the spliff and take a sip with the brew\nNothing coming from my lips but the truth\n\n[Hook: Fashawn]\nI\u2019m too proud to beg, too angry to cry\nGot me wondering why? Somebody tell me why\nI\u2019m in love with a lie\nI\u2019m too proud to beg, and too angry to cry\nGot me wondering why? Somebody tell me why\nI\u2019m in love with a lie", "title": "In Love With A Lie"}]}
