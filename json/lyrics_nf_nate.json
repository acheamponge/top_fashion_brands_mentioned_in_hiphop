(Yeah)\nAnd when we feel like someone's leaving, we start panickin'? (Yeah)\nAnd yo, I wish I could say I've learned to manage it\nYou think it's bad now, but you don't know the half of it\nPassion is somethin' we have never lacked\nWe see it the most when we're writin' raps\nThey think it's funny now, let 'em laugh\nI know you think it's just an outlet when you're really mad\nBut you don't know the platform you're about to have (Oh)\nI know some things about the future you ain't ready for\nI know some things that you gon' cover up, but can't ignore\nAnd what hurts is they gon' surface at the worst moments\nAnd we gon' act like it don't hurt us, but it hurts, don't it?\nWe walk around with the devil talkin' on both shoulders\nWish I could tell you that he disappears when we get older\nBut that's just not the case, and I know you feel out of place\nAnd everything is not okay, and life can be a lot to take, but\u2026\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't know if you can hear me or not\nBut if you can, I just want you to know\nYou gon' make a lotta mistakes\nAnd they gon' laugh in our face\nThat's part of life, that's just the way that it goes\n(That's just the way that it goes)\nAnd I don't know if you can hear me or not\nBut if you can, I just need you to get it\nI know you been questionin' life\nTrust me, I know what it's like\nI'm here for you if you need someone to listen\nDo you need someone to listen?\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou know how intoxicated people make us nervous?\nTo the point sometimes we shake and it feels so disturbin'\nDon't be scared, that's just trauma tryna reach the surface\nAnd tell us everyone we love is gonna try to hurt us\nWhich isn't true, but it's a lie that both of us believe in\nYeah, you might get a glimpse of happiness from your achievements\nBut what you'll learn as you get older, every time you reach one\nIs you'll just make another goal that doesn't lead to freedom\nSee, some things about to happen that you can't imagine\nAt 24, you'll drop an album, and you'll call it Mansion\nAt 25, you'll put out Therapy and gain some traction\nSkip to track number four, now that's a really sad one\nYeah, Perception's coming next, we 'bout to reach the masses\nIt sounds awesome; at the same time, it doesn't matter\nAt 27, we'll make millions, but it's really sad 'cause\nYou learn to realize that none of this will make you happy\n\n[Outro]\nI wish that I could look at you with empathy\nSometimes I feel like I've become what you were scared to be\nWhich makes it really hard to look at you with sympathy\n'Cause if I'm feeling bad for you, then I have to feel bad for me\nAnd that's just something I feel like we don't deserve\nThat's why I'm always looking down on you, I know it hurts\nI'm sure you have a lot of questions\nI've been tryna search to find us both some answers\nI'll be here for you if things get worse\nToo many faces, too many faces, too many faces"}], "artist": "NF"}
