Kyo no special wa Kujira dazo!\nYum\nSo daro Hoshii daro Kono kasu yaro\nOh that whale though\nYo\n\nNow what's better than the feeling of gutting the wild beast\nBeneath the earth sheets with the taste of mild beef\nCuisine with the rice and soy Oh boy\nWant to come up to the ocean run the deep with the boys\nNow whales, dolphins, narwhals, krills\nThe Japs got a special set of skills that involves killing\nWe ain't chilling till we distribute the mercury\nGot MSG and it's eating till it's hurting me yum\nNow that's food to die for\nThat's food to kill for\nThat's food to divide laws\nI ain't saying shit You caught it for science\nTook a couple organs Give the rest to the markets\nHa! Now that's harmless\nExcept for the whale Its got a harness\nIf the skins a little thicker than the rest of them\nYou can bet that America's gonna bless them\nTry to caress them So they can be the best men\nClearly The way of our quotation specimens\nDespite spilling the oil like it was estrogen\nDespite killing the millions of middle eastern men\nDespite the decency to save another human being\nWaste time save creatures from the sea", "year": "2014-05-23"}]}
