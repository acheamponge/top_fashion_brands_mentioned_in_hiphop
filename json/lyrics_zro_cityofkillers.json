I can fold, with a pair of nuts this damn swoll\n'Cause where a nigga was raised, don't nobody play games\nIt's like your life is a sweet, and reality's the flame\nSo why the fuck you trying to torture, with that dip in the middle\nIt's like I'm swallowing mighty bites, while you be nibbling on skittles\nCause this city we in, it ain't no such thing as friends\nAnd once it comes down to paper, you down to bump off your kin\nYou think I'm lying, what thoughts be in my head as I walk around\nSo now you know when you see me, why my face is quick to chalk a frown\n'Cause I don't trust nobody, nope not a god damn soul\nSo now you know I'm a hog, from high to a deep level of cold\nThinking why niggas let me broke, in this city of Houston\nBut ain't no stopping Bam, I'ma keep my ego to boosting\n'Cause I got a bunch of fans that love me, and bitches that jock\nI got killas in my click, and I keep thugs on my block\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI'm just letting you know don't test me, I'm with my chrome\nI'm still in my ghetto peel, I'm more than your average nigga\nFrom that Maab, lookin out the house with a bed with a bullet in the way\nThat click your spine and now you crying, cause you realize\nThat your dick, can't even get hard\n\n[Verse 2: Trae]\nWho the hell could it be, peeping on me\nT to the R to the motherfucking A-E\nKillas that's like mad trucks with a bust, better duck\nWho the fuck running up so nigga what, 'fore I leave my star full of that heat\nGotta watch my back, 'fore I be alone\nThat shit is gon' fall, and the while back me up\nTo the sides shapey grin, gotta know get enough for them\nThat T to the E to the E to the A\nIt's going down South Klique, what you wanna do\nBitch throwing up my set, infrareds to your chest with a mess\nNow stop you drop, like sweat it out my face\nWhat killas want right behind me, (I think you lying) so try me\nThese hater-fied niggas don't play\nCut in all my killas, till the day I'm dead and deceased\nIt'll be, us niggas out Houston won't ever fade\nWhat I'm all about, hoping with open kicking eyes open, peeping\nI gotta be scoping better keep wishing, G's on these streets be low\nTill the point of my life I can't go, got hatred not cause a hoe\nK-I double L-A-K-L-A-N to the B to the A to the M, gotta represent\nNever know with a lifestyle, with a five dolla with a mile\nGotta get my life be twisting thoughts, a thought in the vault\nYou can't forget and you feel the anger, with one in the chamber\nGrill in the back, but its your, me and T.A.Z. on the regular\nMy K, fives don't give a damn to hustle so\nCan't change on my feet to the dip, dropping tops\n'Til the playa get a hit, to the drink to the brain get me crunk\nGet a boost can't tougher shit, city of killas and it get loose\n\n[Chorus 2]\nFuck around and pull out my AK, and bust yo ass in the head\nI'm trying to leave you dead, with an infrared\nI never be giving a fuck aboooout, you\nIt got me going me crazy, got a nigga going crazy\nGot me going crazy, crazy\n\n[Verse 3: T.A.Z.]\nT.A.Z. the all mighty devil, specialize in the methods of torture\nSo stepping without a weapon's not a good idea, just thought I'd warn you\nI'm not your average nigga I'm a Guerilla, just look at the frown on face\nRunning with the pack, ready to attack\nFucked up, and get your whole crew erased\nIf you think I'm playing, come test me\nBetter catch me slipping, to get the best of me\nDeadly, when me toss this K to you\nFocused and keep my aim steady, cause its serious\nAnd I run with killas, dealas and guerillas coming to get you\nBetter make a move fast, when I blast\nWith no feelings, with a firm grip on my trigga\nOpen fire with no hesitation, infiltrating start eliminating\nYour troops execution style, leaving em face down on the pavement\nA career with them here, look em up and let's see who's the boss\nWatching it get raw, coming home with three hitter quitters\nThat'll beat you up from the back gone, making niggas mind\nRepresenting Guerilla Maab to the fullest, let me pull it\nTo the made a mistake, and try to give me a break\nAnd then use it when you pull it, in the city of killas\nOnly the tough and the strong and those who have hearts survive\nGuerilla Maab's on the rise, nigga\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI'm just letting you know don't test me, I'm with my chrome\nI'm still in my ghetto peel, I'm more than your average nigga\nFrom that Maab, lookin out the house with a bed with a bullet in the way\nThat click your spine and now you crying, cause you realize\nThat your dick, can't even get hard\nI'm just letting you know don't test me, I'm with my chrome\nI'm still in my ghetto peel, I'm more than your average nigga\nFrom that Maab, lookin out the house with a bed with a bullet in the way\nThat click your spine and now you crying, cause you realize\nThat your dick, can't even get hard\n\n[Verse 4: Z-Ro]\nGot my Glock 44, and I think to myself\nA murdering, I'm gon grow\nBut I got the fever, for the favor of a big pocket\nAnd a blue white, come with the look so sneaky\nI major in at 175 pounds, ?then I'm gone in a few minutes?\nAround when I come around, in red Chucks\nBut a nigga can't even see me or hear me, fear me\nWhen I'm in a zone of depression, gotta get a crib\nGotta get a Lac, but I can't get a job\nBut I really gotta get a weapon, then I be stepping\nReally be stepping, and a motherfucker temper\nStart motivation draining, really bumping the fat\nAnd your shit'll get up out your purse\nEverything I see, I'm claiming as mine\nWith a motherfucking nine, you don't give and dump\nNigga we got good skills, and running endo in\nYou don't wanna meet that E, really beat your feet\nCause I don't hesitate, to pull a tre-8 to the chest plate\nThen I want a rake to scrape the plate, with a mouth full of diamonds\nAnd the fifth wheel, be steady reclining\nCause I got ends on a All Star Lex at first\n84's and boulder blocks, elbows shining\nCharging don't give it up, what it takes don't never retire\nGotta get the Glock, cause I gotta be making my money\nBy robbing and stealing, drug dealing try to make a million\nAnd plus thinking bout feddy, and running my city\nIn the city of killers\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI'm just letting you know don't test me, I'm with my chrome\nI'm still in my ghetto peel, I'm more than your average nigga\nFrom that Maab, lookin out the house with a bed with a bullet in the way\nThat click your spine and now you crying, cause you realize\nThat your dick, can't even get hard\nI'm just letting you know don't test me, I'm with my chrome\nI'm still in my ghetto peel, I'm more than your average nigga\nFrom that Maab, lookin out the house with a bed with a bullet in the way\nThat click your spine and now you crying, cause you realize\nThat your dick, can't even get hard\n\n[Chorus 2]\nFuck around and pull out my AK, and bust yo ass in the head\nI'm trying to leave you dead, with an infrared\nI never be giving a fuck aboooout, you\nIt got me going me crazy, got a nigga going crazy\nGot me going crazy, crazy", "year": "1998-06-16", "image": "https://images.genius.com/50eb430b755a13059c2a4c05d5d2b239.500x496x1.jpg"}]}
