But do people in general have an imbalance of chemicals?\nMaybe indecisiveness\nTell me, are we loving or we fucking? Cause I couldn't ask the pastor or the scientist\nThey like vitamins, ions, the anions, but\nMaybe if my heart stopped beating, it wouldn't hurt this much\nHuh", "year": "2009-02-23", "album": "Volume: Two!
