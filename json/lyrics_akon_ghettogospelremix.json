Ma Ghetto Gospel!\n\nGhetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin'\n\n(2Pac)\nIf I could recollect before my hood days\nI'd sit and reminisce, nigga and bliss on the good days\nI stop and stare at the younger, my heart goes to 'em\nThey tested, it was stressed that they under\nWe never really went threw that coz we was born B.C u n me b4 crack\nIn our days, things changed\nEveryone's ashamed to the youth 'cause the truth looks strange\nAnd for me it's reversed, we left them a world that's cursed, and it hurts\nCause any day they'll push the button\nAnd y'all condemned like Malcolm x and Bobby Hunton, died for nothin\nDon't them let me get teary, the world looks dreary\nBut when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly\nThere's no need for you to fear me\nIf you take the time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me\nIt ain't about black or white, 'cause we're human\nI hope we see the light before its ruined\nMy ghetto gospel\n\n(Akon)\nWhoever said that this struggle would stop today\nA lot of niggas dead or locked away\nTeenage Women growing up with aids\nCause that's the life when your\nLiving in the (ghetto)\nOr eating in the (ghetto)\nOr sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto)\nThat's the life when your\nLiving in the (ghetto)\nOr eating in the (ghetto)\nOr sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)\n\n(2Pac)\nTell me do you see that old lady ain't it sad\nLiving out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has\nAnd over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy\nGuess she's given birth to a baby\nI don't trip and let it fade me, from outta the frying pan\nWe jump into another form of slavery\nEven now I keep discouraged\nWonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage\nI refuse to be a role model\nI set goals, take control, drink out my own bottle\nI make mistakes, I learn from everyone\nAnd when its said and done\nI bet this brotha be a better one\nIf I'm upset, you don't stress\nNever forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet\nI feel his hand on my brain\nWhen I write rhymes, I go blind, and let the lord do his thang\nBut am I less holy\n'cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies\nBefore we find world peace\nWe gotta find peace in that war on the streets\nMy ghetto gospel\n\n(Akon)\nWhoever said that this struggle would stop today\nA lot of niggas dead or locked away\nTeenage Women growing up with aids\nCause that's the life when your\nLiving in the (ghetto)\nOr eating in the (ghetto)\nOr sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto)\nThat's the life when your\nLiving in the (ghetto)\nOr eating in the (ghetto)\nOr sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)\n\n(Akon)\nGun shots every night in the (ghetto)\nCrooked cops on sight in the (ghetto)\nEvery day is a fight in the (ghetto)\n(oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto)\nGot kids to feed in the (ghetto)\nSelling coke and weed in the (ghetto)\nEvery day somebody bleeding in the (ghetto)\n(oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto)\n\n'cause that's the life when your\nLivin in the (ghetto)\nOr livin by the (ghetto)\nOr eatin in the (ghetto, ghetto)\n'cause that's the life your\nLivin in the (ghetto)\nOr sleepin in the (ghetto)\nLivin in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)", "title": "Ghetto Gospel (Remix)", "album": null}], "artist": "Akon"}
