Get you fifteen knots, quick\nThat's a lump sum, sweaty bitches Trump dumb\nFifteen shots to that head, I get 'em punch drunk\nFifteen milli' stalking that IG\nSo why in the fuck would I need a ID?\nHoes looking thirsty, get on my IV\nVoice of the new generation, you can't deny me\nTape dropping September, I hope you hoes ready\nFifteen, Black Mamba, shit gon' be so deadly\n(Tape dropping September, I hope you hoes ready\nBust fifteen tons, this shit is so heavy)\n\n[Chorus]\nFifteen, fifteen, rose up from the depths, now I live a dream\nFifteen, fifteen, making history, this shit something they never seen", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8cab2bb2a29274849575b80fc30ad4e0.562x562x1.jpg", "year": "2018-08-14", "title": "15 (Intro)", "album": "15"}]}
