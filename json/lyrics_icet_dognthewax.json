The surgeon general of Chilltown, New York has determined that the sounds you're about to hear, can be devastating to your ear\"\n\n[Verse 3: Ice-T]\nSharp as a razor, down as dirt\nRhyme is my life, party is my work\nL.A. is my place, More Righteous is my base\nSo my lyrics make sense, no words I waste\nDown for a duel, colder than Kool\nChill with the brothers who built the old school\nRhyme like a rocket, smooths in the pocket\nProgram the 808 and just lock it\nCrash the studio with my crew, twenty four tracks mixed down to two\nJam hits the stores, packed kinds of floors\nFreaks in my hotel room by the scores\nThis MC Ice-T, I rock the freaks to ecstasy\nTake them to the T-O-P and bust them out officially\nNever off, always on, rockin' to the break of dawn\nLike this, like that, an MC that's not the whack\nAll rappers in the game, recognize my name\nThey write off as been lame, or get me credit for my fame\nI'm here to make it clear, '86 is my year\nI'm the rapper you should fear and I'll have to peer\nSupreme MC Chief, and when I die in my belief\nBattle from L.A. to Rome, rock beyond the Thunderdome\nSound hard, know why? It is, don't try\nOnly the top MCs will master this ability\nIf you do, you'll find out what that misword [?]\nOr run that other [?], for high speed poetry\nTake advice from Ice-T, leave the cuts to Evil E\nGet a girl, feel the bass, rock her at this funky pace, ah!\n\n[Break: DJ Flash displaying Old School turntablizm skills]\n\n[Verse 4: Ice-T]\nI'm dialing M, for murdering fine MC's heads\nShowing no remorse, reanimatin' the dead\nKicking dirt in the wombs, turning a wheel in the rap\nI'll make you run for the hills with a streak up your back\nMy rhymes are my pigeons, stock cooler than cold\nBoys always convincing, jewelry solid gold\nMagnified finesse, a Hollywood address\nThe perpetrator, cremator, representing the West\nAvenge is my best friend, homicide is my life\nI write my rhymes in my book with blood on the knife\nNever been beaten in life, never planned to beat\nEither rocked two days straight before I take a breath\nThe rhymes, memorize them like inside my head\nAnd anyone who dared bite somehow ends up dead\nGot a license to kill, dogs refusing to chill\nUncut violence is my true thrill\nI'm a hitman kinda sort of, suckers talk in manure\nWith co-cold man known tactics, no man can endure\nNot to be mistaken, when MCs fakin'\nAll contracts issued, to Ice-T are taken, with the multitude routes\nYou have no chance to shout\nWith the silencer of a ninja, your lights are out\nGirls cry to sight, some in Latin fight\nFor the post positions at my jam each night\nThe player from L.A., cooler than any Jay!\nMy name is Ice-T, I make the mafia pay!\nDoggin' the wax!\n\n[Outro: DJ Flash]\nNot bad y'all!\nNot bad at all!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/df4557e49373e2fa2965c8b6d8afb990.600x592x1.jpg", "album": "The Classic Collection", "year": null}]}
