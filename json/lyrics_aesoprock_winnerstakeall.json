Brain buff, hostile youth\nChop it up, lock a noose upon it\nYou will die for the glory of...Shit, I can't put my finger on it\nBut it's big! Big and legitimate\nJustify women and kiddie killer shit, iller it builds\nSo he is not a natural predator, but can dismantle an AK-47\nClean and rebuild before you can mayday bretheren (Mayday!)\nMuddy-gut snake eyes, he approaches cobras with an ugly muck\nAnd bloody Bowie knife clamped in the canines\nWake 'em with that blind military mechanism set to bludgeon\nWHAT IS YOUR MAJOR MALFUNCTION!?\n\n[Hook]\nI have landed safely\nI have not recieved my papers\nI have zero natural enemies\nI don't know my location\nI have no training in reconnaissance, combat or colluding\nI'm calling for my orders, over\n(STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!)\nI was standing at attention with a pocket full of weapons\nAnd the will to walk a mile in the same fatigues that I slept in\nI have yet to find a day in life worthy of my saluting\nI'm calling for my orders, over\n(STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI shimmy up out of the fox-hole, disorderly\nOnly after having logged every cadaver accordingly\nHigh scores keep our Tama-tongs enthralled\n(There is no cause iller than no cause at all)\nOkay, if his perspective is merked, sneaky detective work is aborted\nAnd it's no longer whisper-mode on the red alert\nNo bed of dirt sniper rifle peeking out the bunker (uh!)\nNow I'm center city looking for something to puncture (*gunshot*)\nHelp me up, the numbers of the heroes sat at suppers\nTreat the public like a tin can, riddled before it plummets (Brrrap!)\nBut, adrenaline can lead to lazy-eye hassles\nSo he missed the little boy inch the pin out the pineapple (Heh)\nThats funny...Bumps into the steel-toe\nThats lovely, sum it up in (Oh, hell no!)\nAnd just as quick as the parachute cable snipped\nI was rag-doll, horizontal, two limbs short of fixed\nLink a baby pool around the standard issued weaponry\nWhile fading as a blemish in civility's memory\nThey will step over the body for the looting..\n(Ready on the firing line)\n(The fuck is that?)\nSTRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!\n\n[Hook]\nI have landed safely\nI have not recieved my papers\nI have zero natural enemies\nI don't know my location\nI have no training in reconnaissance, combat or colluding\nI'm calling for my orders, over\n(STRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!)\nI was standing at attention with a pocket full of weapons\nAnd the will to walk a mile in the same fatigues that I slept in\nI have yet to find a day in life worthy of my saluting\nI'm calling for my orders, over\nSTRAP ON A HELMET AND START SHOOTING!
