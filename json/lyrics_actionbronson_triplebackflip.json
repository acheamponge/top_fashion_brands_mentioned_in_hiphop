Motherfucker I'm a sicko\nFucko, amethyst on the knuckle\nOn the arm, something Spanish with a bubble\n\n[Hook: Action Bronson]\nUh, it's big trouble in Little China\nAll of the china hidden inside of a big vergina\nUh, I'll pile drive her through the bed\nHit the strip, get my motherfucking bread, don't you say a word, bitch\nI need the gators just to match the vest\nHave my apprentice put the stainless to a bastard's chest\nCome out the sweatsuit\nDo a triple back flip into the red coupe\nSkrrrt, we out\n\n[Verse 2]\nCome...hold my dick while I take a piss\nShake it off, put it back in my boxer shorts\nRide in the drop top lobster Porsche\nInside the joint I got some pasta sauce\nUh, stalking the street, just to put the fork in the beef\nCoffins are cheap, seats are very soft in the Jeep\nThe lights hit me at the club, my skin was like a chicken\nAnd now my leather to the ankle by my Pippen\nThis feels crazy and I hoping I don't blow it\nThat goes to show I'm still a human under all this glow\nNeedless to say I'm exceeding while you pussies bleeding\nI guess your weight was not in season\nBreezing\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Triple Backflip", "album": "Saaab Stories", "image": "https://images.genius.com/661250cc679db57ceede833855e82710.460x461x1.jpg", "year": "2013-06-11"}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
