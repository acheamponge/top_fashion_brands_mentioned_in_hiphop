My arm did it twitch?\nI need a bed and a pharmacist quick\nNo parking that's it\nI need to get out the car and like quick\nI'm freaking out and it's hard to resist\nI need to get to my a-parta-ment...\n\n[Wrek talking to himself]\n\n[Verse 2: Wrekonize]\nOkay, I'm losing my mind\nVoice in my head says I'm doing just fine\nParking my car way outside of the line\nI'll just come back and re-park it in time\nAnything get me inside\nWhy is the thermostat on sixty-five?\nWhy am I freezing my freaking behind?\nMy blood pressure high, I think I'mma die\nI think I'mma die [3x]\n\n[Guitar Interlude while Wrek talks to himself checking on his car]", "title": "Green Funyuns", "year": null, "album": "The Rooftops Mixtape", "image": "https://images.genius.com/88e068903a4f33a883dd03382fcde905.700x700x1.jpg"}]}
