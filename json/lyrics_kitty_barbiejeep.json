I can tell you're having trouble\nThe struggle is real, and you wanna feel up on my stubble\nYou're gonna pop my bubble, you muggle\nPretend to stumble any closer\nI'll send you up in the air: wingardium leviosa\nWanna boast about it? On the other hand\nIf you wanna look close to me, do the hover hand\nAnd tell your brothers whatever, honey, I'll understand\nYou're just another \"whatever\", you're just another fan\n\n[Bridge]\nIs it too hot to dance?\nNo, we rock steady\nIs it too hot to dance?\nNo, we rock steady\nIs it too hot to dance?\nNo, we rock steady\nAnd I'm light on my feet 'cause I'm not top heavy\n\n[Chorus]\nI can be your Nancy, and you can be my Sid\nBaby, I've been sittin' fancy and I've been sittin' pretty\nI don't really want your hands in my general vicinity\nBut if you wanna say we're dan-dancing, I'll let you say we did\nYou know I can't dance, you know I can't dance\nBut you want me to\nYou know I can't dance, I can't dance\nYou know I can't dance, but I'll dance\nAnd I'll dance and we'll dance\nYou can be my Sid\nBaby, I've been sittin' fancy and I've been sittin' pretty\nI don't really want your hands in my general vicinity\nBut if you wanna save a dan-dance"}]}
