We keep it goin\u2019\nOn and on and on and on and on and (let\u2019s keep it goin\u2019) (x3)\nOn and on and on\n\n[Verse 1: Akrobatik]\n\nI heard \u2018em say \u2018money over bitches\nIf you know the difference between what a queen and a bitch is, you\u2019ll always have riches\nAnd you and I are now a unit to get this\nSo anything that\u2019s not on your wish list is dismissed\nI wanna get you wide open like a deep threat\nMake it last forever like Keith Sweat\nWe both agree there\u2019s opportunities that we\u2019ll each get\nBut let\u2019s agree that jealousy\u2019s a place we\u2019ll never reach \u2013 bet? (please, yes)\nPlease just continue to bless me with your presence\nImpress me with your essence, and flex your effervescence\n\u2018Cuz you sparkle like bubbly \u2013 so damn lovely\nHow much more lucky could a brother be than this discovery\nOther duos ain\u2019t half as strong, won\u2019t last half as long\nMaybe it\u2019s because their math is wrong\nWe\u2019re solid as a rock, like Ashford and Simpson\nYou found a brother\u2019s heart\u2019s password, and you went in\n\n[Chorus: Akrobatik and Dutch ReBelle]\n\nThis love is built to last\nI wanna tell the world about it\nBaby put it on blast\nWe let it marinate when we coulda gone fast\nBut this love is built to last\nSee. We keep it goin\u2019\nOn and on and on and on and on and (let\u2019s keep it goin\u2019) (x3)\nOn and on and on\n\n[Verse 2: Dutch ReBelle]\n\nLike the last two bars in my verse \u2013 that\u2019s where you\u2019re crucial\nI\u2019m positive that negative\u2019s blurred, you keep me neutral\nSo all my ladies give you respect, my dude\u2019s salute you\n\u2018Cuz pictures can get fuzzy when the funny wanna shoot you\nBut when you\u2019re in my flash, you\u2019re quick to crack a smile\nFeel like we're runnin' laps, still go the extra mile\nLiving like a joyride when I crashed into you\nLeaving parties, wrapping food up in some plastic for you\nMy past filled with you, I\u2019m staying on this pathway with you\nJust so I can spend my last day with you\nThey don\u2019t know about the half I would do, staying true\nIf we ever get in trouble much, skipping through \u2013 no double dutch\nWe talk, sharing lessons with no chalk\nNot mad, Boo, that\u2019s just the way I talk\nToo hard not to keep you in my thoughts\nStyle chic from your kiss down to your locks \u2013 on the clock for ya\n\n[Chorus]\n\nThis love is built to last\nI wanna tell the world about it\nBaby put it on blast\nWe let it marinate when we coulda gone fast\nBut this love is built to last\nSee, we keep it goin\u2019\nOn and on and on and on and on and (let\u2019s keep it goin\u2019) (x3)\nOn and on and on\n\nWe keep it goin\u2019\nUh, uh on\u2026\nWhat up", "title": "Let\u2019s Keep It Goin\u2019", "album": "Built To Last "}], "artist": "Akrobatik"}
