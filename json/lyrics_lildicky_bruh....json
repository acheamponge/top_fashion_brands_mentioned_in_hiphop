bruh, bruh\nLD, aka stem cells\n\n[Verse]\nEverybody know the cat like a dope meme\nI got em' buzzing off the crack like a dope fiend\nThey saw 'em come up with a Mac, yeah, I'm so Steve\nNowadays, bitches tryna crack, got 'em ODing\nLike, how them hoes want to get it with L?\nThey know it's cold enough to charge, like a letterman sale\nIf they gon' stand behind the bars, I'm in federal jail\nI'm going far like a general mail\nOn that note, I got the fellas saying \"What up,\" the tape, what up?\nThe same motherfucker playing with his steak cut up\nI'm great, shut up, the flowing, no debate, just us\nI'm out of shape, but I'm straight to fuck\nYeah, you know I got a chicken in the condo\nI was sick of getting off beat, she a bongo\nNow she playing with the hard D, being Rondo\nDrunk and go inside her all sweet like a Strongbow\nHow I'ma do?\nI got your ex coming next like a W do\nI gotta flex, I'm the best, now I'm being direct\nI'm unimpressed by these bitches that I see in the press\nI'm kinda vexed by the trash like I'm cleaning a mess\nCause they as real when they rap as a Chia's a pet\nThey old news, stocks plummet, men's leg hair, they ain't cut it\nForget about your era, Pat Summitt\nFinesse writtens\nI wanna get a hundred bitches and fuck with the spitting\nReligious like a couple of post-marital Christians\nI've been official, Dick Bevetta a living\nYou better dig it like you bitches got a mill in the ditch\nI'm killing this shit I been kicking like a villainous ninja\nMy shit is gripping when I run it, how the fuck I be slipping?\nI be intimate with them hoes, she never flummoxed\nI take chick, pee, and smash, I call it hummus\nAnd I be funny with this shit, I'm just playing\nBut still nobody fucking with the kid, I'm just saying, ah\nGot a chicken parm on the date, it seem\nBut I don't even know the broad, she just grating the cheese\nI don't even got a job, I just blaze and free\nBut still they give a boy bands, 98 Degrees\nSo come fuck with me\nI got a couple hundred bitches doing drugs with me\nAnd I got a couple dozen bitches tryna hug Dicky\nAnd I got a couple bitches who be steady fucking me\nHey, that's a good ass life\nOnly thing I got left, find a good ass wife\nBut yo, I gotta hit these hoes first, don't tell Mom\nBut in a year I'ma bend over Michelle Obama\nBruh, you know I gotta do it while I'm hot\nI'm tryna get blew in most states, like Barack\nI'm tryna show a boo the last name of the Rock\nAnd put her on D till we O, J Watt\nI never hit the scene, when I do, I'm high and wasted\nI'm fucking with them jeans, love them bitches high waisted\nI run around your team, you a player but I'm Naismith\nAnd I Command V, while you copy, I just paste it, face it\nHotel got 'em puffing on the L, going harder than some hail, you ain't knew it\nIf everybody had to tell the truth and you had to pick a dude spitting better than your dude, can't do it\nTelling me, damn, you got bitches, damn, you got hoes\nDamn, you got money, but damn, I got flow\nDamn, you got riches, damn, you got clothes\nDamn, you got honeys, but damn, I got soul, hold up\nThis shit I'm making's always tight, it's like a yoga store\nThey all up in the other boat, it's why I'm overboard\nI'm taking time to do it right, it's like a soda pour\nCause we ain't loving all you bitches like we spoken for\nI been packing the band-wagon, the man cracking\nThe man packing the stands, had them clapping they hands\nTagging they Grams, Manhattan was ham\nSlapping the fans, playing having the plan\nFans rapping the jams, sagging my pants\nYou see the type of shit I do on the track?\nHot shit, like I poop in the jacket\nWon't mack your bitch, but yo, I'm bout to come and mack your clique\nYour whole friend group fucking with Dick (no hetero)\nI yawn when I hear these motherfuckers on the radio\nThey ball all retarded, Cuba Gooding up in radio\nI long for the moment I can say that's not debatable\nI'm past that, I wonder who appreciate it like a Snapchat\nAflac, duck the dude, I'm going hard for the grind, but I tuck this move\nI made war with the rhymes, motherfuck your crew\nThese bitches going Adolf, tryna fuck this Jew\nI'm too nice, like a motherfucker that fell in love with a boo twice\nAs in double as fuckable as he was and dude tries\nTo be subtle and get her cuddling\nVenting her troubles and getting her truffles\nAnd ending up befuddled when she don't fuck him\nAnd someone tell him, \u201cListen, you bugging\nShe never fucking a pedestrian muggle like you\nSo why all the trouble?\u201d but he rebuttal with\n\"I think I just love her, so I would shudder at the thought\nOf being anything other than nice?\" (I\u2019m that nice)\nHeat bang like I caught a body/port-a-potty\nIt wasn't even deep, dang, shit is still a hobby\nIt's two bad bitches sleeping on me, threesome\n'Cause now these bitches want to help, but he don't need none\nI'm all time, like the Wall at the Bank\nYou've no shot, like you drawing a blank\nHonestly, you probably couldn't hang, man, I've been drawing a blank\nGiving you lines, while you sitting there and drawing a blank\nSo go in the rink, chilling like it's dough in the bank\nAnd I\u2019m flowing danker than a grower in Napa\nGrowing the stankest cannabis\nDoing rap and pro-est smacking the hoe-est rappers\nAnd showing the total package, like my flaccid is growing fatter\nSamoan cracker, dapper rapper, had to keep going\nYeah, that rap is a rap, I know you rappers napping, don't know it\nThere\u2019s a dagger pita pappa, tapping on the window\nIt\u2019s a real accurate metaphor of what you having in store\nAnd I be snapping, I mean I be splashing on the - pane me your rain\nFalling quicker than Aladdin for his dame\nOh, you better than me?\n\n[Outro]\nBruh"}], "artist": "Lil Dicky"}
