But it\u2019s not\nStill for a minute I got in a rut\nImprisoned, I was limited and feeling stuck\nHad my glass half empty, had to fill it up\nNow I think I wanna get myself a bigger cup\nThat\u2019s how the cards are dealt\nWill it stay that way? Only time will tell\nWhen I, think I wanna cry for help\nI just try remind myself\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Styalz Fuego]\nThere ain't no limit to us now\n'Cause eventually always comes around\nOh whether we die old or whether we die young\nGotta live it up till it\u2019s gone\n\n[Chorus: Stylaz Fuego & Dennis Dowlut (360)]\nLive it up till it\u2019s gone\nLive it up till it\u2019s gone\nLive it up till it\u2019s gone\nLive it up till it\u2019s gone\nLive it up till it\u2019s gone\nLive it up till it\u2019s gone (gotta live it up)\n\n[Verse 3: 360 & Pez]\nI don\u2019t know what the future holds\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll achieve my goals\nI just know life\u2019s beautiful\nMaybe that\u2019s 'cause I\u2019m living on cruise control\n'Cause truth be told it doesn\u2019t matter if ya\nMake it the whole way up the ladder, just as\nLong as you\u2019re living out your dream\nThey used to tell me it was out of reach, but now\nI am flying at a thousand feet\nNever looking at the ground beneath\nSee I got rid of all the doubt in me\nWho I was ain\u2019t shit on what I\u2019m about to be, because\nGrowing up all I heard was the same story\nAnd if I don\u2019t learn well the blames on me\nSo I started saying yes today\nTo all the things I said \u2018no\u2019 to yesterday\n\n[Outro: Styalz Fuego]\nOh, whether we die old or whether we die young\nGotta live it up till it\u2019s gone\nLive it up till it's"}]}
