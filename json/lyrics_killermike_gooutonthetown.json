"lyrics": "[Hook: Young Jeezy]\nThis the shit that happen when we go out on the town\nThis the shit that happen when we go out on the town\nBottles get to popping and them bitches get to jocking\nAnd the kush bag that we smoking on be loud\n\nThis the shit that happen when we go out on the town\nThis the shit that happen when we go out on the town\nBottles get to popping and them bitches get to jocking\nAnd the kush bag that we smoking on be loud\n\n[Verse One: Killer Mike]\nPull up to the club, you can hear the car running\nTip the door man, so you know I got a gun in\nPromoter already paid my money\nI'mma make it rain on sugar and honey\nBigga baby Bigga baby, ball like a dawg\nIt's enough of me to go 'round for both of y'all\nMe and my clique, we the t-shirt gang\n50 niggas deep, going \"bang bang bang!\"\nBlack Tee, black tee, bottles in the air\nNiggas think J-Bo and Meech back here\nNiggas think Charles Black back on set\nNiggas think Tera White back on deck\nSo respect my mind, respect my grind\nWalk right past don't respect, don't mind\n20 young broads like a cheer leading squad\nAll they wanna do is hang out with the stars\nAll they wanna do is get high like the moon\nTake a nigga back to the hotel room\nSex, drugs, rap, roll, yeah we on it\nL.A. tonight, Miami in the morning\nKnow a nigga had to hit the King Of Diamonds\nKnow a nigga had to do the same shit again\nKnow my next show in the city of sin\nTip back home and we at it again\n\n[Hook: Young Jeezy]\nThis the shit that happen when we go out on the town\nThis the shit that happen when we go out on the town\nBottles get to popping and them bitches get to jocking\nAnd the kush bag that we smoking on be loud\n\nThis the shit that happen when we go out on the town\nThis the shit that happen when we go out on the town\nBottles get to popping and them bitches get to jocking\nAnd the kush bag that we smoking on be loud\n\n[Verse Two: Killer Mike]\nThe kush that I'm smoking so goddamn loud\nI can see the police standing through the crowd\nI can see these pretty women sweating my style\nI can see my old ho standing by the mile\nAway from the do' just looking at me\nHer best friend telling her to holla at me\nShe wanna say something but her pride don't let her\nMad cause the bitches that I'm with look better\nFuck that hate I celebrate\nStanding with some niggas in the N.B.A\nStanding with some niggas in the N.F.L\nBoth them niggas say they visit with a player\nYeah I'm a player, yeah I ball\nM.V.P. of the V.I.P\nAll the young niggas wanna be like Mike\nBetter put a 23 on me\nAll these hoes with me go dyke\nThere go 23 times three\nThey just wanna be high as a kite\nOn a spaceship in another galaxy\nY'all niggas think making a movie is a club\nI live my life IMAX 3D\nY'all niggas know it's big screen things on the scene\nLiving life HD 10 in your TV\n\n[Hook: Young Jeezy]\nThis the shit that happen when we go out on the town\nThis the shit that happen when we go out on the town\nBottles get to popping and them bitches get to jocking\nAnd the kush bag that we smoking on be loud\n\nThis the shit that happen when we go out on the town\nThis the shit that happen when we go out on the town\nBottles get to popping and them bitches get to jocking\nAnd the kush bag that we smoking on be loud\n\n[Verse Three: Young Jeezy]\nLet's go\nThirty car deep me, need the whole valet\nFrom everything new to the old Chevrolet\nHalf of them them bitches ain't got no tops\nHalf of them bitches park brand new drops\nAll them bitches got brand new wheels\nNone of my niggas ain't got no deal\nNone of my niggas ain't got no job\nAll of my niggas got 2 or 3 cars\nWhat you mean nigga ain't got no cares?\nLike telling OG she ain't go no ass\nDon't look now nigga, Sugar on the stage\nFive stack for the song, nigga Sug' got a raise\nHow you know a nig' got all that work?\nCause he got three/four XL shirts\nWhy a nigga name so hot in the city?\nCause he got three/four spots in the city\nIt's soft on the east, hard on the west\nSmoke on the south side y'all know the rest\n32 O then it ain't no plan\nNo income, no stone then it ain't no watch\nIs it in the front then it ain't no Coupe\nDidn't come from L.A. then it ain't no Snoop\nG.A. baby wanna smoke that brown\nYour name ain't Young then this ain't your town\nNothing said pussy like 3 Rosay\n[?] post screaming free Jose\nNothing said chip like Frito Lay\nKeep playing that Young/Mike, go DJ\nMatter of fact dawg, free all my niggas\nGotta cell phone 'bout to call my niggas\nKnow what I did then you might be a legend\nPlay it one more time then I might spend seven\n\n[Hook: Young Jeezy]\nThis the shit that happen when we go out on the town\nThis the shit that happen when we go out on the town\nBottles get to popping and them bitches get to jocking\nAnd the kush bag that we smoking on be loud\n\nThis the shit that happen when we go out on the town\nThis the shit that happen when we go out on the town\nBottles get to popping and them bitches get to jocking\nAnd the kush bag that we smoking on be loud"}]}
