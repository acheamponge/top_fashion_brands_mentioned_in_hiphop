We all used to cash collect\nInstead of catchin a body homey cash a check\nAny moment it could be over, your number's up\nYou become, a memory nobody's givin a fuck\nIt's no wonder how we cross roads and get divided\nThere's no, compromises and drama arises\nThe streets got you clutched in the cradle of doom\nYou get out of pocket they make you invisible dude\n\n[Hook]\n\n[B-Real]\nThe streets are ugly and the world is goin through changes\nWe fightin at home and out here in unknown places\nWe never know what peace is\nWe all about war for the money and the violence increases\nI never thought about it when I was younger\nI never thought about we all just numbers\nI only thought about the food on the table\nI was taught to make moves when you're ready and able\nSometimes you feel alone and you just simply go for self\nAnd you don't care about anybody else\nYou say \"Look at that trick in the flashy whip!\nIf I get my chance, you know I'm gonna jack his shit\"\nThe world's cold, people sell their soul\nFor money and power then they seem to lose control\nThey can't, handle the load at the end of the road\nThey're destined to fall and we just watch the drama unfold\n\n[Hook]\n\n{*Bo Roc ad libs to end*}", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a84f5f2a93fac34de0ebb0407f26b392.600x600x1.jpg", "year": null}]}
