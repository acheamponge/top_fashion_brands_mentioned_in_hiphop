"[Intro: Jazz Lazer]\nAyy\nAyy ayy ayy\n\n[Chorus: Jazz Lazer]\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\nHop out another foreign, all these niggas boring, they just tellin' stories, ayy\nRolls-Royces back to back, Maybach in back of that, watchin' 'em bend the corner, ayy\nThis one's from Germany, this one's from Italy, I know these niggas wish they could get rid of me, ayy\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\n\n[Verse 1: Philthy Rich]\nHop out another foreign while these diamonds jump out the face\nYour baby mama pussy borin', told that ho to hop out the Wraith\nIt's stars in my ceiling ho, centerfolds in my videos\nI talk shit and I swallow spit, but I don't never talk to no pillow ho\nPut in every foreign that nigga name, when I was broke, niggas didn't complain\nEverything big candy paint, your shit was sprayed with a can of paint\nIn the Bentley with the breitling on, AP in the Maserati\nHundred thousand in my left pocket\nAnd a bad bitch that's gon' sell her body\nNiggas play with me, they gon' check about it\nToo many bulletholes, they can't check the body\nI just placed a call, and I placed a hit\nNiggas pull up and get the check about it\nYour BM in my DM, I'm in a BM in the PM\nIf not nigga, I'm in the Audi thing\nJust copped another diamond chain, It's Philthy\n\n[Chorus: Jazz Lazer]\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\nHop out another foreign, all these niggas boring, they just tellin' stories, ayy\nRolls-Royces back to back, Maybach in back of that, watchin' 'em bend the corner, ayy\nThis one's from Germany, this one's from Italy, I know these niggas wish they could get rid of me, ayy\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\n\n[Verse 2: Yowda]\nWent from the Ghost to the drophead\nThe car look live but the top dead\nBad bitch on my passenger, she from North Africa\nGoons in the backseat, they mopheads\nI hit the valet and they drop dead\nMillion dollars in the driveway\nRappers lookin' at me sideways\nBut all this came up off the highway\nTried to tell them niggas crime pays\nNow it's tension 'cause they didn't listen\nMy neck glisten from the kitchen\nI'm shittin', boy my roof is missin'\nGot lamb on the floor, stars in the ceiling\nTint on the windows, it feel like I'm hidden\nThe ceiling console got a touch screen\nThe car do tricks as soon as I fill it\nMy money is up, same car as your idol\nThe engine purr like a kitten when it idle\nYou niggas is leasin' and I got the title\nThe engine V12 and the doors suicidal\nBallin' on these niggas like I was Michael\nJackson, Jordan, Tyson, and Bodine\nThis would be floatin', it feel like I'm boatin'\nA shark in this bitch and these streets is my ocean\n\n[Chorus: Jazz Lazer]\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\nHop out another foreign, all these niggas boring, they just tellin' stories, ayy\nRolls-Royces back to back, Maybach in back of that, watchin' 'em bend the corner, ayy\nThis one's from Germany, this one's from Italy, I know these niggas wish they could get rid of me, ayy\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\n\n[Verse 3: Zoey Dollaz]\nUh, Dade County\nHop out another foreign, with a bad bitch lookin' like she foreign, uh\nHop out another foreign, my whip so big, lookin' like we tourin'\nThese niggas mad 'cause they whip is borin'\nI'm ridin' 'round with young Steph Curry\nMy dog a shooter, he'll leave you buried\nMotherfuck a shooter, I shoot him, hit his medulla\nI left the dealer, had to get some new rims\nYour bitch wanna do 'em, ain't nothin' new\nBrand new S-550, look at the view\nI like the four door but I copped the coupe\nGot your bitch ridin' the shotgun, got another bitch behind her\nUh, so I got the two, ain't no question that I'm fuckin' your boo\n'Cause the foreign white and black like Pep\u00e9 Le Pew\n'Cause the foreign white and black like Pep\u00e9 Le Pew\n\n[Chorus: Jazz Lazer]\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\nHop out another foreign, all these niggas boring, they just tellin' stories, ayy\nRolls-Royces back to back, Maybach in back of that, watchin' 'em bend the corner, ayy\nThis one's from Germany, this one's from Italy, I know these niggas wish they could get rid of me, ayy\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy\nHop out another foreign, bitch I'ma hop out another foreign, ayy", "year": "2016-02-26"}]}
