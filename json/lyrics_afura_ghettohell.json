{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Afu-Ra]\nCradled in the womb of the metropolis, dodging hell swarm\nVision of going to heaven, nothing can stop this\nAlthough I'm optimistic, balance it with being realistic\nIs paradise is part of the plan, or scribbled in some book and shit\nIt all goes down as rain drops on my neighborhood, I love my hood\nAnd motherfucker this ain't good, crackheads selling dope to dope heads\nOn blocks that's rented by house niggas\nThat's all getting rich off of the bloodshed\nAnd as I experience, none the lesser, and it's high\nAnd it's high as I got off of the reefers\nThe balance levels of horror, yo, ain't never disappear\n\n[Chorus: Afu-Ra]]\nI know, you know\nIt's like we livin' in hell in the ghetto\nI know, you know\nBabies is dying in the ghetto\nI know, you know\nMothers are crying in the ghetto\nI know, you know\nIt's like we livin' in hell in the ghetto\nI know, you know\nLike that, like that, like that, like that\n\n[Afu-Ra]\nI put the pedal to the metal, heavy metal in the ghetto\nI ain't got to raise it, cause hell is the grimey ghetto\nI guess that's the catalist for so many fantasies\nWe can fantasize and happen to be surrounded by misery\nThe daughters and sisters, the little bitties\nPrincess inside ya beautiful\nBut mommy can't afford the sparkles and dresses\nAs a matter of fact, kids around here\nNeed to be walking with a vest on\nCause the quietest streets around here, can be a war zone\nAnd I'm in such disgust, cause the police\nInstead of protectin and serving, they serving us\nThey brutalizin' and battering, as a matter of fact\nThey play ghetto, officers, I see them laughing\nTrynna pick up girls in uniform\nHanging out them college dorms, we need some inform\nWhy is he a ghetto? cause society divided by nothing, but money, hello\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Afu-Ra]\nFrom city to city, all over the globe\nSo many poverty stricken lives, the facts'll make ya heads explode\nCities and families, all over, global over load\nFrom Brownsville to Russia, through Somalia through Croatia\nLyrics are live, fight to survive, it's a horror ride\nDemons coming for your hide, but there's no where to run\nStraight up, and there's no where to hide\nGuess what, cause negative situation is winning by a landslide\nAnd if you living this life, there's the worst schools\nAnd the worst doctors, guess what? Society got ya\n\n[Chorus]", "title": "Ghetto Hell", "album": "State of the Arts", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6641519bda508e451130d48bde3b5fe7.480x483x1.gif", "year": "2005-07-01"}], "artist": "Afu-Ra"}
