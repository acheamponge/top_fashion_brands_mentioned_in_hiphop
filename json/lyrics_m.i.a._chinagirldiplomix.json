Got with a geezer\nNeed some money? Paid him with a knees-up\nYear later, started to ease up\nGot her own way, shouted out \"see ya\"\n\n[Hook]\nShe skipped away to the shop\nShe found she didn't have enough\nShe clocked him looking right at her\nAnd sucked on a lollipop", "year": null, "album": "Piracy Funds Terrorism", "title": "China Girl (Diplo Mix)"}], "artist": "M.I.A."}
