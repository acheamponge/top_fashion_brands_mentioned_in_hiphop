Good]\n\n[Verse 1: XV]\nWe was just friends that would always run wild\nAstronaut dreamin', we could never come down\nWhen one night stands lead to a young child\nSo if we cut 'em always use a hat like Kung Lao\nWay before those square dudes came to run round\nWe was kings of the city, thought we would run towns\nBecame friends in days, but took years to build it\nIt's funny how in seconds that all could come down\nAnd it hurts now\nWe learn how to spit game and get turned down\nHoes got turned out, homies got shermed out\nTeachers told us \"Quiet down\", we left to burn that loud\nAin't right, I'm learning now, but that's life, it turned out, I was right\nY'all was only about dreamin' when it's convenient\nWhen we got recognized more than the voice of Morgan Freeman\nCouldn't force you to make this something you believe in\nSo I said peace, I'll be leaving screaming\n\n[Chorus: XV]\nGo on without me, why you beg me to stay\nGood luck with tomorrow, because I'm leaving today\n(I wish I could stay)\nBut I wish I could stay, hey\nI'm screaming go on without me, why you beg me to stay\nGood luck with tomorrow, because I'm leaving today\n(I wish I could stay)\nBut I wish I could stay, hey\n\n[Verse 2: XV]\nThe metal detectors detected him\nWhile the school districts neglected him\nPolice arrested him, told him he's like the rest of 'em\nSo gang life accepted him, real niggas respected him\nReal life rejected him, dreams, that's all that's left of him\nThey said he showed signs that I didn't take directions from\nThat was my dawg, damn, should've protected him\nWhat we said in that parking lot, I should've questioned him\nMade sure that his head was right, before I left with him\nBut it was that day, when his pops wouldn\u2019t ask\nHe would just whoop his ass for not taking out the trash\nI don't know the dialogue, I just heard he got mad\nClosed the bathroom door, all they heard was a blast\nI'm in the hallway crying\nThe counselor giving me guidance\nWishing I showed you this life before you went and decided\nCould I rewind and find a way to make you stay\nAnd prove, that wasn't the only way\nI say\n\n[Chorus: XV]\nGo on without me, why you beg me to stay\nGood luck with tomorrow, because I'm leaving today\n(I wish I could stay)\nBut I wish I could stay, hey\nI'm screaming go on without me, why you beg me to stay\nGood luck with tomorrow, because I'm leaving today\n(I wish I could stay)\nBut I wish I could stay, hey\n\n[Verse 3: XV]\nWhere was you when we were getting high\nRiding on an L7 jet up in the sky\nL.A. for the day, Vegas for the night\nTell me how'd you miss out on all this living life\nBut I get it right\nEverybody get a price and some people afford to pay\nIn the long run I hope you come up nothing short of great\nI just think it's sorta fake and there's probably more to say\nBut I've been carrying all this weight\nThat I've been sore all day\nAnd I don't got time to sit and jog around questions\nAbout the niggas I mess with and just who I'm addressing\nCause there's still some confessions\nThat I got to mail out\nThat I got to tell bout\nYea, I brought the real out\nSee, I might showboat but I'll never sell out\nSo that \"fuck your circle\" shit is all I ever yell out\nThat's what you do when you know your crew\nIs tough as boots and they fuck with you\nYou follow them, they don't follow you\nSo what you do, you told me\n\n[Chorus: XV]\nGo on without me, why you beg me to stay\nGood luck with tomorrow, because I'm leaving today\n(I wish I could stay)\nBut I wish I could stay, hey\nI'm screaming go on without me, why you beg me to stay\nGood luck with tomorrow, because I'm leaving today\n(I wish I could stay)\nBut I wish I could stay, hey\n\n[Post-Chorus: XV]\nSo go on without me\nI said go on without me\nSo go on without me\nI wish I could stay, hey\nBut go on without me\nI said go on without me\nSo go on without me\nI wish I could stay, hey\nBut go on without me\nI said go on without me\nJust go on without me\nI wish I could stay, hey"}], "artist": "XV"}
