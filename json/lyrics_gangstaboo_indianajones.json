Alright, so you want me to go back to that 90's shit, that shit that had everybody locking 'em in a trunk, hella high, snorting cocaine, smoking weed, robbing niggas and shit? That's what y'all want, I'mma give it to ya. I ain't a role model now, I'm just giving y'all what y'all want. You wanna take it back to the 90's, that 90's flow? Alright, ho, here we go\n\n[Verse 1]\nMask to my fucking face, I'm fiending to increase my high\nEyeballs is like red as hell, these bitches better recognize\nRolling a blunt to inhale in my lungs, I'm feeling so so high\nNow I'm high, really high; mayne, I think that I can fly\nChilling at the Honeycomb Hideout with my niggas who\nGot them choppers and Glocks not locked\nAnd best believe they ass'll shoot\nRatchet bitches all up in my mix with they pettiness\nBetter get the hell up out my face before a player click\nM-E-M-P-H-I-S, rep it like it's nothing left\nG-A-N-G-S-T-A -- here to stay, you hoes heard what I said\nCreeping through the darkness of the cut with my cousin Nate\nFear no evil, hear no evil -- got my Locs on face, I'm straight\nMeet me at the crib about a quarter to eight\nBring my package, don't be late\nCatch you slipping, you won't live\nCause niggas gotta pay they bills\nFall up in the jungle, hungry ape, go eat your face\nRip your heart up out your chest\nIndiana Jones, ya bitch\n\nI'm Indiana Jones, ya bitch\nI'm Indiana Jones, ya bitch\nRip your heart up out your chest\nIndiana Jones, ya bitch\nI'm Indiana Jones, ya bitch"}]}
