I need you to say it for me though, I need you to, say it one more time for me\nWhy you didn't catch me in the daytime?\nI wasn't at the studio yet\nOh my god, hold on, my phone about to cut off line\nDon't let it cut off, just scream it one more time for me\nBaby Jesus though!\nYeah, and I need you to uh... But I need more of that up-North accent on it. So just like that, but more of that up-North accent\nLucy, come say it\nNo, I want your voice\nShe from-She just came from Connecticut, so\nOkay, let me-Yeah, her too. Her too, that'll work\nCome here, Lucy\nHow do I say it?\nLike with your Richport accent, like, you're not from Conneticut, like a bird\nShe said \"I ain't saying that shit\"\nBaby Jesus though, no, ew, just like a bird\nShe said she sound like a bird. Okay, but these country niggas like that shit!\nThese country niggas like birds\nCome here, Elijah\nShe said she gotta get in bird mode\nShe gotta get in bird mode?\nAlright, what I'm sayin'? \"Pull it out, let me see it?\"\nYeah, \"Pull it out, let me see it.\"\nAlright, 123, can you do the 123? Say that\n1, 2, 3\nPull it out, let me see it\nThank you so much", "album": "So Disrespectful", "year": "2015-09-25", "title": "Like A Bird (Interlude)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5fff303436ce317346b2deeb6b74d79e.910x910x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DaBaby"}
