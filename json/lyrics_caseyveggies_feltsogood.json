Oh, you don't want that\nSo I guess I'm on some other shit now\nI went to school and I went to practice\nI came home like, what's happening\nTurned some beats on, wrote some raps and\nI guess that's what clear up how I'm acting\nMusic is the only thing that give me satisfaction\nAnwar hit me and it's time for some action\nSo now I'm worried bout mapping out my plans\nAnd I swear all of y'all should understand\nGod damn, damn\nUh, cause it get like that\nThen it switch right back\nSame shit like that\nMake a nigga wanna stop and switch right back\nBut then shit turn right\nLike just to the hood cause my life got right\nYeah, and it felt so good, do you feel me\nYeah, I said it felt so good, do you feel me\nYeah, I said it felt so good, do you feel me\n\n[Outro: Kent Jamz]\nDo you feel me?\nDo you feel me?\nDo you feel me?\nI don't think you feel me\nI don't think you feel me\nI don't think you feel me\nI don't think you feel me\nI don't think you feel me\nI don't think you feel me\nI don't think you feel me\nI don't think you feel me\nDo you feel me?\nDo you feel me?"}]}
