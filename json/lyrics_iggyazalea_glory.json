I bought the Murda Bizness to all of them\nThey asking questions like I ain't talking about dressing\nAre we talking about art, or are we talking about perception?\nIf it bangs play my record, if not, then shelf it\nWhile others coming up shorter than elf limbs\nI realize I may be the realest bitch they ever dealt with\nAnd to be honest these rumours be all fables\nSee, I don\u2019t get dropped, I drop the label\nLet\u2019s keep it very clear, I\u2019m doing just fine\nI\u2019m sitting on a million, your bank\u2019s flatline\nDeath to the haters, face it one time\nYou got your own dick bitch\nWhy you ridin' mine?\n\n[Hook:]\nKick me down but I\u2019m a champion\nHeard them say that I'm not the one\nNevermind them, never-nevermind them\nNevermind them, never-nevermind them\nCarry the weight like a champion\nGo sell the dreams to the other ones\nNevermind them, never-nevermind them\nNevermind them, never-nevermind them\n\n[Verse 2:]\nI never learned to fail, all I know is win\nThe haters shoot me down, can\u2019t help but crash land\nI get up walking, they still talking it never ends\nThey build me up to break me down it builds me up again\nOn my Twin Tower shit, even when I\u2019m gone\nThey gon\u2019 pay to see where I\u2019ve been\nI ain\u2019t do this shit alone but it ain't take many friends\nNow I understand the song, many men, many men\nIt\u2019s only so long, fake bitches can\u2019t pretend\nI\u2019m gone with the wind, they can\u2019t even catch my drift\nThe hate keep you from hearing, well, fuck it, read my lips\nThere\u2019s some things I never do; never lose, never quit\nNever change who I am, never give a fuck who gives a shit\nI\u2019m drunk off life, of course I\u2019m swerving in and shit\nI\u2019m in the zone throne empty I\u2019ma take a sit\nAnd like my girl Tiny all these haters on my Tip\n\n[Hook:]\nKick me down but I\u2019m a champion\nHeard them say that I'm not the one\nNevermind them, never-nevermind them\nNevermind them, never-nevermind them\nCarry the weight like a champion\nGo sell the dreams to the other ones\nNevermind them, never-nevermind them\nNevermind them, never-nevermind them\nKick me down but I\u2019m a champion\nHeard them say that I'm not the one\nNevermind them, never-nevermind them\nNevermind them, never-nevermind them\nCarry the weight like a champion\nGo sell the dreams to the other ones\nNevermind them, never-nevermind them\nNevermind them, never-nevermind them\nKick me down but I\u2019m a champion\nHeard them say that I'm not the one\nNevermind them, never-nevermind them\nNevermind them, never-nevermind them\nCarry the weight like a champion\nGo sell the dreams to the other ones\nNevermind them, never-nevermind them\nNevermind them, never-nevermind them", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4049551c786a5687d6d0190a8a138940.475x475x1.jpg", "album": "Glory - EP", "year": null}]}
