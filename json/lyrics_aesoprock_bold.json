Armchairs, Underoos\nCamera's on the entrances, TV's on The Bugaloos\nSpeaking of, what's up with you's? Y'all tried chilling?\nNo, whole time bow tie spinning, like \"Hzzzzzz...\"\nCough cough sputter, not to worry, there will always be another\nI wanna say I nurtured all you little green settlings\nBut these lapses get the guillotine snapping, it's distracting\nAll-righty, play me what bumps\nYuck, I'm getting too old for this, shucks\nAes stay gold for this much\nGray and mostly tits up\nOld man winter, eyes on the prize\nGive the lowest of lives, the highest of fives\n'Cause...\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Rob Sonic]\nWassup breezy, it's the brush fire\nPut Vicks on my chest like I'm Russ Meyer\nI love Breyers, but I'm dumb tired\nWhen they say \"based,\" I say \"safe\" like an umpire\nThey say waders are lame with the brush binder\nDaryl Hall hair is bald as a bus tire\nJanitorial and we're sore when his funk fibres\nStart moving pip-squeaks like I'm Keith on a drum riser\nUp in the club krumpin' - what up shorty?\n\"Yo, what are you, like 40?\"\nThat's a whole other story with rips in the root page\nAnd if age is just a number it's bugging it's room mates\nLike dudes, keep it down you're driving me Bruce Wayne\nAnd I'm three floors down and still hearing your 2Chainz\nOh that's One Direction well regardless dude\nIt's not Nas getting live at the barbecue\nSo tomorrow dude just keep the drama calm\nBecause it's not funny when you call me Big Papa John\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Busdriver]\nI am not here at the Raise A Roof or Parallax for feral cats\nI'm in the same age group as Darryl Mac\nAsk these slender teens if the denture cream is in stock\nEngendered of remembered dreams in my inbox\nOf [???] denim jeans or Gwendoline's like, \"Pick rocks\"\nNow my bum knee and limbs pop like rimshots\nAnd twenty-something's hard to compromise movie tropes\nWhile my aftershave is some homogenized Uzi smoke\nSo how can I optimize the booty stroke\nWhile my sole possesion is a fossilized dookey rope\nI mean I got etchings in my worry lines\nBut how the dream rings off the the precipice of thirty-nine\nIt's depressing, some pre-dating toe tags\nSpell checking in a suicide note drafts\nY'all pull vintage tees out of them tote bags\nI got a vintage me that is visibly cro-mag", "title": "Bold", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/64fbb9620a6b5e79e87c654b74da5441.640x640x1.jpg", "year": "2013-05-13"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
