Wall Street occupation\nMe? I'll occupy Wall Street like the protest just to discuss interest rates and inflation\nNot stocks and bonds, but\nContusions and knots, fractions and blood coagulation\nMy medication is next to go\nBut I'ma get it out of Canada or Mexico\nI need cash in hand with extra dough\nFor my albuterol and my Lexapro\nGive me my money\n\n[Chorus: Pharoahe Monch]\nGive me my motherfucking money\nI want my goddamn money\nIn 24 hours you better have my money\nI got bills and shit, I need medicine\nRoof over my head, Con Edison\nI need it\nI want it\n\n[Bridge: Pharoahe Monch (Lil' Fame)]\nNow they gon' make me drop a name on 'em (Say what?)\nTotally inflict pain on 'em (Say what?)\nI'ma get insane on 'em\nThey sayin' I'm sick so I'm a sick Lil' Fame on 'em\n\n[Verse 2: Lil' Fame & Pharoahe Monch]\nYou got 24 hours to pay me my bread or you don't owe me nothing (Ante up!)\n'Cause when I see you, you gon' get yo' head busted\nI don't care if they rob Peter just to pay Paul\nPeter gon' fuck around and get his ass Peter Rose\nScratch a match, burn that bitch for clownin' with Jamal\nTaxiderm that bitch and mount him on the wall (Okay)\nTime tickin'\nAll you gon' hear is that nine clickin'\nI'm tryna get rich or die tryin'\nGot my niggas speakin' to my son like\nDon't worry, Claude, you gon' get them Sneakers (That's right)\nThat's what a nigga get for fuckin' with them leeches (Oh)\nCould've furnished your crib with all the deluxe features (Oh)\nCaptain underground, you are just a lieutenant (Nigga)\nI'm a Brownsvillain with a chest full of ribbons (Nigga)\nIt was 23 hours and a couple minutes\nI threw that bird into a safe, she had my money plus interest\nI said\n\n[Chorus: Pharoahe Monch]\nGive me my motherfuckin' money\nI want my goddamn money\nIn 24 hours you better have my money\nI got bills and shit, I need medicine\nRoof over my head, Con Edison\nI need it\nI want it\n\n[Outro: Pharoahe Monch]\nI need it\nWant it\nNeed it\nWant it", "year": "2018-10-31"}]}
