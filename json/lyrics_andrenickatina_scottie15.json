Dip to find that weed\nIn that sedan de ville cadilac wit' the gangsta lean\nI gots to pop me a knot\nSoon as we hit the spot\nSo I can hit the ho twice and see how much cash she got\nMe and 'Dre will hop out\nWhen we hit the parking lot\nAnd get to flossin' on them fools like I pulled up at the postop\nJumped out the car and we was feelin' like g's\nI was broke that day but lookin' like I slang keys\nBut these hoes will never know\nCuz them ones will have you fat\nWhen you off in one of them clubs and dressing all in black\nAnd it was cool I had juice to get in with a strap\nIn case I see one of them niggas from back in the days I done jacked\nIn fact\nMy nigga shot done served that nigga a sac\nAnd told me that he had 3 mo' niggas posted out back\nBring this on\nCuz right by the back door is my cuzin tone\nAnd mr. blunt\nReady to give some nike reading lessons to a chump\nWe make them bleed\nThen leave the seen\nWit them a.r. 15's\nA.r. 15's\n(andre nickatina)\nMan I don't drink cappuccino\nI'm a Pisces not a Leo\nCan't even strike to Reno unless I tell my fuckin' p.o\nDrinkin pina colata Boone staring hard at the moon\nOn the eighteenth floor of the hotel tryna find my room\nFive star\nAddictive like liquor at the bar\nI sell tapes nigga bring it on, cash or MasterCharge?\nI gets lower than a den when I'm strikin' on a mission\nLookin' for competition\nOr maybe a couple bitches\nMy style is something deadly like a Newport cigarette\nI'm a street chemist bitch\nA money hungry pit\nLike daffy duck I gives a fuck\nIt's mines it's all mines\nCatch up like Heinz\nCuz I'll leave that ass behind\nCome stick with me\nI'll bumble like a bee\nCuz my boo\nWe was cool\nBack in nine two\nBut check it\nI hit the party I sees niggas hoes and weed\nAnd my homeboys wandered in and don't wanna leave\nYa know what? I think not\nYa know we hate cops\nImagine if nigga bought\nEvery donut shop\nIn the city\nFuck it in the muthafuckin' world\nGreasy like a curl\nPriceless like a pearl\nStrikin' like a lighter\nBitin' like a biter\nBitch did you recognize my whitewall tires?\n(shaggy)\nYeah man I recognize your whitewall tires, but we got to get this over with\nYou understand me. I'm makin' moves I can't be standing around it might have\nBeen a good day for you,but I'm a tell you it'll never be right\n\nI stepped outside and I was tweaking\nSo tipsy mentally geekin'\nI seen my nephew he had just got plug\nHe gave me credit he hooked me up with a proper dubb\nHere come my girl I hope she got a pipe\nIt might of been a good day for you, Dre but for me it'll never be right\nI must have been geekin' and I stole my mama's t.v\nNow my little cousin and my nephew wanna see me\nBut I ain't lookin' for them,I lookin' for a triple beam\nAnd I'll be back later on cuz I heard you niggas got ice cream\nSomething fat never that soda\nFuckin wit the mexicans ya'll be havin' that peruvian yola\nStraight butt naked a dobe fiends dream\nNextellin' ain't no tellin' when I put it on a triple beam\nI love that bitch if ya know what I mean\nBut I ain't talkin' bout that skanless,I'm talkin bout that ice cream"}]}
