Pretend I'm hot food and blow me\nLeave me alone like an island, [?]\nYou do it for the homies? I do it for the honeys\nYou do it for the money? I do it for the mam\u00eds\nI'm selfish, what you want from me?\nI just made 20, so I'm still a rugrat like Tommy\nBut it's better this way\nStill a rookie, but we celebrating...\n\n[Chorus: Charles Hamilton & brandUn DeShay]\nVeterans Day\nAnd everybody know who I am, even though I'm pretty sure you don't\nVeterans Day\nGive me love I deserve, pretty sure I'm pretty sure you don't\nVeterans Day\nIt's 11/11 again, it's 11/11 again\nIt's 11/11 again\nThe day after my birthday is\n\n[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]\nMaybe I'll be the greatest alive the day that I die\nHatred is fine, I cannot wait for the time\nI drop album after album\nAnd you sit in the studio, realizing you're wasting your time\nThe game isn't mine; the motherfucking console is\nCharles Sega, Carl Sagan, on some Cosmos shit\nGet hated by those who do not know shit\nThey pot roasting my lyrical osmosis\nI gotta fight to be one of the individuals\nI got a right to be someone none of you niggas know\nI sit at home, I'm trying to keep my sanity\nWanna nut in my girl so I can feed my family\nWanna smoke a pound of haze, blow an ounce of yay\nOverdose, but I know I told you folks I found a way\nOut the caves that my mind designed\nSo you don't mind, I don't, it's my time to shine\n\n[Chorus: Charles Hamilton & brandUn DeShay]\nVeterans Day\nAnd everybody know who I am, even though I'm pretty sure you don't\nVeterans Day\nGive me love I deserve, pretty sure I'm pretty sure you don't\nVeterans Day\nIt's 11/11 again, it's 11/11 again\nIt's 11/11 again\nThe day after my birthday is\n\n[Verse 3: brandUn DeShay]\nThey say 'cause I appeal like a orange, all the girls got a crush on me\nNever been bullied, but everybody pushing me to greatness\nSo all of that hating don't mean much to me\n'Cause ain't nobody touching me, molesters get custody\nAnd they try to question me, thinking I'm the shit\nI ain't shit, I'm trying to change the world before I split\nSee?
