C-Note oh my God! yeah oh my God!\n\n\n\n[Verse: C-Note]\nC-Note oh my God! Whoa I can't be stopped\nI see myself in the bigger picture and it ain't photoshopped\nYeah Oh my God!\nI know im gonna make it and I put that on my guys\nI know haters trying to put me down but guess what? Still I rise\nYeah yeah\nI dont think they know who they fuckin with\nI get the bag, I flip it, I get it tumbling\nStepping over these haters I'm never stumbling\nThrowing squares out my circle, royal rumbling\nSo stay away from me\nAnd this is my shot I won't fadeaway\nYoung nigga getting paid today\nIf you play about my cash I turn to Cassius Clay\nBAR$ heavyweight, knock em out\nCall up Nick Cannon cause I'm wild'n out\nYeah I'm going crazy, yeah im spazzing out\nGoing looney on them tunes, man I'm tazzin out\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: C-Note]\nAye\nReal talk, I feel so confident in this song right now\nI ain't even gonna rap no more on it\nI ain't gotta put another verse on it, I ain't gotta put another hook on it\nMatter of fact I ain't gon say shit else\nImma let my beat play on you weak ass niggas\nHaaan"}]}
