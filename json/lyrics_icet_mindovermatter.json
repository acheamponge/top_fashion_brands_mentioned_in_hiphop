Your face hits the concrete\nYou wanna roll\nWith the niggas that don't play\nI think you got false courage\nGet out my damn way\nCause the car I'm in\nIs rolling full of men\nNot kids or boys, E got the Mac 10\nIslam's got the Zulu Nation back up\nDJ Aladdin to\nHook the fucking track up\nSyndicate's making the move\nWith the ski masks\nAnd I'm housing the long cash\nSo now you realize\nYou underestimated the Ice\nYou thought that I was OK\nBut now you realize I'm nice\nBut that's alright\nCause I knew I'd make it in the end\nThose who like me now\nMight not have liked me then\nBut I'mma keep impressing\nStressing my lesson\nAnd keep motherfuckers guessing\nArmor plate my mind\nWith walls and shields\nAs I escape from the killing fields\n\n[Hook]\n(I can understand)\nMind over matter\n(I know what it means)\n(Mind power)\nMind over matter\n(Mind over matter)\nMind over matter\n(Mind over matter)\nMind over matter\n(Mind over matter)\n\nWise up\nMove to the tempo of this hype groove\nYou know this shit is dope\nSo what you trying to prove\nVU's max as Evil E\nMy nigga dogs the wax\nMy brain's a hand grenade--catch\nI'mma hit you with an overload\nOf bottomless thought\nReversing all the shit you're taught\nThen throw words at you\nSyl-la-ble-at-a-time\nYour brain recites the rhyme\nNo matter what you do\nThe power's over you\nWhen you sleep\nYou'll be saying these rhymes too\nCause the brain has the power\nTo control all\nThink positive\nYou'll be unable to fall\nBrain cells swell\nThought process becomes a trance\nMakes you feel possessed to dance\nI'll say I want a million\nMy mind is so deep\nI'll be busting a check for it next week\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8ba43671bb57813daf61c8431aebd0ea.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "O.G.
