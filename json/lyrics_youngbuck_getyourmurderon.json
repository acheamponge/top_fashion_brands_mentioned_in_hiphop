Better calm down your woman\nAnd that shit in that plastic bag better be all hundreds\nWhen my mask down, that mean I'm ready to blast now\nTaught your ass a lesson, bet you'll learn how to act now\n\n[Hook: repeat 2X]\nGet your murder on - cock it back and let it go\nBitch I represent them killers who be kickin in them do's\nGet your muder on - black down from head to toe\nSee I tried to tell you once niggas don't want war\n\n[Verse Two]\nJust look at life from my point of view, run where I call home\nFeel what a gun do and I'll bet you {?}\nWonder why my mind strong livin the life\nWhen niggas really don't live long playin me sheist\nSee I'm goin all out, like straight hoes to dykes\nSwitchin the game around like Reeboks from Nikes\nStayin in my black dickies, t-shirts all white\nThugged out, what it's all about, all right\nLet's just shoot it out now, we can do it all night\nIt don't matter, the 50 caliber gon' bite\nWatch 'em scatter, the loud sound got 'em all fright\nGet the cheddar, then let them cowards hear the dual pipes\nWhen we bite, we fight like pits on red meat\nIs this life the shit nigga? Yes it fuckin be\nFreaks take a glimpse, they scream Buck's the shit\nNow fiend for the dick, as I lean in the 6\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three]\nBack in my 'llac the auto fo'-fo's and Optimos\nKickin in do's on the one stressin {?}\nLet me get that out you hoes, me and my snub nose\nBonnie and Clyde, when we ride, both of us have open eyes\nRealized I'm a young nigga, puttin it fuckin down\nNever goin to sleep without a hundred fuckin miles\nLayin it down, my name is known throughout town\nBlaka blaka, blaka blaka\n\n[Hook]", "album": "T.I.P.", "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/d018174ecb7b887477659509ddf44ca3.499x499x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young Buck"}
