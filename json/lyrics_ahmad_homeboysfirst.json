{"songs": [{"title": "Homeboys First", "lyrics": "[Verse One]\nKick it, well I'm up first\nAnother first for my bros and my niggaros\nAnd I'm makin' noise for homeboys\nLike back when I was little\nHad a normal route\nUsed to knock on the door, yell, \"Can Damien come out?\"\nThat's the homie that's been there\nEver since I can remember\nTight, we used to ball from the pole to the street light\nFight a little, make up, then break up quickly\nAnd eight minutes later\nWe get caught stealin' out of Thriftys\nBut I had his back and he had mine\nYou deserve to do the time if you're doin' the crime\nBut we didn't see it that way so we break north\nThrough the double doors\nCouldn't get into trouble cause moms was on the lookout\nSo we was on the Diamondback, bookin'\nMy boy and his bike\nHad to be in before the streetlights\nGet home fast\nSit on the steps, reminisce and laugh\nAbout that day and all the joy with my homeboy\n\n[Chorus]\nSo who comes first?\nThe homeboys come first\nTell me who comes first?\nThe homeboys come first\nYell it who comes first?\nThe homeboys come first\nAnd make some noise\nIf you're down for your homeboys\nOhhh\nSo who comes first?\nThe homeboys come first\nTell me who comes first?\nThe homeboys come first\nYell it who comes first?\nThe homeboys come first\nCause even when you feel low\nYou still got your niggaro\n\n[Verse Two]\nWell it's the niggaro\nBack to hit the game\nWin a baller with a two hand tap\nAgainst the glass, then I kick ass\nHomeboys first upon my list\nSo a chick can miss me actin' lonely\nNo hoe before the homie\nEver since I was a kid I used to wish I was grown up\nI would have a child, have a wife and live the good life\nStrife got in the middle\nIt's a little bad\nLearned that girls were only out to get what niggas have\nSo down smashes my hopes\nThat I might rope a woman that can do no wrong\nIf I could sing then I'd write a song like\nWhoa are the troubles of a worrisome man\nIt's easy to make a baby\nBut it's hard to find a good lady\nBut I'm cool though\nI've still got my niggaros\n?\nSo I guess I'm doin' okay\nAnd one day\nI may be at a club and find a woman that's the real mccoy\nBut for now I got my homeboys\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three]\nWell this is one last verse\nTellin' you to put your niggas first\nAt the top of the pole\nThen give it up if you got soul\nAnd to those of you who get rich quick\nAnd struggled where the homies live at\nSo don't forget to give back\nDon't know much\nBut I'll tell you what I do know clown\nQuick as you come up is as quick as you can go down\nFriends have your back till the end\nOr for better or worse\nSo it pays to always put your homeboys first\n\n[Chorus]", "year": null, "album": "Ahmad", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3d85c954b2ab0c9abe8f9fc12381fbd7.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ahmad"}
