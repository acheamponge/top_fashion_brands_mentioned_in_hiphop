Just leave a message\n\n[Pissed off girlfriend]\nHi sweetie. It's me. Remember? Your girlfriend?\nYou know the one that you fuck from time to time\nI call you, I e-mail you, I page you and yet, no phone call back\nWhy is it that I don't get a phone call?\nLet's think. That god damn music of yours that's why\nThat comes first, not me\nI know we've had this argument time and time again\nBut for some odd reason, over the past, how many years have we been together?\nMusic still comes first to you. Where do I fit in? When am I ever gonna fit in?\n\n[Hook] [Truth Enola] (De La Soul)\nLove\n(Dealin' with the drama in your...)\nLife\n(Pressure from your queen)\nYou're holdin' me too...\nLeave\n(You can leave now)\nBe all right\nLove\n(Dealin' with the drama in your...)\nLife\n(Pressure from your queen)\nYou're holdin' me...\nFollow my lead\nBe all right\n\n[Verse One] [Truth Enola]\nDrama queen, givin' a man\nBest of the sex\nWorst of the stress\nHalf of the love\nHalf the respect\nOverstand your emotional moods\nIt's a blank\nWhen it comes to my technical ways, gettin' bank\nFirst message on my cell, \"Daddy please come home.\"\nSecond message, \"Daddy please, I don't wanna be alone.\"\nThird message, \"I know you fuckin' them bitches out there.\"\nForth message, \"When you get home, I won't be there.\"\nLady, givin' me drama, more than my soul can accommodate\nWatch your shit miss, I need some time away\nA little liquor I'm\nA little drunk I'm\nGonna wash away the way you front\nWhen you know I spend a lot right (Right)\nHit the spot right (right)\nSplit your back right\nEven lick your cat right\nFuckin' with you\nSpectacular brain\nEnd of the game\nI'll probably be shackled and chained\nDrama queen\n\n[Hook] [Truth Enola]\nLove\nLife\nYou're holdin' me too tight\nAnd if you up and leave\nStill gonna be alright\nLove\nLife\nYou're holdin' me too tight\nAnd if you up and leave\nStill gonna be alright\n\n[Verse Two] [Trugoy]\nYou made me hit you once and kick you out four times\nAnd you're still in my two way lookin' for a lemon\nStay givin' me hell when all I want is peace, pussy and progress\nTo make our little shack/Shaq Shaquille\nI hustle state to state, smugglin' two inches into studios\nJust to cut the dope deal\nYou stand on my moods when you got your heels\nDead center on my back\nBitch get off me\nYou wanna 9 to 5 mono-typical Joe\nWell I'm a 12 to 12 stereo, extra ordinary\nYou stay with your hands in my face which makes it very\nDifficult not to reflex (reflex)\nPicture me on The Source cover\nIke Turner smile big headline \"Peaceful rapper goes wiiiild\"\nWe at it again, it ain't gon' end\nMy niggas whisperin', \"It must be the sex.\"\nShe's my drama queen\n\n[Hook] [Truth Enola]\nLove\nLife\nYou're holdin' me too tight\nAnd if you up and leave\nStill gonna be alright\nLove\nLife\nYou're holdin' me too tight\nAnd if you up and leave\nStill gonna be alright\n\n[Scratches]\n\"Gotta change the way it's goin' down\" - De La Soul 'Itzoweezee'\n\n[Hook] [Truth Enola] (De la Soul) [x2]\nLove (dealin' with the drama in your...)\nLife (pressure from your queen)\nYou're holdin' me too tight\nAnd if you up and leave\nStill gonna be alright\nLove\nLife\nYou're holdin' me too tight\nAnd if you up and leave\nStill gonna be alright\n\n[Outro] [Girlfriend talking]\nYou know what? You're probably there right now\nYou just got those god damn headphones on you can't hear me\nI'm tired of this. I'm tellin' you this\nI'm really fuckin' tired of it.
