They hate my guts too\nI hate it has to come to me taking from you\nSorry guy, but I feel you've insulted me\nJust for leaving something in front of me\nHonor amongst us? Bitch, stop it\nMan, I'm tryna pick pocket the man who's pick pocketin'\nAnd for the ladies, I have a magic trick, listen here\nPut your purse in my hand, watch it magically disappear\n\n[Hook: King Gordy]\n\n[Verse 2: King Gordy]\nWhat's on today's agenda? I can't remember\nOh yeah, take a swisher, put haze all in it, then blaze and hit it\nOkay, I'm back on track now\nI drifted away for a minute, came back down\nI'm mental, my brain starts itching from these rap styles\nDid I mention I'm insane lyrics that wow\nA thieve who feels stronger 'bout robbing\nPlease pardon me while I steal your belongings\nFrom kitchen utensils to kids bicycles\nFrom pennies to nickles I will try to hit you they say\nNothing is worser than a thief\nThou shalt not steal is what many people believe\nBut I shall not live without anything to eat\nIll steal a hot meal, candied yams, greens, and meat\nAnd a big cup of Kool-Aid to drink\nSee I'm a broke MC, I don't get paid to think\n\n[Hook: King Gordy]\n\n[Verse 3: King Gordy]\nTo those I offend, I'm really not sorry for it\nOh you stole before, see, you just call it borrowing'\nNo matter how you look at it, it seems to me\nYou've been charged for a crime I like to call thievery\nYou're in denial, but I'm sure it'll pass\nNow you go now with your big bad stealin' ass\nIt ain't wrong man, you needed that shirt, you needed them pants\nBaby girl you need that skirt, you need that cash\nYou stole from your baby daddy's secret stash\nGirl you lookin' good, so what if he beats your ass\nSometimes you just have to take the good with the bad\nIf you took it, then you crooked, better hope that it lasts\nIf this becomes a hit, man I'll be so glad\nCause I actually turned hittin' a lick into a fad\nAnd I'll have fans that scream to me with feelin'\n(Hey, thats the guy who made a whole song about stealin'\nI love you!)"}]}
