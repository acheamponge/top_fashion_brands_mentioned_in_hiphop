I let 'em know\n\n[Hook 1]\nI let 'em know\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow, one an' one is two and two an' two make four\nMy name is Young, I rock the house, we're talkin' rhymes galore\nIt doesn't matter who you are, or who you want to be\nYou'll never ever rock as nasty as the Young MC\nSo now darlin', darlin' come and see my show\nYou want a ticket then I get you one in the front row\nAnd you can bring a friend, yes a girl perhaps\nAnd when the show is over, come sit on my lap\nBecause you can't resist me, neither can your friend\nIt starts in the beginnin' finishes up at the end\nAnd all these others come around and swear they're better than me\nWhen they can't even deal with the Young MC\nI mean they think they in command, but they're out of control\nThey think that they're out of jail, they're only on parole\nThey think they're walkin' on water when they're on a jet ski\nThey think they hot on the mic, they ain't as hot as me\nThey think they flyin' through the air, when they on a plane\nThey think they have a sound mind, when they goin' insane\nThey think they lyin' on the beach, when there ain't no sand\nThey think that they the freshest rapper, they ain't heard the man\nSo let me tell you party people this is how it goes\nI am the one you listen to, cause I'm the one you chose\nAnd if you think they competition, they can deal with me\nHere is my number, call the house, the name is Young MC\nI let 'em know\n\n[Hook 2]\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nI let 'em know\nBreak it down\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey said a boy is a boy and a girl is a girl\nAnd Young MC, he is a rapper ready to rock world\nI am a man with a skill, of a duty to fulfill\nOf party goers every which without the need to get ill\nNo need to scream and to shout, cause that's not what I'm about\nCause I'm a man who's rockin' the jams, to this there is no doubt\nContinuing with my tale, to never flop or to fail\nBe good to you just like a discount at a one day sale\nI'm not a criminal or hood, neither the riff or raff\nIf every rapper was a comic, I'd be makin' you laugh\nIf every rapper was a worker, I'd be chief of the staff\nAnd on a scale of one to ten, I am a ten and a half\nIf every rapper was a lion, I'd be king of the beast\nIf every rapper was a cop, I'd be chief of police\nIf every rapper was a soldier, I would be Rambo\nIf every rapper was Hawaiian, I would be Don Ho\nYou're a fish who's out of water, I'm a great white shark\nI'm a healthy burst of lightin', you're a shot in the dark\nI'm a law abidin' citizen, you're breakin' the laws\nAnd I'm a man who's almost perfect, you're filled with flaws\nThis is not exaggeration, this is straight up truth\nRap is to me what good sex is to Dr. Ruth\nRap is just like sex cause I'm aimin' to please\nBut when you're listenin' to my rhyme, you'll never catch a disease\nNow like a man once said, when you're slow ya blow\nTo prevent against this I'm always good to go\nNever ever frontin' moves, I'm makin' sure of stuff\nAnd when the mic is in my hand, that's when the stuff get rough\nCause I'm a man who's on a mission and I'm not done yet\nCause this is rougher then the roughest of the rough stuff yet\nI make noise like a smoke detector when there's smoke\nAnd I'm good to go, so now you know the Young MC's no joke\nI let em know\n\n[Hook 3]\nWord em up, I let em know\nThere it is", "album": "Stone Cold Rhymin\u2019", "year": "1989-09-05", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7e9ff08751b8e32d468ac9e4127b8bec.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young MC"}
