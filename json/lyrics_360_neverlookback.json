I'd rather ride a tram\nWith my headphones on, I'm daydreamin'\nTo pave the way, take it to slate 'cause it ain't even\nI stay breathin', awake to the inner city\nWalk a different path to plan like I was sippin' whiskey\nGo to Vanilla Bay to say \u201chey\u201d\nDown paninis when I'm takin' the paper the same day\nI'm a loud mouth, I fiend for the loud crowd\nRock a show hard then lounge down at the town house\nAnd when it's time to wake, I bounce out\nAs I fiend for the people to love me and bow down\nAs I fiend for the people to love me and bow down\nGive us a proud crowd and say that it's ours now (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\nI can see all this life just happenin'\nAnd I can see all this stuff just happenin'\nAnd I can see all this rap just happenin'\nAnd when it does, yo, I won't look back again\nAnd I can see all this life just happenin'\nAnd I can see all this stuff just happenin'\nAnd I can see all this rap just happenin'\nAnd when it does, yo, I won't look back again\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd when I left the scene, it felt like some fresh air\nTo not walk around a bunch of nutters giving death stares\nIs this kid really serious? Yeah, maybe\nWhat? You don't think he is because his hair's crazy?\nHe loves to run around, representin' Forthwrite\n'Cause he knows they're bringin' the noise like an exhaust pipe\nOnly money made is Centrelink on fortnights\nBattered with bad vision, the opposite of hawks' eyes\nBut then he saw his mask, it left him torn apart\nBorn to ask questions about this [shit] we callin' art\nIt's sort of hard, we're out livin' a confused life\nHe'll talk his heart then they're givin' him a bruised eye\nIf you're the type to see or believe sin\nThe only way to talk, you need to be preachin'\nDon't follow when you don't believe what they're teachin'\nAnd speak out, bring the freedom of speech in\nYeah, speak out, bring the freedom of speech in\nYeah, speak out, bring the freedom of speech in\nMCs just make sure you speak out\nPeace out, I gotta just leave now, uh (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\nI can see all this life just happenin'\nAnd I can see all this stuff just happenin'\nAnd I can see all this rap just happenin'\nAnd when it does, yo, I won't look back again\nAnd I can see all this life just happenin'\nAnd I can see all this stuff just happenin'\nAnd I can see all this rap just happenin'\nAnd when it does, yo, I won't look back again\n\n[Outro]\nHa ha ha, yeah\nYou know you like it\nSignin' out"}]}
