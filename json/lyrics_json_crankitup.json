Maybe He ain't fly enough\nActing all scared, homie, maybe He ain't die enough\nWell to me what He did on the cross made me find my joy in Him and count everything as lost\nSo crank it up\n\nChorus [Derek Minor]\nThey say your light ain't bright enough\nGon' 'head and crank it up (X3)\nThey say your life ain't hype enough\nGon' 'head and crank it up (X3)\nGon' 'head and crank it up (X4)\nYour light ain't bright enough?\nYour life ain't hype enough?\nThis what you should do, bruh\nGone head & crank it up\n\nVerse 2 [JSon]\nLook I'm a frame derty\nLife's through the blood pusher\nChrist turned up\nI'm just a subwoofer\nHe is the light, and it ain't right if He ain't beamin' through ya\nChrist the glassmaker - they should see Him through ya\nSo gone get it on, rep His throne in your city though\nMake His glory known off the dome like a Philly flow\nZone in a way your face ain't shown like a fitty low\nHome ain't here really though\nSo long for were you finna go\nHomes what you chillin fo'?\nLift the living bread up\nChrist got His heal bruised\nSatan got his head crushed\nSin got it's head bust\nBombs over Baghdad\nHefty Hefty cinch sak, the grave's in a trashbag\nSo L-O-L, homie,  show 'em what your Faith's about\nThe good news is the mail and the world is your paper route\nYou know what the race about\nNever let them snap your wire\nCause they won't hear your life unless Christ is your amplifier\n\nChorus [Derek Minor]\nThey say your light ain't bright enough\nGon' 'head and crank it up (X3)\nThey say your life ain't hype enough\nGon' 'head and crank it up (X3)\nGon' 'head and crank it up (X4)\nYour light ain't bright enough?\nYour life ain't hype enough?\nThis what you should do, bruh\nGone head & crank it up\n\nVerse 3 [JSon]\nSo where's your volume set? I'm trying to raise mine\nFrontlyner style fam, they need to hear the bassline\nHe erased mine\nI was so sick\nHad to be broken just to shine, I'm a glow stick\nThe goals to go get\nThose who hopeless\nShow 'em that He rose, and the globe's His focus\nSo just be bold cause you know who your hopes in\nNo don't fold you should know why the flows spit\nStay focused that's our life's battle\nYou'll reach the whole world - know how fast light travel?\nSo let your life speak, they'll hear you beating downtown\nAll turned up, the world'll hear us - surround sound\nSo gone and crank it up\nCause some is hard to see\nLet your light shine, and watch the darkness flee\nWorld calling but His word charging me\nSo I'ma stand out, stand out like He's callin' me\n\nChorus [Derek Minor]\nThey say your light ain't bright enough\nGon' 'head and crank it up (X3)\nThey say your life ain't hype enough\nGon' 'head and crank it up (X3)\nGon' 'head and crank it up (X4)\nYour light ain't bright enough?\nYour life ain't hype enough?\nThis what you should do, bruh\nGone head & crank it up"}], "artist": "Json"}
