Hehe.  In this corner, same cats that [?].  (Weighing out of the first...).  This is not, important, man.  [?].  All of you do know very well who I am.  Now...\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nIt\u2019s been a long time.  I shouldn\u2019t have left you\nBut I was babysitting my nieces and nephews (Oh)\nLabels\u2019ll pay you two cent for them hood rhymes\nLast time I wanted a Penny, I was watching Good Times\nYou ain\u2019t popping.  If so, we soon to see, liar\nFlame off the top.  I pour water on your Kundalini fire\nIn my spare time, what I write\u2019ll make you fear mines\nEach rhyme sharp like parts of Grand Puba\u2019s hairline\nI\u2019m a soloist\u2014I hurt teams most\nAnd get the whole house shook like Thirteen Ghosts\nNo, fuck that!  I\u2019m tired of this buck-rap.  Hip hop slug\nThugs knocked the fuck out\u2014fuck ya love tap\nThis is the round trip ticket\u2014you\u2019ll catch a bus back\nI train where I conduct jacks, so don\u2019t get stuck, black\nActing like it can\u2019t happen, you\u2019ll owe me a plaque\nLike the Lakers ain\u2019t still got Kobe and Shaq\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nThey call me C-Rayz Walz.  Clashing, mashing, splashing\n(Is he nice?)  Man, who you asking?\nC-Rayz Walz.  Spilling it, killing it\nYou feeling it?  Any show I get, I\u2019m stealing it\nC-Rayz Walz.  Hip hop.  Rip shot\nGet rocked.  Let \u2018em know that I came to rock\nC-Rayz Walz.  And I shined before I signed a deal\nAnd you know I\u2019m real\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nThe reason my form is complete and sick\nMy style was born spored on a Petri dish\nIn a room with microchips, blips, and math quotes\nAlien graffiti on my lab coat!\nBut now I spit hard, rip these bars and simply sell\n\u2018Til I hit rock bottom like an empty well\nThis is for the love, but I do profit\nWhile y\u2019all cats is sooner to get Junior than Lou Gossett\nWhen I blacked out like dark-skinned brothers\u2014those you kill (No!  No!)\nI see the price of paper\u2014it\u2019s poems for sale\nIf you too shook to get busy\nI\u2019ll punch you in the stomach, make the butterfly dizzy\nTelepathy\u2019ll make your clique about faith\nTryna play me like the monkey in Outbreak\nThis A&R try to tell me who I should rhyme like\n[?].  His shell toes have five stripes\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nThey call me C-Rayz Walz.  Clashing, mashing, splashing\n(Is he nice?)  Man, who you asking?\nC-Rayz Walz.  Spilling it, killing it\nFeeling it?  Any show I get, I\u2019m stealing it\nI'm C-Rayz Walz.  Hip hop.  Rip shot\nGet rocked.  Let \u2018em know that I came to rock\nC-Rayz Walz.  And I shined before I signed a deal\nAnd you know I\u2019m real\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nStand up, hands up, touch ceilings\nHeadphones in your ribs\u2014listen to your gut feelings\nRevealing questions.  Do you have answers?\nNo.  You\u2019re Dorothy.  I\u2019m the hurricane in Kansas\nI\u2019m blessed.  Don\u2019t make me put the speakers to your chest (Boom, boom)\nForce you into cardiac arrest\nTurn clubs to paper, leave stages ripped up\nAlbums are special ed kids\u2014they gotta be picked up\nMy shadow superior (So?).  I scheme on crews\nWith enough skills to make the village voice scream on you\nViolate your rights.  Then the bragging ends\nPut two in you bitch niggas like you having twins\nI don\u2019t care what you seen or heard.  In fact\nI\u2019m C-Rayz Walz, off the bean curd rack\nAnd you wack acts is lame.  It\u2019s a shame\u2014admit it\nI could write a whole album off the brain in five minutes\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nThey call me C-Rayz Walz.  Clashing, mashing, splashing\n(Is he nice?)  Man, who you asking?\nI'm C-Rayz Walz.  Spilling it, killing it\nYou feeling it?  Any show I get, I\u2019m stealing in it\nI'm C-Rayz Walz.  Spit hard, rip bars\nGood God.  Let \u2018em know that I\u2019m on my job\nI'm C-Rayz Walz.  And I shined before I signed a deal\nAnd you know I\u2019m real"}]}
