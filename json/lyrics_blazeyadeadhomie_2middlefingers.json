The Casket Factory...\n\n[Verse 1: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]\nLet me give these bitches a chair\nYou know they can't stand to see me doing good\nReppin' my hood from sundown to sunup\nOn the come up, so shut up and let me get a grip\nI ain't constipated like bitches who ain't shit\nI ain't sedated, medicated, vacationing on a trip\nI'm in their ears like a Q-Tip, Miss me with that lip\nStill they busted and they split, in need of some chap stick\nAnd all I got is some fat dick\nSo suck it or fuck it or shut the fuck up and fuck off\nI'm like Cialis, see I stay hard while y'all weak bitches who stay soft\nLike a pillow. I'm incognito like silhouettes\nI'm impatient like a killer get, like it or love it I'm killing it\n\n[Hook: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]\nPut 2Middle Fingers in the sky fo' me\n(Time to welcome home Ya Dead Homie)\nWho ready to ride or die fo' me?\n(Time to welcome home Ya Dead Homie)\n\n[Verse 2: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]\nI channel the spirit of 2Pac and Biggie within me\nGod give me the will to never be anything but me\nI spit it correct and never let the weak shit infect me\nSee I'm a prodigy intense, sometimes I gotta be...\nS-Sometimes I gotta be aggressive\nI grew up in a home that was oppressive\nSo I go the extra mile to be impressive\nI'm insane and I'll kill you all the same\nI'm not an angel with wings like an arrow point\nI'm more like a helicopter, you get chopped up in the blades\nI'm Blaze, the hardest killer in the game\nAnd I don't need a fucking clock or a chain to bang\nI'm from the home of \"Nobody gives a fuck who you is\"\nAnd if you feeling me in this bitch then all you gotta do is:\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]\n\nWent from a:\nBoy to a man, I'm a thug til I kick the can, I mean the bucket, don't got a bucket-list, I got a fuck-it-list\nI'm first on the list to say fuck it bitch, see I'm correct an shit\nNot the solution I'm the problem and yeah I'm loving it\nI'm above it, like the clouds when you down\nWe on ya better seek shelter or get your umbrella\nBecause I got a knack for wetting em up\nMy knife ready to stab and cut\nMy motto is six short words \"bitch I don't give a fuck\"\n\n[Hook]\n\n\"The Resurrection will not be televised.. You can look to the skies, and realize.. The dead man.. has returned!\""}], "artist": "Blaze Ya Dead Homie"}
