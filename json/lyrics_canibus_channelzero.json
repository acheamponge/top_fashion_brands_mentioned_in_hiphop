This group's primary objective was to desensitize us to the truth, and to suppress the material evidence that our planet is being visited by a group of extraterrestrial biological entities called The Grays\n\n[Chorus]\nTune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero\nTune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero\nTune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero\nTune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero\n\n[Verse 1]\nYo, sometimes the road to the truth is so elusive, it's confusin'\nAnd reality becomes illusion\nIf I showed the masses where we was at or where we was goin'\nI'd shatter the social balance of the world as we know it\nI'm talkin' 'bout the grand deception of 1947\nWhen our souls were sold to the heavens\nFor technologically advanced weapons\nCrystal enhanced, brain implants, and mind control methods\nMJ-12 is not majestic\nAnd the focal point of our problems on this planet are not domestic\nYou can accept it, or be stupid and be a skeptic\nAnd fail to recognize the secret society's death wish\nNinety-seven percent of our Presidents were Masons\nResponsible for launderin' trillions of dollars from the nation\nFor the construction of underground military installations\nAbductions and cattle mutilations\nExperiments on human patients\nCan take place in several subterranean bases\nA hundred and fifty storeys below a basement\nWith knowledge of genetic information, you need to fear science not Satan\n'Cause through the manipulation of certain biological agents\nThey create strange creations\nTop secret special operations\nLow frequency sounds and lasers, people like Carl Sagan\nThat didn't believe in the Drake equation\nWere tryin' to keep Western civilization on the need-to-know basis\nWell, you need to know that this is a game\nAnd we're bein' betrayed and played in the worst way\n\n[Chorus]\nTune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero\nTune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero\nTune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero\nTune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, the Holy Script from Genesis 1:26 says\n\"Let us make man in our image under our likeness\"\nFirst of all who's \"they?\"\nYou see if God was truly a single entity, that's not what He would say\nWe as the Elohim, Gods and Goddesses\nPossess a marvelously monstrous subconscious\nLifeforms that speak, in very high pitched sounds and squeaks\nShort staccato clicks and beeps\nA highly advanced form of speech\nEven though to us, it seems like they only chatterin' they teeth\nThey used to swim deep in the oceans beneath\n'Til they fins transformed into limbs and they started to creep\nThen they evolved into mammals with feet\nAnd walked right from the shorelines onto the beach\nThey used gravity, 'cause it's actually the only force around\nThat could slow time and the speed of light down\nThe energy grid network opened the gateway from Earth\nTo any point in the universe\nLivin organisms and various geomagnetic gravitational anomaly areas\nSpace expedition teams in the lunar regions\nReported seein', decapyramids and tetrahedrons\nLiquid filled shoes, is what they used\nTo walk across the moon without leavin' a clue\nOf where they been for the past twenty-three billion years\nBefore life on the surface even appeared\nI hope you become aware what I'm spittin' in your ear\nWas intended to stimulate your left brain's hemisphere\nI know it sounds weird, all these motherfuckin' answers\nAnd questions to the grand deception\n\n[Chorus]\nTune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero\nTune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero\nTune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero\nTune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero\nTune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero\nTune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero\nTune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero\nTune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero"}]}
