Do you love me for real?\nDo you love me for real? Do you love me for real?\n(Said my car as I worked her wheel)\nDo you love me for real? Do you love me for real?\nDo you love me for real? Do you love me for real?\n(Said my car as I worked her wheel)\n\n[Verse 1: Big KRIT]\nOn the boulevard, oh my Lord\nHer heels so high, she skipped the curb and ran in your yard\nShe's so, super fly\nCrushed linen inside\nThis shit way too old, for me to drive\nBut I really don't care at all\nShe let me white her walls, and uh, pop her trunk\nTurn her out, give her thump\nCause she need it\nAnd she want it\nThere's no denying how I feel\nCause this love feels so real\n\n[Hook: Mara Hruby]\n\n[Verse 2: Big KRIT]\nOh the boulevard, she go hard\nNo matter where and when, if I push her buttons she start\nSo, out of sight\nShawty cold as ice\nAin't no shame in her game, you just ain't her type\nThat ain't no lie at all\nShe creep and crawl\nAnd without a stall or a pause, I break her off\nCause she need it and she want it\nTheres no denying how I feel\nCause this love feels so real\n\n[Hook: Mara Hruby]\n\n[Verse 3: Big KRIT]\nNever ever have I ever seen a girl like you before\nI love to hug onto your curves don't ever let me go\nHold on tight, I'll run the light, the peddle to the floor\nAnd take us higher than we've ever been\n(A place where no one goes)\nLets go\n(A place where no one knows)\nLets go\n\n[Hook: Mara Hruby]"}], "artist": "Big K.R.I.T."}
