What are we supposed to do when the storm's us? Where are we supposed to run to? What can I say? I don't even know who I'm talking to, looking in the mirror I see unfamiliar shadows, looking in the galaxy I feel so shallow, my heart, like a black hole, wicked and deceitful, trying to do good, surrounded by evil\nThis time I will get it right, now's the time for me to step into the light\n(repeat)\nThe light is so beautiful, I close my eyes\nI've been burned before, it happened many times\nI can be my own worst enemy or I can blame You for tempting me, I got good and bad tendencies, tenacious and habitual, with bad habits and rituals, worthy of ridicule, I got no excuses, I'm pitiful, I get stressed over miniscule little nothings, just a drop in the bucket, I see a way out but I'm so reluctant, it's time to swallow my pride, it's time to get my life right\n\nAll these thoughts, they drive me crazy\nSome of them are now escaping\nThere's a spider in my head\nAnd I'm afraid to go to bed\nI'm a mad man and I've lost it\nWon't You please help me find it?\nCause I need You so bad\nOh yes I need You so bad, You're so good\nYour mercy is so good\nYour blood, it covers me\nIt sounds a little dark\nI'm walking in the light", "year": null, "album": "The IV Edition"}], "artist": "Braille"}
