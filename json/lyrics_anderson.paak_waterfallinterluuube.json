Ooh, it's yours\nI don't know if I'm the one you want to stay with\nBut I know that I'm the only one who makes you cum\n\n[Hook]\nAnd as soon as I break down the wall\nI'm riding the wave of your waterfall\nAs soon as I break down the wall\nI'm riding the wave of your waterfall\nAs soon as I break down the wall\nI'm riding the wave of your waterfall\n\n[Outro]\nOoh, don't touch me baby\nDon't touch me baby\nWait, I'm okay, I'm alright\nGive me space, don't touch me baby"}]}
