{"songs": [{"title": "Hood Antics", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYeah, I'm stiff when I skank\nI'm cranked in the rave with a whiff and a shank\nAnd I swear to God, my mum would go mad\nIf she ever knew how much they'd left that rack\nI call my grub that elastic pack\nCuh I grab the food, then I stretch that back\nPut notes in the stack till it goes snap\nHit sales on my bike till the wheel's flat\nI burn plastic bags till they go black\nWeigh peng on the scales till they go flat\nSpray bars at a crowd till they go mad\nMake chicks' eyes squint till they roll back\nSkrrr in the ding dong till I get catch\nDrop game on the yats till I get gash\nAnd I've been the same since Dad had a say\nSo fam, I would backchat till I got lashed\n\n[Hook]\nPlease don't act up, please don't play\nToo many antics, too many games\nSo many borers, so many flames\nToo many tracksuits, too many chains\nSo many baby mums and young dads\nToo many crazy dons who back shanks\nRun from the studio to go trap\nHood antics, we're out for that cash\n\n[Verse 2]\nO-O-O-OK\nGet garms to my yard and I don't pay\nSleep in a hotel and I don't pay\nXOYO and I don't pay\nGet love in the dance but I don't say\nOnstage at a show but I don't spray\nMan can't try a ting cause I don't play\nKnown in the rave scene but I don't rave\nGot packs of the green but I don't\nSaid got packs of the green but I don't blaze\nWake up midday but I don't laze\nEat food on the field but I don't graze\nBristol Motion on tour with the lads\nI sprayed \"missed the drop\" and the crowd went mad\nAll the hard work in the scene for my mum\nI beat off the gram, then my mum gets sad\n\n[Hook]\nPlease don't act up, please don't play\nToo many antics, too many games\nSo many borers, so many flames\nToo many tracksuits, too many chains\nSo many baby mums and young dads\nToo many crazy dons who back shanks\nRun from the studio to go trap\nHood antics, we're out for that cash\n\n[Verse 3]\nWest 10, I'm a Grove side G\nI had to grow fast cause of roadside beef\nGot handed a tool and I got Ps\nGot touched in the warfare and I did bleed\nIf I ain't down in Brixton with my family\nI'm in Camden with the YGGs\nS-d-daint, Strally and PK are my dons\nYou could never violate my GGs\nTry and violate my GGs\nI'll jump out the cab with a live 33\nSawn off on the IC3\nWe're cold, you'll get burnt by my icy Gs\nMy Air Max save me when the cops come\nSo I've gotta thank Nike like North does\nWhat's a best friend? Cause I ain't got one\nBut I got a friend who's close to the shotgun\n\n[Hook]\nPlease don't act up, please don't play\nToo many antics, too many games\nSo many borers, so many flames\nToo many tracksuits, too many chains\nSo many baby mums and young dads\nToo many crazy dons who back shanks\nRun from the studio to go trap\nHood antics, we're out for that cash", "year": "2015-06-12", "album": "The Front", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f0eb83568b2186131c044e95901cf98a.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "AJ Tracey"}
