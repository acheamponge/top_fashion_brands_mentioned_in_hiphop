Blige\nAs I listen to her life go down watching her life spin round\nOn them records every track she singin prayer\nGive her \"No More Drama\" let her \"Rainy Days\" be clear\nReceiving signs from Osama that the days is near\nWhen babies is baby mommas, man them days is here\nAnd beings that them days is now\nI pray that Allah have mercy when my day come round\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Sung w/ ad libs]\nWe need your mercy, I need your mercy\nFor my soul, for my soul\n\n[All together]\nB-I-G, P-O, P-P-A\nP-A-C, Left Eye, JMJ...\nB-I-G, L, P-U-N\nEazy-E, Aaliyah, R.I.P\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/48c4319dfc3c978405c6c446d03d8171.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2005-03-29", "title": "Lord Have Mercy", "album": "The B.
