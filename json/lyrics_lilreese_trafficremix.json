This Chiraq, you get left as a tragic\nKicked your bitch to the curb, she was too dramatic\nAnd where I'm from that's 300, normal spelled backwards\n\n[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]\nGot some little niggas in the Chi-Town, they ain't 'bout to be talking\nSix-hundred horses in my town, cause I ain't 'bout to be walking\nSee I don't know what the game's about, but I ain't bout to be playing\nNigga keep my name up out your mouth, that's all the fuck that I'm saying\nI ain't never been no police, I ain't never did no cuffing\nNigga killing niggas in all your rhymes, ain't never did no busting\nCounting the money, took two days\nLittle niggas will do ya' for some new J's\nReal talk, and that's nothing\nGloves on and that oven\nSaid she don't get the good dick often, now she 'bout to be stalking\nGot her on that killer kill, and that's why the bitch coughing\nSee my targets flipping like Gabby, they be doing gymnastics\nNigga I ain't high and I ain't hard to find, if you look for me I'm in traffic\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Reese]\nLet a nigga go in on me? I can't imagine\nBut I'm out here in these streets, catch me in traffic\nMy niggas shoot for free, they'll let you have it\nMy niggas do for me, ain't no way around it\nBloodhound for that money, bitch I gotta have it\nGoing crazy, twenties, fifties, hundreds, bitch I'm cashing\nAnd I ain't really with the talk, bitch I'm money stacking\nAnd he ain't really 'bout that life cause he don't love that action\nAnd they don't come from where I come from, they weren't born a savage\nLate night shit, catch him in traffic\nI ain't really gotta talk, bitch catch me in traffic\nAnd you know I got it on me, so I'm never lackin'\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Twista]\nLights, camera, action nigga, but this ain't no motherfucking cinema\n'Finna send it up, dude not true, screws not loose\n2pac, Juice nigga, hit 'em up\nNiggas don't know how to argue\nKiller hard shit when you see the mob thick in the whip\nNow your car's hit, nigga loose lips\nTalking nonsense, feel the contents of a clip\nWhatever you wanna do we can take it there, niggas around me want action\nLike a rhythmatic, forty calibers and nine millimeters equal subtraction\nThey could pull up in the Jag' with the runner on the side\nLevel opposition with the creep-creep\nBeep beep, put 'em in a deep sleep\nSee the way Reese or Chief Keef make beef brief\nBeast teeth, I'm a motherfucking monster\nEating up anybody that's coming at Windy City grind\nWhat you know about them niggas pulling up on the side of your Mercedez in traffic hitting it 50 times?\nDon't get into it with 'em, they gon' let you have it\nYou might end up in a coffin, you can call him Casket\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Lil Reese]\nWe ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action\nHe not 'bout that life, man catch him in traffic"}], "artist": "Lil Reese"}
