conversations with my fucking self\nIn need of help I try to focus on my mental health\nIf I'm not in this game then I don't have time for procrastination\nScreaming motherfuck rest and relaxation\nI'm tired of waitin'\n\n[Hook]\nLord, I'm suicidal nigga can't you tell\nI cut my wrist and watch it drip while screaming fare thee well\nDon't touch my body let me burn in fire leave me still\nI grab a crucifix and say a prayer going straight to hell\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhy you got a motherfuckin problem with a nigga that would push you to the limit with the effort he was givin'\nDelivering sinning inside my context, perplexed, by an intelligent type of concept\nI navigate a conversation my topics they tend to vary, various complicated essential thought, document with a pencil\nTo put it off in a file record a record I write\nYou ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight\nEver bust a nigga's head with a black lead pipe\nWhen the blood starts to gush it's coming in out in a rush\nThat's a pretty vicious vision you're given\nI'm getting vivid depicting death in a sentence\nAligning with the consensus\nIf you ever pay attention\nYou'll probably think that I'm demented\nThe mental case who's dependent on many antidepressants, oppressing the present feelings I have as I'm confessing\nI'm looking at the prescription like a motherfuckin prison\nPresenting it effervescent\nAuthenticating my message\nThe method in which I use\nI pray it's never confused\nThe pages battered and bruised\nFrom the way my lyrics fuse\nGet a hold of my pain try to use it as a muse\nA tool to entertain in vain for the amused\nI'm a semi-automatic\nWith static I let em have it\nThe bullet flying sporadic\nThe shell will fall in the casket\nTo burn the flesh of a bastard\nFor preparation of rapture\nThe rigor mortis I'm writing\nIs rummaging through your arteries\nAutograph with an asterisk\nNotarize with authority\nAnd all my shit is different\nI'm giving written deformities\nFormulated the plan for avoidance of the conformity\nAnd I can put the cots in the corner of dormitories\nDeploring that negativity\nGiven in your fragility\nLyrically my ability\nShowing off my agility\nIndiscriminate killer who's never spitting it timidly\nReminisce with a riddle to rid you of any empathy\nEmpathizing your sympathy through the sound of a symphony, purifying the soul conflicted by my emission\nSadistic but realistic\nAnd not materialistic\nThis motherfucker was gifted with the talent of taking words\nNouns and adverbs and making it backflip\nLui Kang crane kick with a different type of twist\nThe protagonist ain't alive\nAnd the villian's tryna survive\nAs he salivates over bodies\nHe's severing with a hatchet\nAnd leave em down in his cellar\nThe definition of ratchet\nThat captured imagination with captivating dismorphia\nConsequence of the pain you contain inside of your orifice\nDo you want any more of this\nMortifying your pulse that palpitates with your goriness\nIntroduction to the maker\nI can show you what the glory is\nSpeak on the salvation\nI preach with a prime motive\nLet these motherfuckers know it\nAhhh\n\n[Hook]\nLord, I'm suicidal nigga can't you tell\nI cut my wrist and watch it drip while screaming fare thee well\nDon't touch my body let me burn in fire leave me still\nI grab a crucifix and say a prayer going straight to hell\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm nothing more than a nigga with attitude\nMC Ren, Yella, Dre, Easy and Cube\nI'm showing some gratitude\nTesting your aptitude\nLook at the game and I gain a conclusion\nIt's all an illusion\nThe water's diluted\nYou sippin that juice and your mind is polluted\nBy these convoluters and losers\nI'm taking that situation and I try to diffuse it\nMan fuck that\nI'm a ticking time bomb\nBut I heard they got the motherfuckin evidence\nThey must of found the body hidden in my residence\nIt wasn't for the money and the pocket full of precedence\nInstead I give a fact and make it evident\nThey found it with its ripped eyes out visor with a top hat\nBlood up on my rug so you know you gotta stop that\nClaws at the foot of alpacas motherfucker better block that\n\n[Sample]\nThat's $25,000 alpaca\nYou block that shit\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd what you thought that I was finished\nDiminished, replenish whatever you motherfuckers givin', reliving\nI made a tape about religion but that was prior to what you currently hearing\nServing the secret\nTo leave it to keep it\nTo feel that I need it\nBut never retreating\nThe rarer defeated\nYour mind is depleted\nI'm trying to find the frequency\nJuvenile my delinquency\nI do it for respect not fame\nIf you want me to be honest then don't wanna be sane\nI've been speaking with the voice that lives inside of my brain, contained to explain\nBut how do you maintain\nI need a divine deity\nLooking for my identity\nBut all I wanted was a piece of mind and sovereignty\nFind it up in the melody\nI created a remedy\nHoping it giving clemency\nFlow is moving that Hennessy\nAnd when I'm dead and gone I just pray that you remember me\nMy god!\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nI've been having conversations with my fucking self\nIn need of help I try to focus on my mental health\nIf I'm not in this game then I don't have time for procrastination\nScreaming motherfuck rest and relaxation\nI'm tired of waitin'"}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
