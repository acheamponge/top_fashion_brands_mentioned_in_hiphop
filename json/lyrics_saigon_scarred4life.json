Like he the only one that had one and shit.  You crazy-ass nigga.  Fuck him, nigga.  Fuck it.  Tell \u2018em \u2018bout it, then, nigga\nRough: Screw that.  Oh, you don\u2019t wanna talk to me?  Bring me here?  Now you just wanna leave?\n\n[Verse 1: Rough]\nCan\u2019t tell me\nA reason for leaving, no hug or nothing.  Just walking out\nOne finger silencing me, nothing to talk about\nNeglection, indirectly showed me how to be a man\n\u2018Til this day, gave me no reason to try and understand\nMore than likely, you\u2019re the cause of mommy\u2019s hatred for man\nLeaving me to choose between school and bubbling grams\nWhat kind of guidance was that?  Scarred me for life\nMa saying you love us, she denying the fact\nBefore I decided to rap, that\u2019s what stuck in my cap\nA kid\u2019s childhood is something they can never get back\nOut of anything in the world, this is all that I ask:\nDon\u2019t feed me to the wolves or throw me away\nHow could I make it in this world if you don\u2019t show me the way?\nWalking past me on the streets, having nothing to say\nToying with people\u2019s feelings a game you shouldn\u2019t play\nYou wants to hold it down without eventually running away.  I\u2019m like:\n\n[Hook: Rough] (x2)\nI thought you loved me.  Hurt me for nothing\nIt\u2019s like you slugged me, put me through pain and suffering\nSon without a dad, wife with no husband\nScarred for life with no intentions of trusting\n\n[Verse 2: Rough]\nAnd my generation was eighty percent born with addiction\nTwenty percent don\u2019t listen, ten pack and .40 spitting\nRemainding thirty is pitching.  Any way you put it or take it\nBest believe somebody tricked \u2018em\nGovernment send drugs to the hood as an invite to prison\nTurn around, lock one of us up like they made a difference\nWhen playgrounds and daycare centers, that\u2019s what we\u2019re missing\nAlong with employment availability, college tuition\nThat\u2019s why the majority of us blooding and cripping\nInstead of becoming Muslims, gods, Sunnis and Christians\nIn order to get the point across, my team put me in a\nPosition.  Who don\u2019t get it, shut up and listen\nAll we knew is: \u201cSoldiers, stand firm and play your position\u201d\nWant to live life to the fullest, three-quarters of us can\u2019t go the distance\nAm I lying?  Naw, I\u2019m just being true\nYou was never there for me, so I did what I had to do\nPut the weight on mommy\u2019s shoulders, but what I really wanted to ask you...\nPut the weight on mommy\u2019s shoulders, but what I really wanted to ask you:\n\n[Hook: Rough] (x2)\nI thought you loved me.  Hurt me for nothing\nIt\u2019s like you slugged me, put me through pain and suffering\nSon without a dad, wife with no husband\nScarred for life with no intentions of trusting\n\n[Verse 3: Rough]\nFamily, friends, and foes there to witness your last\nFamily and friends mourn while the foes bicker and laugh\nMa dukes still in your corner, though she know you was bad\nWin or lose, when it blew, you was all that she had\nPlayed two roles as a parent: the mom and the dad\nCan you imagine how her and problems must\u2019ve clashed?\nProbably be alive today if you wasn\u2019t so fast.  They say\n\u201cThe good die young and the bad die last\u201d\nWanna question which one of you.  I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy should I ask?\u201d\nPastor preached at your service like never before\nMom\u2019s crying, realizing she won\u2019t see you no more\nThis the first time I seen you since you reached for the door\nWho would think my help for you would put you six feet?\nWhat goes around comes around.  Yeah, that much is true\nYou was never there for me, so I did what I had to do\nPut the weight on my mommy\u2019s shoulders, but what I really wanted to ask you:\n\n[Hook: Rough] (x2)\nI thought you loved me.  Hurt me for nothing\nIt\u2019s like you slugged me, put me through pain and suffering\nSon without a dad, wife with no husband\nScarred for life with no intentions of trusting\n\n[Bridge: Rough]\nIf you was alive, I\u2019d still feel like, \u201cWhy would\nYou bother?\u201d  I got a mother, never had a father\nIf you was alive, I\u2019d still feel like, \u201cWhy should\nYou bother?\u201d  I got a mother, never had a father\nIf you was alive, I\u2019d still feel like, \u201cWhy should\nYou bother?\u201d  I got a mother, never had a father\n\n[Outro: Saigon]\nYeah, you start that sad shit, man.  Why?  You always did that sad shit, man.  I used to be sitting there and he looking at me, look at me in the face.  Now, I\u2019m looking at the nigga.  I\u2019m like, I\u2019m like, \u201cMan, get over that shit, man\u201d", "album": "Saigon A.K.A. Da Yardfather Vol. 2: On the Go Back"}], "artist": "Saigon"}
