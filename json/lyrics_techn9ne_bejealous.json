young boy trying to get my money on\nMaking music in KC\nBut Mitch Bade niggas want to hate Tecca Ninna\nAnd they won't stop fucking with me\nSo I'ma fuck with niggas\n\nNa na na na na you cannot fuck with\nThat nigga Tech N9ne coming with that rough shit\nThem niggas know that I deserve it when they heard it\nHave the nerve to say it's nothing niggas so I got to bust it\n\n[Hook]\n(Be jealous) this is dedicated to all y'all haters\n(Be jealous) I see you watching me when I walked in the club\n(Be jealous) this is dedicated to all mitch baders\n(Be Jealous) you motherfuckers ain't showing Tech Ninna no love\n\n[Verse 1]\nFuck motherfuckers, buck motherfuckers\nHere the pain come nigga wit' a bang, I'm a killa better duck motherfucker\nWhat you standing on, nada\nWhat you plan to bone, nada\nWhat you plan to own, nada\nYour shit done came and gone\nBlood, sweat and tears nigga, been about 15 years nigga\nAin't never been no fears nigga, all I hear is cheers nigga\nThat's why I be in the bathroom with the bitches at maniacs\nThat's why them hoes in the club with Tech giving blowjobs in the back\nHow many niggas really wanna bust skulls?\nHow many niggas wanna become a wuss?\nFuck with a nigga like Tech get a buzz\nRight through the head and the grave is dug\nMean mugs, niggas ain't never seen love\nSo they stream blood when I fiend bud for the green shrubs\nAnd mushrooms I bust rooms open accustomed\nTo float across the ocean with verbal motion the notion\nIs boasting I'm poking with jealous, motherfuckers embellish\nThe truth to say I ain't worthy for fame, 'iancs and relish\n\n[Hook]\n(Be jealous) when you see me on the TV screen wilding\n(Be jealous) when you see me in the magazine smiling\n(Be jealous) when they let me in the club for free niggas\n(Be jealous) 'cause I'm bumming with bitches around me\nHaha motherfucker haha\nHaha motherfucker haha\nHaha motherfucker haha\nHella lit, I'ma spit, I'ma kick that shit\n\n[Verse 2]\nNo more styling I'ma start wilding on niggas, growling on niggas\nAnd we smiling 'cause the villain album went 6000 on niggas\nIn Kansas City alone, leave Tech, Big Dog, Will, Mike and Nitty alone\nMidwest Side, Lejo, Melly Mel I love you but it's a pity you gone\nNiggas hating on mine 'cause they knowing I'ma do it big\nThat's why the Tecca Ninna never ever got a problem getting a gig\n'Cause I rip shit they like, I flip shit you may bite\nWhen I spit shit I get rich quick, I make heats from dark to daylight\nN9ne millimeter guns, gonna be the one making a million when I come\nNever gonna be the bomb, where I come from niggas better get some\nTried to be right to these niggas, tried to be nice to these niggas\nSo now it's time for N9ne Godzilla to make mice of these niggas\nYou envy me, 'cause your bitch play Tecca Ninna all day\nAnd you see me on MTV, kicking it with King Tech, my nigga Sway\nBroke niggas ain't friends to me\nYou niggas really want me to disperse\nAlright I'll leave but when I come back it's gonna be 20 g's a verse nigga\n\n[Hook]\n(Be jealous) when you see me on the TV screen wilding\n(Be jealous) when you see me in the magazine smiling\n(Be jealous) when they let me in the club for free niggas\n(Be jealous) 'cause I'm bumming with bitches around me\nHaha motherfucker haha\nHaha motherfucker haha\nHaha motherfucker haha\nHella lit, I'ma spit, I'ma kick that shit\n\n[Verse 3]\nNiggas better stop talking about me, I ain't did shit\nI don't rap against niggas stop trying to get me to rap, so y'all could make grip\nAgginy don't be speaking my name, I know I fucked up\nOn a personal tip but if you niggas talking 'bout me, better rap motherfuckers better duck\nIf any niggas over there on the inside\nInfiltrating on me and my rogues\nThem niggas don't give no fucks about how many Tech N9ne units sold\nAnd who ever you bitch niggas is, saying I'm peeking in Lejo's log\nLejo'll tell you I'm original, and by the way Lejo my dog\nAnd the jealous motherfuckers won't quit\nSaid The Calm Before the Storm ain't shit\nWe killed y'all in 96 97\nWhat about when the new shit hit\nAnd I heard niggas said was washed up\nSaid the Tech N9ne flow is sleep\nThat's probably why I got shit in the movies\nLike Thicker Than Water and In Too Deep\nTie you up and beat you down to a bloody pulp son\nGot my villains and me mad enough to bust one\nI'm the second coming but you don't know 'cause you dumb\nBefore I go I'll tell you jealous motherfuckers to suck one\n\n[Hook]\n(Be jealous) when you see me on the TV screen wilding\n(Be jealous) when you see me in the magazine smiling\n(Be jealous) when they let me in the club for free niggas\n(Be jealous) 'cause I'm bumming with bitches around me\nHaha motherfucker haha\nHaha motherfucker haha\nHaha motherfucker haha\nHella lit, I'ma spit, I'ma kick that shit"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
