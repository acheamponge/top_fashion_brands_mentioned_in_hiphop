The do or die\nThe one with the fewest lies and the truest ties\nThey try to compare us, but\nLike a job straight outta high school there's no you and I\nI taught you everything you know, now you got student pride\nAll factual, I call the house \"the embassy\"\nThe studio \"the chapel\", I hate to travel\nI just pulled up on Sol\u00e1na show, the girl's a natural\nI knew her way back when Hollywood was international\nYeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends\nWord to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz\nVery presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential\nI broke spirits that I never meant to\nMy body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine\nAnd sleep at the opposite times\nPromise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil\nOr gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil\nViolatin' the Treaty of Versailles\nChampagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I\nI refuse to comply with regulations\nI listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence\nLike Sanders on the Detroit Lions\nGet a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya\nMotor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license\nThey tell me \"don't worry, I got your money\" like Osirus\n(I'm the Osiris of this shit)\nDirty 30, workin' on me\nTired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry\nCatering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite\nShit is nice, but I prefer Madeo\nCalamari rings and tomato\nI got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo\nWakin' up at 6 PM like, \"Where does the day go?\"\nForecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables\n2010 was when I lost my halo\n2017 I lost a J. Lo\nA Rotterdam trip had me on front page though\nI had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes\nClosed off but I could never stay closed\nBillboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sure\u00f1os\nBlack excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie\nThat just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't\nNiggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy\nProtection that God gave me\nShit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies\nI gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages\nI've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers\nKnowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here\nCover my ears, my security government tier\nYeah, advance the venue so we know the exits\nCheck the guest list\nIf opps make an appearance at least it's expected\nTell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace\nI'll be in better company with my own reflection\nMirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace\nThe TV playin' Al Jazeera\nInshallah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer\nWhenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira\n\n[Outro]\nI love, I love\nI love, I love it\nBaby, I"}]}
