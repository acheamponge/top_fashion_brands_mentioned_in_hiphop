I\u2019d rather roll up in a Bimmer\nMy momma's like I don\u2019t need it\nIn my heart I agree, but could you picture me leaning?\u00a0\nIt\u2019s sort of bittersweet, stuck American dreaming\u00a0\nI\u2019m just trying to get a piece nigga\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Fashawn]\nSome of my homies slang, some of them fiends\nI look at what I became, kinda in between\nStuck, caught up in the game, living the street dream\nI'm just trying to balance it out like a triple beam\nKeep so much on my mind I might go and do a crime\nMotherfuckers telling me don't rely on your rhymes\nWhen the industry declining, niggas ain't getting signed\nI'm either one step ahead or one behind\nA couple thousand dollars is just not enough\nI come from the bottom so I gotta stunt\nPhone buzzing, oh damn, what everybody want?\nMy bad, niggas ain't seen me in about a month\nI've been hustling, trying to get it on a roll\nYou'd literally be amazed how quick I go through a zone\nBut \"more money, more problems to fix\" --\nWe all know the motto, still we trying to get rich\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Do What I Gotta Do"}]}
