It's fantastic\nI can lend you the VHS if you fancy it\nDamn, I'm rambling\nDamn I didn't meen to say \"damn\"\nDamn, I just said \"damn\" again\nI'm a bit anxious I'll be tagged as discriminatory\nSimilarily to your religion's history\nI know what it's like to have a stigma stick to you\nYou were in the hitler youth\nI was in the local scout troop\n'til the parent found out that Baloo\nLiked bare Cubs a little more than he should do\n\n[Verse 2 : Dan Bull]\nAnd that's what I'd like to discuss with you\nThe sick stuff some kiddy fiddlers are into\nIt's like sometimes you're less inclined to find the truth\nThan to hide the abuse under your roof\nYou're quick to stick it in when other people sin\nSo why are you so unwilling to take this one on the chin?\nYou might think that it isn't my business\nBut you're into forgiveness, so forgive this:\nYour hollow apology bothered me horribly\nIt'd probably be better if you'd not said a fucking thing\nMy God, I just swore at the Pope, I'm so sorry, honestly\nNow that's an apology\nNot just promising to modify your policy\nModerately to smother the controversy you've often seen\nIt's sick, depraved system failure\nIt isn't just as if it's \"misbehaviour\"\n\nYou find out you're hiring a kiddie rapist and you don't even make a criminal complaint, it's insane\nIf this was any other organisation\nYou'd be taken straight down the station to make a statement\nNow not all papists are rapists\nAnd the clergy isn't permanently pervy but face it:\nThere's a disproportionate amount of cases;\nIt's almost as if they happen on a daily basis\nYou're the Holy See's head of state and\nLoads of people want to see your head on a plate\nNow I won't go that far,but it's fair to say\nThat from this day\nThings better change\n\n[Outro : Dan Bull]\nJesus preached: love one another\nBut it seems some priests just want to bugger\nJesus preached: love one another\nBut it seems some priests just want to bugger\nSome priests just want to bugger\nSome priests just want to bugger", "year": "2010-09-12"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
