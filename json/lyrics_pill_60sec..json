No one cares, but it happened\n\nIt's the dance that all the kids have been talking about\n\nWe call this dance mass hysteria:\nPut your hands behind my neck\n- press swiftly -\nTo promote someone else\u2019s revolution\nUnder the guise of my appearance\n\nReading warfare strategies in my travel magazines;\nMaybe when the conflict\u2019s over we should vacation there?\n\nAll those things that make you bad?\nWho knows? No one cares, but it happened\n\nContemporary colonialism -\nWhat a pretty thing I can buy for myself\n\nDoing our part with minimal effort", "year": null}]}
