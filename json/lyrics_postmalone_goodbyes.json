I'm watchin' the fight\nI flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark\nYou're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj\nYou don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger\nI just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered (Yeah)\nAnd I don't want ya to never go outside (Outside)\nI promise if they play, my niggas slidin' (Slidin')\nI'm fuckin' her, and the tour bus still ridin' (Ridin')\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Chorus: Post Malone]\nI want you out of my head (Head)\nI want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)\nThere's no way I could save you (Save you)\n'Cause I need to be saved too (Saved too)\nI'm no good at goodbyes\n\n[Outro: Post Malone & Young Thug]\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye, bye)\nI'm no good at goodbyes\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye (Bye, bye)\nI'm no good at goodbyes", "year": "2019-07-05"}]}
