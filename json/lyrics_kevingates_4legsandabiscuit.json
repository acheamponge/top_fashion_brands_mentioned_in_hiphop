Ozi out on bail, for a charge he caught with that dealing\nBack when we was little, want us a Pickle Dilly\nInnocent making faces in the window while having dinner\nWho'd ever think that we'd grow up and turn out to be killers\nBarrel extensions, tool is narrow and slender\nCompact in my jacket, even flinch I might hit ya\nShot too hard in the heart, my emotions are ruined\nToo hard to trust, don\u2019t give a fuck, won't open up to no woman\nTake my lick and keep pushing, don\u2019t try playing me, pussy\nAR-15 with the i/r-beam, laying down in the bushes\nWon\u2019t say no name but so and so lent me a pound of them cookies\nTTGTHUG, L.I.F.E, I\u2019m with it\nIf shawty bust her pussy open, no commitment, I sinned it\nLord forgive me I\u2019m sinnin\u2019, I come to you as a sinner\nTake all my scars, take my heart, turn me into a Christian\nBright nigga in the paint as if my last name was Griffin\nPopeye's chicken, I just want 4 Legs And A Biscuit\nI always shout to chi-towns, all my niggas in Folsom\nStuck to the code, even when the pressure on, we ain't folding\nLet\u2019s get it on"}], "artist": "Kevin Gates"}
