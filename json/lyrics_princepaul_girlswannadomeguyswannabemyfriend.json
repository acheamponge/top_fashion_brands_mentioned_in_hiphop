I was way up her alley\nGirls wanna be down, guys wanna be paley-waley\n\n[Verse 2]\nMale groupies stuck to tour bus windows like they're bugs (windshield wipers!)\nLove letters turn into hate-mail when they don't get hugs\nWe love your back abstract, I believe you are my peers\nDon't gotta be high end to be my friend\nGot to have been friends for twenty five years\n[?] rap a critic had girls and asked us to share 'em\nSo my man and I got separate hotel rooms and separate whole damn harems\nWhen I was done one kissed my sons off another one's gums\nWomen wanna hump, men wanna be chums\nDJ Paul made a song and asked me to get on it\nYour girl wears a thong, it's got shit on it\nMy ego's so big, it takes ten days to sightsee\nLadies fall in lust, fellas like-me like-me\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo son it's not all about pimps, whips and chicken heads\nOr else you'll end up eatin' shrimp chips, sick in bed, skippin' meds\nAnd lickin' eggs (Pow!)\nI ain't scared of no psychotic bomb\nMy mom knows I love her, my fans know I'm a problem\nAnd that's word to my peoples growing fat in New York City\nWhat was once my third nipple's now a true forth titty\nIt's not [?] yet you continue to blunder\nI gave 'em info\nWomen know, men wonder", "year": null}]}
