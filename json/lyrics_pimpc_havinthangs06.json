(fly hoes and chains and swangin' thangs)\nY'all remember that shit? (remember that shit?) Talkin 'bout?\n(Just another young playa havin' thangs man...)\nCheck this shit out... uh!\n\n[Verse 1: Pimp C]\nIt's really goin' down in the God damn South\nYoung girls poppin' pussy with them golds in their mouth\nYoung boys comin' up, layin it down in the cut\nNever fallin' in a rut cause life was made for us to strut (strut!)\nNever take for granted, take the bull by the horns (horns!)\nSippin on somethin' sweet, blowing green popcorn (corn!)\nI'm trill, I'm country 'til the end my nigga\nThe underdog, young hog, fuck the pen my nigga!\nCuz it's a waste of bodies (bodies!), a waste of time (time!)\nA waste of spiritual energy, and a waste of mind (mind!)\nYou ain't really tough cause you been down there fool\nEverybody tryna get back to they families on the cool\nI rather grip on grain (grain!), get head in the lane (lane!)\nYou can have them hoes' bodies, I'm possessing they brains (possessing they\nBrains!)\nComin up on 'em in a wide-body frame\nHoping you ain't forgot the name, I'm out here havin' thangs!\n\n[Chorus: Pimp C]\nFly hoes and chains and swanging thangs\nJust another young playa having thangs man...\nFly hoes and chains and swanging thangs\nJust another young playa having thangs man...\n\n[Verse 2: Big Mike]\n(Yeah! Big Mike y'all! Yeah!)\nFrom CD sales to jail cells\nFrom diamonds that shine to eatin' slop straight up off a chow line\nFrom walkin' that fine line uhh, to 12 jurors decidin' mine\nFrom bein' free, to bein confined\nFrom bein' loved, to bein despised, many times I cried\nFor not allowin' that bullshit to slide\nIt was a pill that I couldn't swallow - load up the strap with the hollows\nAfter takin' to the head a whole bottle\nI did that, not thinkin' twice about the consequences\n'Til I served damn near 4 years behind the fences (Straight G)\nAll my folk were like, \"Big Mike, you trippin\"\n\"Get it together,\" if I could I woulda done somethin' different\nUh! From G-walkin' to slippin', yeah, to flippin' them calendar pages\nDay after day, sweatin' 'em out in them cages\nPatiently waiting on the day when I can.. get back at it\nWork that magic, collect that cabbage, I gotsta have it\n\n[Chorus: Pimp C]\nFly hoes and chains and swanging thangs\nJust another young playa having thangs man...\nFly hoes and chains and swanging thangs\nJust another young playa having thangs man...", "year": "2006-07-11"}]}
