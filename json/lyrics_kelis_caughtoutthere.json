(NO)\nYou don't come home to me (oh no)\nWhen you don't come home to me (man)\nCan't deal, can't bear\nYou keep tellin' me lies\nBut to your surprise\nLook, I found her red coat and you're (bitch)\nCaught out there!\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate you so much right now\nI hate you so much right now\nAaaaaaaaaaaah\nI hate you so much right now\nI hate you so much right now\nI hate you so much right now\nAaaaaaaaaaaah\nI hate you so much right now\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo sick of your games\nI'll set your truck to flames\nAnd watch it blow up, blow up, tell me\nHow you gonna see her now?\nSo far from sincere\nFabrications in my ear\nDrive me so far up the wall, I come slidin' down\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat is this I see (I don't believe this)\nYou don't come home to me\nWhen you don't come home to me\nI can't deal, can't bear (I won't)\nYou keep tellin' me lies but to your surprise\nLook, I hope you're happy since you're\nCaught out there\n\n[Interlude]\nYeah, you've been caught (Yo come on)\nYo, yo, yo yo yo\nYo, yo, yo yo yo\nCome on\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate you so much right now\nI hate you so much right now\nAaaaaaaaaaaah\nI hate you so much right now\nI hate you so much right now\nI hate you so much right now\nAaaaaaaaaaaah\nI hate you so much right now\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe's so raunchy, so vulgar\nNot me, why the hell her?\nLook she dresses, a mess (Look at her)\nWhat do you see? (I don't know)\nIt's not all about cash (hell no)\nNor how much you flash\nHow I dress is a reflection of me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhat is this I see\nYou don't come home to me\nWhen you don't come home to me\nCan't deal, can't bear (told you I won't)\nYou keep tellin' me lies\nBut to your surprise\nLook I got something for y'all since you're\nCaught out there\n\n[Chorus]\nI hate you so much right now\nI hate you so much right now\nAaaaaaaaaaaah\nI hate you so much right now\nI hate you so much right now\nI hate you so much right now\nAaaaaaaaaaaah\nI hate you so much right now\nI hate you so much right now\nI hate you so much right now\nAaaaaaaaaaaah\nI hate you so much right now\nI hate you so much right now\nI hate you so much right now\nAaaaaaaaaaaah\nI hate you so much right now"}], "artist": "Kelis"}
