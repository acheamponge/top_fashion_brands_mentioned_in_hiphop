My team did it\n25 MCs backstage chilling\nMandem are drinking, mandem are billing\nI knew this already but my scene's winning\nChanged your whole culture? My team did it\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen they offered this much, I said no\nWhen they offered that much, I said no\nWhen they added some more, I said no\nCan't do it, the money too low\nI told them I run this sector\nI'm the E3 energy collector\nI roll in a team with Skepta\nWiley's a road yout, man sold food in a clapped out Vectra\n\n[Hook]\n25 MCs backstage chilling\nMandem are drinking, mandem are billing\nI knew this already but my scene's winning\nChanged your whole culture? My team did it\n25 MCs backstage chilling\nMandem are drinking, mandem are billing\nI knew this already but my scene's winning\nChanged your whole culture? My team did it\n\n[Verse 3]\nCall me up around half past ten\nLike \"Wiley, when we going radio again?\"\nAnd I reply like \"let me check, who's on bro?\"\nSo I can make sure that it's cool with them\nI know so many MCs who are all fire\nIt's the truth, don't call me a liar\nIf it ain't bars and skills then I don't wanna listen\nI like to hear what's better, that's my main mission\n\n[Hook]\n25 MCs backstage chilling\nMandem are drinking, mandem are billing\nI knew this already but my scene's winning\nChanged your whole culture?
