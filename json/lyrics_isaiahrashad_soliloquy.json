Why we gotta lease that?\nWhy we can't own that? All these fed loaners\nAin't no forewarning came bombing and I'm just Vietnam\nIf you gon' be trippin' like a bitch, you should be a mom, see the son", "image": "https://images.genius.com/88da1904fb461fae943c2c34f20bda85.600x600x1.jpg", "album": "Cilvia Demo", "year": "2014-01-28"}]}
