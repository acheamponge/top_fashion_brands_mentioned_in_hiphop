Slater style on your girl's shoulder, then have a cold soda\nIf you ain't with me roll over\n\n[Verse 2: Retchy P (Retch)]\nMy mind marinate in drug sauce\nThe private driver's name is Gustaf\nThe cuff links is like a slut's cough\nSo disgusting, english muffin\nWith the butter at the Yiddish luncheon\nWith my pimpish cousin\nHe sport the slick-back clean\nAnd I inquired howd he get that\nPaused and said a bitch is a bitch\nI twist the spliff while I sit in the six\nThe classic LO sweaters sit on the prince\nThumbs in the belt loop, as i pose for the pic\nMy boyish element, I blessed your residence with elegance\nTurning entire rooms into elephants\nStepped in the building\nThe doorman resemble Marcus Garvey\nFerrari cake at the party\nWheeled in by Steve Harvey\nHe had the freshest line in the building\nHe stunted on mine, it was my party\nAnd he tarnished my shine  got mad and had him escorted out\n\"Vincent, get 'im outta my sight\"\nAnd Missy Elliot had started a fight\nBusta Rhymes was on a molly\nFrom afar you thought it was Kane, but it was Body\nCatch a chokeslam if you try to try me\nMonday night catch me wilin' at the bingo house\nJust left the dog show, you know I brought Ringo out\nHe won a ribbon, brandished it on the side of his coat\nI went outside and I was offered a smoke, I declined politely\nI rock the Jordan sole that's kinda icy\nMy drug of choice you know is kinda pricey\nNiggah", "title": "Flip Ya", "album": "Blue Chips 2", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3tkvpk6nyazea6ub0nsnj8s01.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2013-11-01"}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
