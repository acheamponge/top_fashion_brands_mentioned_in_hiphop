Come get it and get an eye missing\nEvery verse that I spitted is a special limited edition\nMy words and spiritual worlds a perfect marriage\nBringing you that scary footage without them stupid shaking cameras\nParanormal Activity raw with the depths of my depravity\nThese visions in my head got me walking the edge of insanity\nI'm the nightmare that will easily wake up Tim Burton beastily\nNever peacefully, there's curtains a surgeon carving you up evenly\nThe uncooked flesh that I eat wears prepared in demonic boil\nBile encapsulated in vials and mixed with cemetery soil\nFor artists with no need for Thesaurus to bring verbal horrors\nAnd for the end I'm leaving you skinned like that movie Martyrs\nIt's proven of all rulers I'm the most ghoulish\nFuck who you and your crew is\nI'll catch you on your cruise ship and decapitate you\nAnd I'm using your skull as congas\nMy movement is an animal unleashed\nWhen I preach my creature speech\nIt's utter madness, like cow disease\nMy haters can't excel our tasers [?] in hell\nI'm sicker than a schizophrenic hermaphrodite raping itself\nFuck out of here\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]\n\nYou looking for trouble? You found it, I'm right here\nI rip the track in fucking half, you just a slight tear\nI run with rowdy motherfuckers who don't fight fair\nRight there, stomp his fucking head in with the Nike Airs\nI'm colder than polar motherfucker, the white bear\nI'm from Philly it ain't that motherfucking nice here\nThe manifestation of holiness is right here\nMy fascination with loneliness in the night air\nI think it's common knowledge, you don't wanna fuck with me\nIf I'm your bunkie, you wouldn't wanna be stuck with me\nPussy boy soaking wet like a buck fifty\nJohn Rambo, take his fucking guts with me\nJust waiting until this Goose and this fucking dust hits me\nYou ain't Aaron Fuchs, you ain't from a tough city\nI was Killadelph, brothers Puff 'nough izzy\nI throw a left right leave a sucker duck dizzy, stupid"}], "artist": "Blaq Poet"}
