(Who made these rules?)\nWe're so confused (We're so confused)\nEasily led astray\nLet me tell ya that...\n\n[Chorus 2]\nEverything is everything\nEverything is everything\nEverything is everything (everything)\nAfter winter, must come spring\nEverything is everything\n\n[Verse 2]\nOur philosophy\nPossibly speak tongues\nBeat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist\nRap this in fine linen, from the beginning\nMy practice extending across the atlas\nI begat this\nFlipping in the ghetto on a dirty mattress\nYou can't match this rapper slash actress\nMore powerful than two Cleopatras\nBomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti\nMCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti\nMy rhymes is heavy like the mind of sister Betty (EL Shabazz!)\nL-Boogie spars with stars and constellations\nThen came down for a little conversation\nAdjacent to the king, fear no human being\nRoll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum\nNow hear this mixture, where Hip Hop meets scripture\nDevelop a negative into a positive picture\n\n[Chorus 1]\nNow everything is everything\nWhat is meant to be, will be (what is meant to be)\nAfter winter, must come spring (must come spring)\nChange, it comes eventually (change, it comes eventually)\n\n[Verse 3]\nSometimes it seems\nWe'll touch that dream\nBut things come slow or not at all\nAnd the ones on top, won't make it stop\n(won't make it stop)\nSo convinced that they might fall\nLet's love ourselves and we can't fail\nTo make a better situation (better situation)\nTomorrow, our seeds will grow\nAll we need is dedication\nLet me tell ya that\n\n[Chorus 2]\nEverything is everything\nEverything is everything\nEverything is everything (everything is everything)\nAfter winter, must come spring\nEverything is everything (everything is everything)\n\n[Chorus 1]\nEverything is everything\nWhat is meant to be, will be\nAfter winter,  (after winter) must come spring (must come)\nChange, it comes eventually"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
