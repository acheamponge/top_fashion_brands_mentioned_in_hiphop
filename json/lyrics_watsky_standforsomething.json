You gotta be bat shit\nTo want to be a piece of meat, we treat em as cold cuts\nBut go nuts when we see em wiping their own butts\nAnd the crowd goes wild\nBut we don't smile if you got no style\nGotta be kidding me, giving the pretty people the key to the city\nI don't even know\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe struttin\nAin't nobody gotta tell us nothing\nBecause a rose is a rose and I am what I am\nAnd I wear it like campaign button\nI don't want a side eye\nI say bye bye\nRoll up another one and hand me a Mai tai\nBecause the people who be running the show\nAre kinda like the season how they come and they go\nAnd we'll be living while they looking for parking\nAnd we'll be digging while they woofing and barking\nThey kicking in the door and hoping to barge in\nBut this is what you get there's nothing to bargain\nIf it's a hundred to one and we're under the gun\nI'm not gonna be groveling for the governor's pardon\nDon't gotta suck in your gut if you want to guzzle a Bud\nI'm about it baby, you can party with us", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0199ac49c667975a2b0c5188cae549aa.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "All You Can Do", "title": "Stand for Something"}]}
