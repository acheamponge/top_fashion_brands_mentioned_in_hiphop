Cole's Warm Up and let it play\nI thank god for blessin' me with life every day\nAnd to my peoples who've gone, we'll meet at Heaven's gate\nI've been sellin' haze, but I'm sure there's better ways\nThat I can get my pay, I just need to get it straight\nNothin' left to say now it's time for action\nNo more bullshit, no more relaxin'\nRappin's my passion, so I stay writin'\nSpend a couple nights and\nBurn out all the lights in\nMy room, stuck in my crib like glue\nThat's what I do it's nothin' new\n\n[Hook]\n'Cause it's just another night on my own\nLayin' back as I light up my Dro\nIt's just another night alone\nI spend another night alone\nSaid it's just another night on my own\nLayin' back as I light up my Dro\nIt's just another night alone\nI spend another night alone", "year": "2011-01-01", "album": "The High Life", "title": "Another Night"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
