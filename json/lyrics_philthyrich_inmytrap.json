"[Chorus: Johnny Cinco]\nThis my trap (this my trap)\nThis my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)\nThese my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)\nSip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)\nThis my trap (this my trap)\nThis my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)\nThese my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)\nSip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)\n\n[Verse 1: Johnny Cinco]\nGet my pack\nGet my gun, get my bomb\nPull up foreign, shit, pull off foreign\nCodeine in my lungs, I don't even know where I'm goin'\nAin't no pressure on the block\nYoung nigga sellin' on the block\nLearned a lot of shit on the block\nYoung nigga settin' up shop\nWe ain't gon' play around with these boys\nWe ain't gon' play around with these toys\nTreat these whips just like they toys, yeah\nDrive these cars just like they toys, yeah\nWe get to the money, I know what they love, yeah\nI walked in the club, they know I got my slug here\nNow they lookin' at me, how he got these drugs here?\nI jumped off the porch, jumped in a brand new Lamborghini\nWent from sellin' dope, robbin' niggas, servin' cement\nWent from eating noodles, now lobster fettuccini\nRan the money way way up, you wouldn't believe it\n\n[Chorus: Johnny Cinco]\nThis my trap (this my trap)\nThis my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)\nThese my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)\nSip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)\nThis my trap (this my trap)\nThis my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)\nThese my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)\nSip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)\n\n[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]\nNew foreign with the roof gone, no rebate, no coupon\nRose gold bust down Patek, no stainless steel, no two-tone\nThirty thou on a new chain, told a broke nigga keep the loose change\nRed bottoms, no shoe strings, this Actavis give me mood swings\nRollie on with the big rocks, turn my bitch spot into a trap spot\nNinety days out of this spot then we relocate to the next spot\nHundred inch out of Best Buy, got a bad bitch out of Bed Stuy\nTold a bitch catch a red eye, bitch you'll be here like in no time\nSince I bought it I ain't set the time, ain't the same watch, this a different kind\nVS1's got a different shine, man them niggas funny like Richard Prior\nIn the trap, I was in the trap, I ain't never seen you niggas in the trap\nYou ain't never bust down a pack, you ain't never greased down a MAC\nActavis with the seal on it, Hi-Tech with the seal on it\nMotor four, put a deal on it, fuck you and your big homie\nSem God, bitch it's rent time, nigga pay up or get kicked out\nIn the trap with the stick out\nWe done sold out, they done missed out, it's Philthy\n\n[Chorus: Johnny Cinco]\nThis my trap (this my trap)\nThis my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)\nThese my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)\nSip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)\nThis my trap (this my trap)\nThis my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)\nThese my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)\nSip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)\n\n[Verse 3: VL Deck]\nI put your bitch to work, run noon\nBitch I rap 'bout what I say, I talk how I move\nPressin' 'bout the paper, that's the only mood\nServin' out the rental, bitch been part the old school\nTask force got 'em scared, bitches won't move\nBlock on Juvenile but this bitch still boom\nZombies in the line comin' for that dog food\nSpot look like the Carter, shootin' up in the bathroom\nI'm a different bracket jackin', we don't fuck with y'all\nAnd Judo cook the best, he stretch it with the [?]\nEvery day I'm movin', I can't lie, I'm with the action\nNunez goin' for thirty-two, I touch 'em then I'm cappin'\nIf you want a sixty, got it packed off in my past street\nPints startin' to drown so these niggas startin' to tax me\nAnd they steppin' on the dope like they tap dancing\nSmokin' OG when I'm in the mountains, Uncle Larry\n\n[Chorus: Johnny Cinco]\nThis my trap (this my trap)\nThis my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)\nThese my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)\nSip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)\nThis my trap (this my trap)\nThis my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)\nThese my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)\nSip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)\n\n[Outro: Johnny Cinco]\nBustdown, that's a bustdown\nTry to touch my bustdown, you get bust down\nAll these bales get bust down, these bricks get bust down\nCali plug just touched down, we in a rush now\nThis my trap (this my trap)\nThis my strap (this my strap), this my pack (this my pack)\nThese my racks (these my racks), this my Act (yeah, hey)\nSip my Act (sip my Act), count these racks (yeah, hey)", "year":
