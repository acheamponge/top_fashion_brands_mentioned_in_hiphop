I can't\nCome on Dewey! Join the party!\nNo Dewey! You don't want this. Get outta here!\nYou know what I don't want no hangover, I can't get no hangover\nIt doesn't give you a hangover!\nWell, I get addicted to it or something?\nIts not habit forming\nI don't wanna, overdose on it\nYou can't OD on it!\nIt's not gonna make me wanna have sex is it?\nIt makes sex even better\nSounds kinda expensive\nIts the cheapest drug there is", "year": null}]}
