I am!\nSo what\u2019s the deal? Huh!\n\n[Hook: Problem]\nI remember when you told me\nThat you'd never leave me\nBut that ain't what you showed me\nWhen you up and ran away from us, away from this\nAway from life, away from kids\nAway from hugs, away from love\nAnd everything I thought we both wanted\nThat\u2019s when I found out you wanted something else, else, else\nThat\u2019s how I found out you wanted something else, else, else!\nThat\u2019s how I found out you wanted something else, else, else!\n\n[Verse: Terrace Martin]\nUh, same man, changed woman\nFeels like I\u2019m begging when I know I shouldn\u2019t\nGave you everything them other men wouldn't\nDid you take away my love when I wasn\u2019t looking\nYeah, that\u2019s what it seems like\nYou\u2019re in love with me, but only in the meantime\nLate night texting, convos with your exes\nI ain\u2019t even press you, even though I seen the messages\nGotta speak your mind and let it out\nOr let me go, guess you got some things to figure it out\nBaby, just do you\nI tell you what, don\u2019t even call, and let me do me too!\nI couldn\u2019t be the man for you\nSo hopefully when you meet somebody, you tell him the truth\nUntil then, get your mind right!\nI wish you the best! I\u2019m on the quest for real love\nAnd you can keep the stress, I\u2019m gone, gone!\n\n[Hook: Problem]\nI remember when you told me\nThat you'd never leave me\nBut that ain't what you showed me\nWhen you up and ran away from us, away from this\nAway from life, away from kids\nAway from hugs, away from love\nAnd everything I thought we both wanted\nThat\u2019s when I found out you wanted something else, else, else\nThat\u2019s how I found out you wanted something else, else, else!\nThat\u2019s how I found out you wanted something else, else, else!"}], "artist": "Terrace Martin"}
