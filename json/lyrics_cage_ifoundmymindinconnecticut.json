That line\u2019s from Wes Eisold\nGoes from good to bad, from bad to fucking worse\nShe said she wouldn\u2019t judge me then a gavel fell from her purse\nMy brain left me in PA, departed CC\nThen begged me take it back crying in a bar in CT\nLife is so strange, so is God with games\nThe one wrapped tightly around me like a dog with mange\nKick me in the stomach, I shit myself in the damn street\nLeft for dead, wanna be knocked out like that but can\u2019t sleep\n\n[Hook x 2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI lay and lurk with kooks, pain hurts but suits\nWhat if Ian Curtis were to climb down from the noose\nThat\u2019s what I thought that dangled from my neck in amazement\nStruggled, undo hanging myself in my own basement\nSometimes I think I should be more private, keep it secret\nBut the open book of my life, is it really worth reading\nCover to cover, there\u2019s something pointing towards leaving\nDon\u2019t give a fuck what you think, when you finish I\u2019m not breathing\nYou think the world of a girl and she becomes your world\nAnd then you lose your grip regardless of what you curl\nYou clean yourself up you get laid more, great work, Columbu\nTruth is she just fucked me cause my bro is D. Palumbo\n\n[Hook x 2]"}]}
