You babylon\nYou out ya mind\nAnd you need to be in it\nSo here take this joint and sip this liquor\nListen to your counselor cancel your dream\nAnd tell you everything that impossible\nEven if you believe\nAnd you conform like a bitch\nWear your uniform to the stitch\nOh your favorite player was Tmac?\nImpossible don\u2019t exist?\nRemember that?\nBravo bravo, give him a clap\nEncore encore when he end his act\nDownload download if he in a rap\nWith utmost respect, better tilt a hat\nKill a track\nCondolences\nDoberman doggin\nNo folding, I\u2019m all in\nBadu, I\u2019m evolving\nTil school year next august\nHopefully by then I\u2019ll be talking\nYou are in\nComfort Zone", "album": "GETCOMFORTable"}], "artist": "Saba"}
