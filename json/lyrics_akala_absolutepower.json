{"songs": [{"title": "Absolute Power", "lyrics": "[Hook: Akala] X2\nAbsolute power corrupts absolutely\nBut absolute powerlessness does the same\nIts not the poverty\nIts the inequality that we live with everyday that will turn us insane\n\n[Verse 1: Akala]\nIn a scheme of livin' my life wasn't hard\nBut as far as britain goes shit I practically starved\nSleeping in a track suit, gas meter runnin' out\nElectric cut off as well, candles lightin' up the house\nLookin' in my momma's eyes I see how she feels\nThe strain and the pain of just paying bills\nIt ain't real, and thats how I grew like so many more\nAnd it is part of who I am\nI am very sure\nYou wanna know the rage I feel in my stomach\nKnowing my mum and dad split up when I was still in her stomach\nAnd not everything that happened I will put in sixteens\nBut I will tell you enough so you will know what I mean\nMy boy's mother got cancer the same time as mine\nHis mother died, and mine survived\nThe shit was fucked back then\nWhen I was like ten already had the mental strength\nMore than many grown men\n\n[Hook]\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis was a couple years after my step-dad left\nDid he really know the crazy mess that he left?\nCos mum done' recovered from the lumps in her neck\nBeing poor and alone just couldn't cope with the stress\nAnd I earn my big sis for\nSo much soul that night hattan left school\nWhen she left home\nI was thirteen by now\nStill a little kid, innocent\nNext couple years though would turn him 'to a militant\nThat is the result of no food in the fridge\nAnd every other day being searched by the pigs\nFuck these patronizing teachers\nDon't want my grades 'slip, trynna' emasculate me\n-yeah turn me 'to a bitch\nAnd I dont mean a woman please lemme be clear\nI mean a spineless man 'cos what do they fear\nThan a working class black male with a brain\nWhen our energy is harnessed, every changed\nLook at 'Pac look at Marley look at Hendrix look at Garvey\nThis is the potential that is wasted on a daily basis\nIn this racist, classist world that we live in\nStill we comin' from nothing but we educate millions\n\n[Hook: Akala]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI understand why it scares you\nIts like how dare you\nOvercome obstacles that we have been careful to\nPlace in your way every step of the way\nIn this so called democracy where kids get sprayed\nBlacks and the Asians, Turks and the chavs\nCrowded in council flats, living like ants\nAnd who's more confused than the poor white trash\nSpouting the bullshit about they want their country back\nIt never was yours, you should read more\nWhat they did to brown people they did to their own poor\nPeoples memories short, so much that I'm seeing\nBlack and Asian kids cussing eastern Europeans\nNo pot to piss in, makes competition\nI fail to see how this is an effective system\nCats and dogs in America and Britain\nEat better food then most of humanity\nWe spend our technology only on killing\nHow is this more than sophisticated savagery\nIts like its said, the world is a stage\nEach person's just an actor with a part to play\nLike the middle class kids, - kids of the rich\nHave everything, but yet still they pissed\nOn coke and ketamine, strung out on heroin\nI ain't generalizing, look at the evidence\n\n[Hook]\n\n\n[Verse 4]\nGo to Glastonbury any year you will see\nUnlike carnival it won't be crawling with police\nThis is London, the kids on the very next street\nHad a very different life experience than me\nIn my experience they can't help but be smug\nAfter a lifetime of what they think's just good luck\nThey're still more anxious and more thankless\nUnearned privilege weigh's like an anchor\nThat's why they copy what we do, tryna' be what they not\nThey will grow up though and get better jobs\nThey will maintain the system they claim that they hated\nBut they can't burn it down they got a stake in this matrix\nHip-hop is just a fad to them, you didn't know?\nBut to us, this our living breathing soul\nAnd yeah they might backpack in South America\nOr even volunteer in an African village\nBut all said and done, push comes to shove\nAnd shit hits the fan they're middle class and British\nThat's just how it is\nMost rich black people are just as full of shit\nSo more concerned with their cars and jewels\nBut most of the worlds poor looks just like you\nSo more concerned with their cars and jewels\nBut most of the worlds poor looks just like you\n\n[Hook]", "year": null, "album": "Knowledge Is Power Vol. 1", "image": "https://images.genius.com/95f4dbc07c7455e0bbf14b55f99cc7a0.918x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
