Ever been abandoned? Lived in a bando?\nCan take off who I am though\nThis has made me who I am\nYea, I been outcasted\nTake a lil crash and take a heart and smashed it\nMind, body, soul\nYea, they want all of those\n\n[Chorus]\nAll the cards I was handed\n52 Pick Up, nigga this a stickup\nAll the cards I was dealt\nNigga do the dash, no seatbelt, oh well\n\n[Verse 2]\nNiggas tryna ban\nTell them niggas to ban me\nTell them niggas to ban me\nI gotta feed the family\nIts gon' come in\nIts gon' come in handy\nPut your hands where I can see 'em\nNiggas tryna live life through me\nJealousy, ain't never did shit to me\nYou can keep your front\nKeep up your front\nIt's just coming to me\nKeep it coming to me\nKeep it coming to me\n\n[Chorus]\nAll the cards I was handed\n52 Pick Up, nigga this a stickup\nAll the cards I was dealt\nNigga do the dash, no seatbelt, oh well\nAll the cards I was handed\n52 Pick Up, nigga this a stickup\nAll the cards I was dealt\nNigga do the dash, no seatbelt, oh well\nAll the cards I was handed\n52 Pick Up, nigga this a stickup\nAll the cards I was dealt\nNigga do the dash, no seatbelt, oh well\nAll the cards I was handed\n52 Pick Up, nigga this a stickup\nAll the cards I was dealt\nNigga do the dash, no seatbelt, oh well\nOh well\nOh well\nAll the cards I was dealt\nNigga do the dash, no seatbelt, oh well"}]}
