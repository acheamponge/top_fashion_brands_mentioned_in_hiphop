I'll never know now\nSprite is extra dark now, my doggie in the dog pound\nThey say I'm on the come up, but I've been on the come down\nSee me doin' good, they start to hate, that's how it goes now\nI don't know why they mad at me, I always stay ten toes down\nDrivin' through my city by myself, that's how I roll now\n\n[Chorus]\nDrivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends\nWhen I'm sober I just don't like who I am\nPour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again\nRoll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again\nI'ma break every box they try to put me in\nI got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends\nPour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again\nRoll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again\n\n[Verse 2]\nI remember being a kid my teachers told me I wouldn't be shit\nDiamonds in my pinky, look like water, make me seasick\nNever had no help so don't approach me on some free shit\nDid this by myself so why the fuck would I do a remix?\nHis bitch gave me top, don't want the pussy, he can keep it\nMoney and the power, fuck respect 'cause I don't need it\nDrivin' to the west, I popped a bean and now I'm speedin'\nKnow some people in the 6 that dissed me for no reason\nSending shots, they sendin' shots, on road I never see them\nTaking Ls, they takin' Ls, I never wanna be them\nGot your bitch beside me, she just asked me what a bean is\nPut her number in my phone, and you know I delete it\n\n[Chorus]\nDrivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends\nWhen I'm sober I just don't like who I am\nPour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again\nRoll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again\nI'ma break every box they try to put me in\nI got a lot of enemies who used to be my friends\nPour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again\nRoll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again\n\n[Outro]\nDrivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends\nPour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again\nI'ma break every box they try to put me in\nPour me up a 4 and I'll feel like myself again\nRoll me up some dope and I'll feel like myself again\n\nDrivin' solo, I'm just swervin' through my ends"}], "artist": "NAV"}
