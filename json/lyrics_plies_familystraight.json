I sit and wonder\nWe ain't close like we should and it's taken us under\nThe only time we come together is to have a funeral\nSit around and talk about each other and spread rumors\nKnow it's some of my fault cause I don't talk to 'em\nFor my family to be happy, that's all I want\nHelp my grandma fight, God I know she don't\nTo see my momma retire, that's all I want\nHope my brother get out to see his kids for once", "year": "2008-12-16"}]}
