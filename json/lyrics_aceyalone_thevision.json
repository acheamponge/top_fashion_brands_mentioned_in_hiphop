{"songs": [{"lyrics": "Today\nSunday\nOn the nineteenth day of October at One a.m\nNineteen ninety seven\nI had a vision\nNo, well not exactly like a vision\nNo but like a sight\nWell not exactly like a sight but like a dream\nYeah like a daydream\nLike two scenes short of a nightmare\nExcept I wasn't scared\nLooking at the lines of these mean mugs\nExtremely super beamed up drugged\nInduced with extra juice in their jugs\nTry'na hold a tight hug\nTo tonight's pocket rocket\nWith a flicker of a spark in their eye socket plugs\nMy shoulders shrugged as to the meaning of this encounter\nTrying to find something to read into\nWhat's this going to lead into?\nA lesson or just another brother confessing?\nEither way he's expressing mind\nBut I was pressing for time\nNow show me some type of sign that your words are divine\nBut he just stood there\nSpeechless\nChoked up\nHis talk box all broke up\nWith no real use of his God giving any more just living\nI watch 'em all walk into the flames\nWhen they could walk into the vastness of their brains", "title": "The Vision", "album": "A Book Of Human Language", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c348dfe824da4f3b04231c7e4d629ae.700x700x1.jpg", "year": "1998-04-14"}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
