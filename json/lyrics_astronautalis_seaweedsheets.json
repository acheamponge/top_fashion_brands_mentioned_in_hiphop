(We, we lost it all again)\nI picked some sand up in my hand to watch it all leave\nThe wrecking ball did fall, you kissed me on the mouth, (We, we lost it all again)\nWe rolled around in your sandy bed...until I finally snuck out\nWe lost a lot in that hurricane, again till everything came back again... (We, we lost it all again)\nFloating in, floating in, floating in, floating in\n\nWe washed our feet in the ocean but they never came clean. (We, we lost it all again)\nI picked some sand up in my hand to watch it all leave\nThe wrecking ball did fall, you kissed me on the mouth, (We, we lost it all again)\nWe rolled around in your sandy bed...until I finally snuck out\nWe lost a lot in that hurricane, again till everything came back again... (We, we lost it all again)\nFloating in, floating in, floating in, floating in\n\nWe washed our feet in the ocean but they never came clean. (We, we lost it all again.....)", "year": "2006-05-23"}]}
