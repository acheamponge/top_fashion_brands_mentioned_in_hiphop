D-D-Dammit man\n(Pitbull)... D-D-Dammit man, D-D-Dammit man, Dammit man\n(Lil Jon)... D-D-Dammit man\n(Pitbull)... D-D-Dammit man, D-D-Dammit man\n\n[Hook] (x4)\nWhen you see dem boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!)\n\n[Hook*]\n(What? Fuck with us, what)\nY'all really can't fuck with us\n(Fuck with us, what)\nY'all really can't fuck with us\n(Fuck with us, what)\nY'all really can't fuck with us\n(Fuck with us, what)\nY'all really can't fuck with us\nY'all really can't fuck with us\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'ma kill 'em in the club with this one\nI'ma tear the club the fuck up\nI'ma have 'em goin' to war over this one partna, just listen\nIf you don't want those things to click-clack\nTake a few steps back because I'm playin fo' keeps\nGo ahead keep playin with me and watch how I hit 'em in the head once again\nFor those who didn't believe in the kid y'all might as well be dead\nBecause what y'all thought couldn't be done, I did\nI'm like Ray Charles dawg, I don't see none of y'all\nI'm blind to the fact that half of y'all rap and I'm outrunnin y'all\nWhen I hit 'em from the back I got them mami's saying dammit man\nWhen I put it in they mouth I got them mami's saying duh-huh-huh-muhh (Time out! Whooo)\nWhen I hit 'em from the back I got them mami's saying dammit man\nWhen I put it in they mouth I got them mami's saying duh-huh-huh-muhh\nPut that up dammit\nBut me and you both know that these niggas ain't ready\nThey're just too petty, I'm just too deadly (Whoo!)\n\n[Hook] (x4)\nWhen you see dem boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!)\n\n[Hook*]\n(What? Fuck with us, what)\nY'all really can't fuck with us\n(Fuck with us, what)\nY'all really can't fuck with us\n(Fuck with us, what)\nY'all really can't fuck with us\n(Fuck with us, what)\nY'all really can't fuck with us\nY'all really can't fuck with us\n\n[Verse 2]\nPitbull's that underrated underdog killin' the underground\nBut that's just an understatement\nIt's hard to understand why I'm still underpaid\nJust look in my blue eyes and see the hunger and pain, dammit man\nBut I don't plan it man because I do what I wanna do\nMove what I wanna move\nY'all gonna see what I mean when I live out my dreams\nI'mma tell you like Biggie told me, cash rules everything around me\nI could give a fuck about what you say about me\nCause when those things get pulled out and squeezed they'll spray about three\nHit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, give it up, thats how it goes\nPit's gon spit it up, flip it up, rip it up, but I'm a pro\n(Time out! Whooo)\nHit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, give it up, thats how it goes\nPit's gon spit it up, flip it up, rip it up, but I'm a pro\nSo all ya'll amateur ass niggas do-don't try this shit at home\nPit's co-co-comin, runnin, gunnin fo-for that throne\n\n[Hook] (x4)\nWhen you see dem boys 'round your way, holla dammit man! (Dammit man!)\n\n[Hook*]\n(What? Fuck with us, what)\nY'all really can't fuck with us\n(Fuck with us, what)\nY'all really can't fuck with us\n(Fuck with us, what)\nY'all really can't fuck with us\n(Fuck with us, what)\nY'all really can't fuck with us\nY'all really can't fuck with us", "year": "2005-04-09"}]}
