Don't get burned\n\n[Verse One]\nYeah, the streets full of crime\nEvery momma's boy wanna slang dimes\nThe streets full of people\nWalkin' round, doin' somethin' illegal\nMentally takin' you the farthest\nBefore you run into a con artist\nUh, full of smokers, arguin' over lighters\nToo many voices, not enough writers\nThe streets full of girls on their merry way\nOn their knees, tryin' to get a nut everyday\nAskin' the Lord for some strength\nCertain facilities I don't want to get sent (Pre-trail)\nThe streets full of guns\nToo much to have a home, the streets is the slums\nFull of dreamers\nLick hittin', night time schemers\nThe dope game ain't goin' down soakin'\nUntil enough motherfuckers stop smokin'\n\n[Hook]\nHurtin'\nI been hurtin'\nWe been hurtin'\nHurtin'\nThey been hurtin'\n\n[Verse Two]\nSeem likes ever since my birth and\nIt feels like I been hurtin'\nPockets ain't on swoll\nMy tennis shoes don' got old\nDon't want to work no 9 to 5\nIn '94 I was waitin' for the Goodie Mo to get live\nAnd they gonna talk about these pros\nThat I caught wearin' other niggas clothes\nWaitin' around the house\nSlap the taste out your mouth\nUh, then boil it up and get a hundred when I sell it\nYou know I'm funky you can smell it\nOr inhale it\nThen you might be high\nYou just might see why\nI no lie\nPeople I'm in a crisis\nAnd you don't give a damn cause it ain't your fuckin' life it's\nMine\nRight?
