Damn right you losing\nKeep the pole on me won't catch me snoozin\nAnd these bitches they be choosing\nStacking money to the ceiling, bitch we balling\n\n[Verse 1: King Rell]\nYou losing, damn right you losing\nAnd These niggas tryna copy my swag buy they might lose it\nCause I'm balling. And this money steady calling\nSo you know what I gotta do: I'ma flex on you\nPull a brand new coup if you only knew\nThe things that I would do and my niggas they'll shoot\nAnd we balling. Damn right we balling\nAnd I got your bitch, she steady stalking\nAnd if you only knew the things that she do\nTaking off the clothes off that what she do\nCause our money grew. And we balling\nAnd these other niggas ain't on nothing\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: YB]\nDon't know what you did heard about\nBitch niggas we not worried about\nCome to where you hang out\nAnd blow yo fucking brains out\nKing Rell, I'm the man now\nTell them goofies fucking stand down\nThey got a bag get they hands out\nAin't got not time for no hand out\nYeah you know I got a bag\nFlexing on them fucking fags\nGot to get it everyday\n84th where I lay\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Durk]\nGot me balling we call em out we all in\nBad bitches they foreign we all winners they all ten\nFufu niggas hate on me hard\nThey turn it down when they see my squad\nVersace just to get yo bitch on all my jock\nGot thirty shots in that Glock.
