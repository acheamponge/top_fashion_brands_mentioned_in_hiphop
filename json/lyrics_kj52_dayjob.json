Johnson]\nJust like momma said oh just like momma said\nI should\u2019ve never quit my day job\nI should\u2019ve never quit my day job\nI should\u2019ve never quit my day job\nI should\u2019ve never quit my day job\n\n[Verse 2: KJ-52]\nSometimes I wonder what I'm rapping for\nFirst I\u2019m Eminem now I'm Macklemore\nThey box you up they wanna stick you in a category\nI'm never stuck I dodge the bull like a matador\nStank eye walking in the door\nRap game Larry Bird but I\u2019m in another sport\nI break ankles and I shatter boards\nAnd build a ladder to the God that I\u2019m rapping for\nBut they never ever seem to get it tho\nSome say I'm tobyMac others thought I'm Mineo\nSome think I'm only wack others think I'm criminal\nStuck up in the middle like rap game little bro\nStanding here feeling like a jerk\nHolding a pose with a fan till my hands hurt\nCause her man can never make the cam work\nWhile they holding up another rappers fan shirt\nIf I was still a traffic cop\nCould be working homicide but now\n\nWhat you think about that what you think about that?\nI should\u2019ve never quit my day job\nI should\u2019ve never quit my day job\n\nNow straight off people think I\u2019m straight odd\nCause I praise God and rapping is my day job\nI'm sitting on plane waiting just to take off\nDude trying to guess what I do but he way off\nFirst I'm a DJ now I'm just a drummer\nSays KJ-fifty-two, that's a funny number\nI been doing this like 20 summers\nI took the diss but I reminisce kind of wonder\nWhat if I never quit my day job?\nJust pulled a 9 to 5 trying to get my cake off\nWould the ones that you saved would\u2019ve strayed off\nI'd rather struggle in the will of God then lay off\nHate all well you can say that I Straight soft\nLife is a game and I\u2019m gunning for the playoffs\nSo I\u2019m glad to say I never quit my day job\nAnd I\u2019ll never be ashamed or try to play God\n\nIf I had stayed at that flower shop\nI could\u2019ve been a manager but now\nWhat you think about that what you think about that?\nOh what am I to do\nProbably should\u2019ve went right back to school\n\n[Chorus: Sean C. Johnson]\nJust like momma said oh just like momma said\nI should\u2019ve never quit my day job\nI should\u2019ve never quit my day job\nI should\u2019ve never quit my day job\nI should\u2019ve never quit my day job\n\n[Verse 3: Sean C. Johnson]\nHello Miss Johnson\nWill paper or plastic be ok\nOk\nYes, yes still working on the music thank you\nThank you for asking\nOk, I won't quit my day job, thank you ma'am\nYou need help with these to the car?\nNo? Ok, well you have a nice day, Miss Johnson, ok\nI hate this job"}]}
