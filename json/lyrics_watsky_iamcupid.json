Bush asking Saddam Hussein to be his Valentine\n\nDon't say peace in the East is a fleeting mirage\nI know Sweden be needing a Swedish massage\nI see Eden right here and I'm fiendin the cause\nby the evening I'm leaving to see that this heathen gets Ireland, England, and Whales to minage\nBasically George Porgie's pushing for a diplomatic orgy\n\nUganda, Botswana, Guyana, Peru\nNamibia, Libya, India too\nAfghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Kirghiizistan, Kazakhstan tell 'em I'm comin' for you\nI'm gonna get all the tanning oil and give the world a sensual full body massage\nDislodging misogyny causing a total global collage and going rope-a-dope on folks who go for broke on breaking hope and groping fraud\nSo Cupid just quit his deskjob, Bob\nand this vigilante love god's marauding on uncharted ground\nthe standard rounds of applause lauded on liberally living the cause\nGiving the flaws a bit of the credit of breaking the laws and giving me migraines my pain is the refrain of a symphony of sympathy sweeping the planet\nDamnit I've got a blazing arrow and I'm not afraid to plant it right in your ass if you've got one ounce of anti-romantic Semitic semantics in you that you wanna pass off as true\nIf you're a threat to global harmony I'm comin' for you\nNot to hurt you just to show you what some lovin' can do\nThe age of fighting is through, we'll be as close as superglue\nIf you get off your ass and show some goddamn love to Cupid too", "image": "https://images.genius.com/15e329cac8808712e9bcdedd4c1b05fd.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": null, "title": "I Am Cupid"}]}
