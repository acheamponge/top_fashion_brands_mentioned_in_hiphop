Wuz Here", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nSee, I was made in my father's image and they belittle my deeds\nTheir lust for convictions pledge allegiance to the almighty power and greed\nSee seeds born, withered parents, still children, adolescent in their ways\nSome preachers false prophets educated pigeon droppers using our sins to get paid\nSlaves; give them freedom but give them dope\nTake away their leader, 'cause that give them hope\nSell them dreams of changing things like they were never kings and queens before\nAs small as a giant\n\n[Hook]\nAs small as a giant, I'm still ridin'\nHand on my sword good Lord I need time\nWatch for the sun-eaters blocking our shine\nEnlighten my kind, reason for rhyme\nI'ma find Zion, free my soul\nRepent for all the things I done until my eyes closed\nWhen the boat man come I'm paying my toll\nOutside the gates of Heaven, pray to God I'm chose\nAs small as a giant\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe beginning was kinda dark, not too soft fairly hard\nDrenched with love from my mother, connected to her struggle\nTill she cut me loose, now what shall I do?\nIt was oh-so-easy, look at how they treat me\nEver since she pushed me through\nNow put me back in and stop these contractions\nWater breaking, aw damn I know it's bout to happen\nFailed to fix, no picket fence, a dream deferred\nBeer and liquor chillin' with my niggas swishas and herb\nEviction notices, hopelessness thrown on my shoulders\nGod won't give you more than you can handle\nCarry these boulders, give it all I got until I get older\nCouple medals on my sleeves cause life made me a soldier\nReminisce on how it was way back when\nBut some things were better off way back then\nAs small as a giant, a promise so divided\nProbably ain't surprised in so long\nSince we sung such over Lord's camp fires\nCosby's was cool but television is a lie\nSome reason I relate to survivor\nFresh Prince but no Uncle Phil\nThe Carltons that I knew never stayed where we lived\nCouldn't play with those kids\nWhen they were reading books\nWe were playing cops and crooks\nWhen they was writing essays, I was writing hooks\nMama I'll be that nigga on TV\n'Cause people like Bow Wow and Soulja Boy make it look easy\nNo Pun intended, hoping they get offended\nI'm throwing up if these niggas spittin'\nDidn't write it but recite it like puppets on strings\nBelittled as a peasant but my bloodline is of kings\nKnight in shinning armor for this rap shit, I slash quick\nFar as a man spit leaving gashes on these industry bastards\nThey can't see what is real, don't know how I feel\nThey weren't raised where I live\nIn Mississippi\n\n[Hook]\nAs small as a giant, I'm still ridin'\nHand on my sword good Lord I need time\nWatch for the sun-eaters blocking our shine\nEnlighten my kind, reason for rhyme\nI'ma find Zion, free my soul\nRepent for all the things I done until my eyes closed\nWhen the boat man come I'm paying my toll\nOutside the gates of Heaven, pray to God I'm chose\nAs small as a giant\n\n[Verse 2]\nRise and shine, no time for sleep, thinking bout eating\nLeaving this place long gone\nI get no service on this earth I need to phone home\nDid too much dirt to talk to God, nowadays I get the dial tone\nTry again tomorrow, my heart filled with sorrow\nMy family broke too so why bother try trying to borrow\nNo car, no house, drug dealing\nFeeling like it might be my only option to get millions\nWhat else could I do? Put yourself in my shoes\nIf you had no whip you'd take some shortcuts too\nTheir ain't no time to be wasted, the world is going under\nNowadays can't tell fall from spring and winter from summer\nI wonder if this was meant to be\nMaybe all the bullshit was meant for me, takes a lot of energy\nBreak these chains and erase these thangs\nSociety put up on our brain\nHow could I explain it, we ain't free yet\nObama cool but he ain't sending me no free checks\nThey killing all my niggas Lord forbid I'll be next\nNo now, got too many sorrows to say and\nKisses to give, they don't feel how I feel\nThey weren't raised where I live\nIn Mississippi\n\n[Hook]\nAs small as a giant, I'm still ridin'\nHand on my sword good Lord I need time\nWatch for the sun-eaters blocking our shine\nEnlighten my kind, reason for rhyme\nI'ma find Zion, free my soul\nRepent for all the things I done until my eyes closed\nWhen the boat man come I'm paying my toll\nOutside the gates of Heaven, pray to God I'm chose\nAs small as a giant"}], "artist": "Big K.R.I.T."}
