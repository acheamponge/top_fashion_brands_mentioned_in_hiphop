Tell a hater get back\nBut I don't really care\nGet the crowd like yeah\nSo yeah let's do it, this that new shit\nY'all cats clueless\nCuz this about to happen just off rapping\nIt really got me laughing\nThink so much man I really need an aspirin\nSo what is they really asking? I got all the answers\nI got all the answers\nI said I got all the answers\nI got all the answers\nI got all the answers\n\n[Hook]\nChilling in the hood, but it's all good\nYeah it's all good\nI'm kinda misunderstood but it's all good\nYeah it's all good\nThey ask me how is the wood I'm like it's all good\nYeah it's all good\nMy girl says I don't treat her like I should but it's all good\nYeah it's all good\nI got some growing to do man, but it's all good\nI said it's all good, yeah it's all good\nI said it's all good, yeah it's all good\nIt's all good\n\n[Outro]\nMan... tired as hell\nAnd I got school tomorrow\nMan what time is it... 1:55 in the morning\nStudio\nNeed to go home, and I got homework?!\nDamn\nOh well, it's all good"}]}
