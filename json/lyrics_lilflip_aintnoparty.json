Mmmm, oh, that's right. Mmmm\nProm night, Oscar night, got all that BS beat\n\nThere's twenty girls for every single boy\nAnd their crazy from this heat\nWe'll take you up and down and everywhere in between\nMom and Dad are out of town all week\nSo you better get on your feet\n\nIf you can not find the lyrics you want, You may want to request them\nLet's go down. Wash that sugar down\nAin't No Party\nBecause there ain't no party like the party going on in my house\nBetter believe that it's gonna be the biggest night of the year\nBecause there ain't no party like the party going on in my house\nBut it would be so much better if you were only here\nMmmm. Oh I think it's gonna get hot tonight\n\nBrothers and sisters moving in together so\nSo nice and tight\nEverything you ever wanted from this life is gonna happen right now\nOooh, those girls tend to hide (?)\nAnd the temperatures rise\nBetter reach for the sky and raise up the ceiling. ...\n\nBecause there ain't no party like the party going on in my house\nBetter believe that its gonna be the biggest night of the year\nBecause there ain't no party like the party going on in my house\nBut it would be so much better if you were only here\nIf only you were here"}], "artist": "Lil Flip"}
