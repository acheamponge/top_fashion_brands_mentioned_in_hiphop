Even this music's a heavenly melody\nFrom the Father telling me to quote to you what he said to me\nIf I wasn't embedded with the Spirit he fed to me\nLife love and joy as I know it'd only be dead to me\nBut I was resurrected with Christ, the kingdom's prepared for me\nIf you receive and believe it's a joy you can share with me\nCome on!\n\n[Chorus - J.R.]\nAmazing Grace\nI once was blind but now\nYour grace has let me see\nThank God I've been redeemed\nAmazing Grace\nI once was lost but now\nBy your grace now I'm found\nPraise God I've been redeemed\n\n[Verse 2 - Json]\nThe Lord doesn't hurt your position, true repentance will get you out of that state\nEscape the hand of his wrath, receive the plan of his grace\nListen, I know it seems like the world has a lot it could offer you\nAnd because of it its hard for you to hear that he's calling you\nLet me talk to you about the void that you feel\nYou try to replace it with things but the joy isn't real\nI had that, filled myself with the fame and the money\nAnd all my quest was still stressed \u2018cause my flesh it remained hungry\nThe pain was there, through all the herb I was cheefing\nIt was plain it would be the same until I fervently seeked him\nThen seeked him, then saw the urgency of me and my sin\nIt's an emergency we believe upon him\nLook, dawg I'm knowing that the streets is real\nAnd them dudes carry heat for real, listen to me for real\nGod, he is realer than that\nReceive him before he really comes back, 'cause that's what real\nCome on!\n\n[Chorus - J.R.]\nAmazing Grace\nI once was blind but now\nYour grace has let me see\nThank God I've been redeemed\nAmazing Grace\nI once was lost but now\nBy your grace now I'm found\nPraise God I've been redeemed\n\n[Verse 3 - Json]\nLord, my earnest prayer is for my family tree\n'Cause it would be (timber!) without you standing with me\nI pray, somehow that they would get a glimpse or a picture\nConsistent conviction whenever we'll mention the Scripture\nHell is hot, I can't give a drop on the tongue\nAnd in the streets, believe you can leave at the cock of a gun\nMy homies: this world ain't it, please put your eyes to the light\n'Cause who's my mother, who's my brother if their lives ain't in Christ?\nI guess, Matthew 10 and 34 is the key\nWhat he came to be, \u2018cause there's this war between you and me\nFam, I love you but you're on that side of the fence\nI just wish he'd quicken your heart, 'cause I can try to convince\nI cry and insist, but without the tears on my cheeks\nFor years I would weep, praying you would hear when he speaks\nSincere with my speech, if you opened your ears I could reach\nI've been sent here to preach through this song here with the beats, so listen\n\n[Chorus - J.R.]\nAmazing Grace\nI once was blind but now\nYour grace has let me see\nThank God I've been redeemed\nAmazing Grace\nI once was lost but now\nBy your grace now I'm found\nPraise God I've been redeemed"}], "artist": "Json"}
