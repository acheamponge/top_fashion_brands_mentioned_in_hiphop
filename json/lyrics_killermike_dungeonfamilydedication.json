Why isn't him and Big on TV man\nThem boys still down? Organized goin' through changes\nAll I know is that Big here, Dre gone, moved on\n(Scratched) All I know that Big here, Dre gone, moved on\n(Scratched) Big here, Dre gone, moved on\nChanged names from Aquemini to Purple Rib-bon\nMy first album slept on, failed to do a mil\nBut yet and still, my babies haven't missed a meal\nGod damn, is there a curse on Dungeon Fam?\nThe Goodie Mob broke up, the DF album didn't jam\nBefore Lil Jon had the grill in his mouth\nKhujo Goodie had the dreads with the grill in his mouth\nAnd Bubba Sparxxx gave you the phrase new south\nLike Cool Breeze gave you the phrase dirty south\nIs it only me? Or does Pharrell sometimes remind niggas of\nSleepy Brown back in '93?\nI know its been like 12 Decembers (yeah, suttin' like that)\nLet's remember \"All the playas came from far and wide\"\nYeah suttin' like that, talkin playalistic Cadillac\nIn the trap with +Two Dope Boyz+\nSpittin Organized Noize via microphone\nDo you believe The Source gave only gave 4 and a half microphones\nThey shoulda gave that a classic, ax Charlie Braxton\nDamn man, I'm still amazed\nThe boys had the nerve to boo Big and Dre\nWhen they hit the stage to accept the Source award\nMy heart dropped like a million other country boys\nI thought my Mind was Playin Tricks like the Geto Boys\nDamn man, I miss the interludes by Big Rube\nHe gave us knowledge that they wouldn't give us in school\nSo our mind wasn't so sick\nSpeakin' of being sick man I need a doctor\nWhich doctor? Bring back the Witch Doctor\n(Scratched) Feelin' me, bring back the Witch Doctor\nFeelin' me, here's an interesting fact from me\nWhen the boy Bobby V signed with DTP\nHe spit about blackberry molasses over Organized beats"}]}
