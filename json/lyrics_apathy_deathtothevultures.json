I shouldn't give a fuck right ?\nIt's a bad look, but what's worse ?\nSaying something that I know Is right\nOr not saying nothing, When these fucking clowns\nDisrespect who you love, Who's a sucker then ?\n\n[Refrain]\nI do this for my culture\nTo my very last breath\n[2x]Screaming death to the culture vultures\nScreaming death to the ...\n\n[Verse 1: Apathy]\nFor all the dues I pay\nFor all the crews I slay\nFor all the fights I've fought\nFor all the mics I've rocked\nFor every crate I carry\nEvery rapper I bury\nEvery rapper that I love is lying in the cemetery\nEvery dollar I spent, and every night I went hungry\n'Cos I've bought rap albums when I saved my lunch money\nEvery time I had a memory attached to a song\nSoundtrack to my life, thank God this is long\nEvery song I dedicated that got me some ass\nAnd for the walkman in my back that always got me through class\nThis is for my squad, Demigodz for life\nI wouldn't even be here if It wasn't for Open Mic\nAnd if it wasn't for Celph and me and Louie out in Harlem\nI sacrifice my life with a mic, not for stardom\nEvery rhyme I wrote and note books I filled\nMC's I killed, Studios I've chilled\nEvery time I billed with dudes who I look up to\nFor those who fronted, fuck you, I could probably crush you\nThis is for the underdogs and underachievers\nFor all my blown speakers, the amps and receivers\nAn addict for sneakers\nThis Is for all the professors and teachers\nConsider that as a death threat for vultures and leeches\nNas verses that sound like Malcolm X speeches\nAnd every corner of the planet that this Rap reaches\n\n[Refrain]\nI do this for my culture to my very last breath\n[3x]Screaming death to the culture vultures\nI do this for my culture to my very last breath\n[3x]Screaming death to the culture vultures\n\n[Verse 2:Apathy]\nFor every sucker I diss to dismiss\nNow they cease to exist\nFor the clones that I've crushed\nTurn they bones into dust\nFor the snakes who deceive\nAnd I ain't even believe\nAll of the swagger they leave\nI'm brushing off of my sleeves\nFor the tapes I wore out, with all the titles rubbed off\nFor these vultures, they soft\nTell the fakes to fuck off\nFor all the cyphers where I've stood\nAnd every borough and hood\nAnd for the freestyles I kicked to show them rappers was good\nAnd If you counted all the notebooks I purchased\nTo scribble these verses\nYou could probably cover the Earth's surface\nFor miles on the whip, all the styles I've flipped\nFor all the talk behind my back with the smiles I get Cause I really pay dues, fuck YouTube views And if I keep killing mics, I know I never lose\nFor the fans, for my fam, for the man I am\nPan Ams to Japan, suitcase in my hand\nFor Connecticut, I had to put my state on the map\nAnd for these fuckers trying to take rap, I'm taking it back\nFor the posters on my wall, magazines I cop\n12 inches I drop in Long Island's cop shop\nFor them Nike sneakers For those nights staying out past curfew with Jerk Crew\nKnowing if you get caught your parents'll hurt you\nFor these motherfucking vampires sucking us dry\nI hope you choke on a dick and get nut in your eye, bitch\n\n[Refrain]\nI do this for my culture to my very last breath\n[3x]Screaming death to the culture vultures\nI do this for my culture to my very last breath\n[3x]Screaming death to the culture vultures\n\n[Outro]", "year": null}]}
