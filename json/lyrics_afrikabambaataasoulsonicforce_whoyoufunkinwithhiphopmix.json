Soundin' like who?\nMake up a name straighten up your game\nLivin' like who? Breathin' like who?\nAnd now we're here with the lesson for your ears\nMessin' with who? Funkin' with who?\n\nEchoes are heard and all of the word\nAbout the first street jam that took the lid off the can\nWe are the juice that fills the cup\nEverybody took a sip and got all funked up\nSome people fell down and moved with a trance\nAnd when they sobered up it was called break dance\nEvery fair's like a [?] in my musical chair\nAnd if you dis and [?] you was considered to be a square\n\n[Hook]\nWho do you think you're funkin' with? Huh, who?\nWho do you think you're funkin' with? Huh, who?\nWho do you think you're funkin' with? Huh, who?\nWho do you think you're funkin' with? Huh, who?\n\nBack in the days, we're on a reign\nWhere the mighty street gangs were a popular name\nBull [?] hearts and guts, were surely a must\nWe're talkin' about who? We're talkin' 'bout us\nTwo dollars a head and the king of the pack\nWith a one dollar [?]\nThe DJ plays his record, upon his thrown\nWhile we the MCs rock the microphone\nLike the [?]\nYou thought you were the best with your fake jack game\nYou thought you were a king, but you're just a pawn\nAnd now all of your knights and gonna get stepped on\n\nWe left the footprints in the sands of time\nAnd now we're gonna leave on in your mind\nAll the king's horses and all the king's men\nWill never wanna funk with us again\n\n[Reprise]\nThinkin' of a beat that'll make you move your feet\nCuttin' like who? Scratchin' like who?\nMakin' up a rap that'll make your hand clap\nTalkin' like who? Soundin' like who?\nMake up a name straighten up your game\nLivin' like who? Breathin' like who?\nAnd now we're here with the lesson for your ears\nMessin' with who? Funkin' with who?\n\nThe gem, the jewel, the power to be cool\nThe ones that made it straight from the old school\nThe writers, the fighters, that builders to provide us\nThe ones that made it better for all you biters\n\n[?]\nWe took you to the bridge and we dropped ya off\nYou bit all you can chew so now get lost\n\n[Hook]\nWho do you think you're funkin' with? Huh, who?\nWho do you think you're funkin' with? Huh, who?\n\n[Melle Mel]\nOn the thrown of stone I sit alone\nWith the undisputed ruler of the microphone\nMy polo [?] is the clothes I wear\nThe crown is the braids in my hair\nI do push-ups like the ones in jail\n[?] in the street like I'm out on bail\nBut I never do time for takin' the crime\n'cause my name is Melle Mel and the streets is mine\n\n[Mr. Biggs]\nPaint in your mind homeboy a picture\nYou're my student I'm your teacher\nI can tell through the years you've been listenin' well\nBut I totalled up the score and I'm sorry you failed\nBecause if you bite a style it can't be exact\nDamn homeboy I taught you better than that\nI would've told you how to [?] and make it better\nMy name is Mr. Biggs and I'm a trend-setter\n\n[Pow Wow]\n[?]\nAnd if you think you're ready come and get a taste of this\nPow will make you feel low\n[?]\n\n[MC G.L.O.B.E.]\nSimply comprehend the reason I ascend\nTo the height of light that accumulates strength [?]\nThe historical being known as MC G.L.O.B.E\nThe G-L-O-B-E baby\nNow if your main goal is to be like G.L.O.B.E\nI hate to bust your bubble but that's a no-no\nIt's inevitable [?]\nInevitably you could be the G-L-O-B-E\n\n(Outro)\nShake it baby shake it shake shake it baby\nShake it baby shake it shake shake it baby\nShakin' it baby shake it shake shakin' it baby\n(Who you funkin' with)\nShakin' it baby shake it shake shakin' it baby\nShakin' it baby shake it shake shakin' it baby\n(Who you funkin' with)\nShakin' it baby shake it shake shakin' it baby\nShakin' it baby shake it shake shakin' it baby\nShakin' it baby shake it shake shakin' it baby\n(Who you funkin' with)\nShakin' it baby shake it shake shakin' it baby\nShakin' it baby shake it shake shakin' it baby\n(Who you funkin' with)\nShakin' it baby shake it shake shakin' it baby\n(We ain't takin' no shots)\nShakin' it baby shake it shake shakin' it baby\nShakin' it baby shake it shake shakin' it baby\n(We ain't takin' no shots)\nShakin' it baby shake it shake shakin' it baby\nShakin' it baby shake it shake shakin' it baby\nShakin' it baby shake it shake shakin' it baby\nShakin' it baby shake it shake shakin' it baby\nShakin' it baby shake it shake shakin' it baby\n(Who you funkin' with)\nUntil end", "title": "Who You Funkin\u2019 With?
