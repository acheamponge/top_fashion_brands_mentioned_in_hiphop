I don't know my nigga\nLet's blow, hey yo you got another swisher?\nLight the gan up, c'mon roll with a nigga...\n\n[Verse 2]\nJust another day in the streets of the D\nGas on high and my tank on E\nThese hoes wanna fuck but they charge you a fee\nAnd the work might cost but to murder is free\nPray and holler at my man 'cuz he owe me a few\nGan in the air, with a Bud Ice brew\nNarco's ride, so I took my sack\nAnd before hop on the lines 'cuz I know its packed\nBreak bows, so I ride slow, slow\nHit the Coney's cause my gas low, low\nCop a bag, roll a blunt and say to extras\nAnd I swoop a couple hoes then ride up Dexter\nBlow my trees, no stress at all\nGan in mine but it's stress in y'all\nHit the crib get dressed as soon as the sun fall\nRight now I'm just rhyming, timing my phone calls\n\n[Hook]", "year": null}], "artist": "Danny Brown"}
