No\nPorn? Hell, no\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe in this bitch shakin' like a Rick Ross seizure\nShe say she want a piece of pizza, my dick like Little Caesar's\nJust to fuck with you, she gon' grab the tweezers\nYou try new shit, eat ass just to please her\nMe, I don't, neither, got wet hoes by the liter\nShe say just to measure me, she gonna use some meters\nBut I ain't talkin' 'bout meals, doe\nShe ain't a lesbo, but she know the dildo\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nShe a freaky bitch, young dog, new tricks\nDo a split on the dick, won't stop movin' like she got to piss\nShe can hang like a nigga gettin' lynched\nTake off my shirt, pull hoes, I think I'm Prince\nShe play Rose actin' like she can take the pain\nI can keep it wet up in that thing like Purple Rain\nI'm Ashanti, you can make it rain down on me\nBitch, please\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 4]\nNow she moanin' like Lisa, give me head like teaser\nShe callin' me daddy so I call her Mother Teresa\nAnd I'm strapped up like [?], treatin' hoes [?]\nHit your ho with some Bordeaux and I'm out, bitch, like tally-ho\nNo cyber-sex, no hanky hoes\nUgly, but look good on her avi, doe\nIf I'm not smacking, then I'm packing\nNo dilly-dallying, this is the finale\n\n[Chorus]"}]}
