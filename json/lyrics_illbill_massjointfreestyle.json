We know you're in there! Come on out with your hands in the air!\nCome in here motherfuckers! Come on I'm waiting for you! Oh you ain't coming in? OK, I'm coming out! You ready? HERE COME THE PAIN!\nFreeze!\nDon't fucking move!\nFuck you\nAsshole!\nI'm gonna fucking blow you away right now!\nFuck that!\nHey! I'm gonna shoot you in the FACE!\nDon't fuck with me!\nRequest backup. 1200 South Main\nYou think he'll kill a cop?\nThey're not gonna shoot a cop\nHey cop! *BANG BANG BANG*\nI'm a fucking cop!\nTake that motherfucker!\nShot's fired!\nOfficer down!\nWhy you stupid fuck... Look at you now!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0a90bfb78ca3b59dddbc55e9b9209108.400x400x1.jpg", "album": "ILL Bill is the Future", "year": "2003-02-11"}]}
