The fists of the north and south aren't ever supposed to fight, you know that!\n\n[Shin] Perhaps that was true once, but now rules are meaningless. Defend yourself!\n\n*Both Scream and Attack*\n\n[Outro: Diabolic (Method Man Sample)]\nSoldiers pump your fists!\nThis that punch you in the face and fuck your girlfriend type shit. Apathy, Diabolic, Sleeper Cell motherfucker\nFuck ya!\n\n(I'm the true fist of the North Star)\n(I'm the true fist of the North Star)\n(I'm the true fist of the North Star)\n\n[Sample from the film The Holy Mountain]\n\"With the correct formula, any human being can become enlightened.\"", "year": "2018-03-02"}]}
