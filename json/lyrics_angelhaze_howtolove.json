How could you?\"\nI just told her that I'm pursuing my dreams\nBesides, I'll be back for you, sing a rap for you\nI'm outta this world, lemme draw a map for you\nI had to stand on my own, got no back issues\nBut when you all on your own, that's when your past hits you\nTrue love is hard to come by\nI stole you heart- is that a love crime?\nYeah? Well if so, you should sentence me\n25 to life, all alone, with no memory\nSo I can't remember you, you would remember me\nBut not as a love, more like I'm an enemy\nThere's no \"love bug\", she won't get a love bite\nNiggas did it wrong, now she wouldn't love right\nYeah, it's young Ant, no Bug's Life\nI'm about to blast off, no Buzz Light\n\n[Angel Haze:]\nYou had a lotta people try to tell you what it was\nBut even the perfect words couldn't tell you what it is to love\nAy, how to love\nAnd you had a lotta people try to paint the perfect picture\nBut with all that repetition couldn't tell you when it is my love\nAy, it's not love\n\nAnd you had a lotta people try to steal your heart\nHad a lotta people try to feel your spark\nHad a dead end try to be your start\nHad a lotta people try to play that part\n\nSee, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever\nBut when you at the bottom, and things can only get better\nMy love, ay, my love\n\nAnd you had a lotta people try to tell you different things\nDon't know it when you feel it, you gonna know it when you see\nMy love, ay, ay, my love\n\nAnd you had a lot of people try to tell you was it was\nBut even the perfect words couldn't tell you how it feels to love\nAy, how to love\n\nAnd you had a lotta people try to keep it like a secret\nSo I love you when you mean it, not only when it's convenient\nMy love\nCause you my love, yeah", "year": null}]}
