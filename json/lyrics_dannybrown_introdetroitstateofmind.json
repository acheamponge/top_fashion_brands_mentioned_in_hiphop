Ain't that my cigarette hanging off the tip of your lip?\nI ain't even give him a chance for his confession\nJust leveled his ass with all that aggression\nLefts, rights, to the [dolex?]\nHahahaha!\nFoots to the chest, uppercuts to the grill\nI'm like, \"Kill!\"\nHe's like, \"Chill!\"\nTake that! For.. for me even being in this place!\nTake that! For that fucking C.O baton across my face\nFeel that! For that lawyer who ain't give two fucks about me\nAnd feel this! feel this! For me being enslaved by poverty... Motherfucker\nGive me them damn cigarettes\n\nOh these is Marlboros, I don't smoke these", "year": null}], "artist": "Danny Brown"}
