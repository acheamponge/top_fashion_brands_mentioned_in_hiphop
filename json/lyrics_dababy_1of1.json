living if you make decisions off of other people opinion (Not really livin')\nI'd rather be different, don't care what they think about me, that ain't none of my business (That ain't none of my business)\nThey\u200a don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)\nThey don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)\nI knew from the beginning you wasn't my nigga, you do too much for some attention (I knew from the beginning)\nI can't fuck with these niggas, I can't let 'em trick me, sorry I am no longer friendly (I am no longer friendly)\nThey\u200a don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)\nThey don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI regret to inform you that I am not normal, sorry, they no longer make 'em like me\nI just received a text from my bitch from the west, she said later on she gon' come suck me to sleep\nIt's a hell of a difference between me and these other niggas, my presence will light up a room\nIt's almost like magic, but I'm no magician, my music non-fiction, my words are the truth\nThese niggas be lyin', but that there ain't none of my business\nCreating an image that don't even fit 'em\nExpressing they feelings in effort to gain some attention\nThese niggas remind me of bitches\nAnd God is my witness, they exaggeratin'\nThey imagination is not like the life that they livin'\nMy worst fear, deep illustrations of my life, it all seem so basic\nThey stole my appearance (Woo)\nMy wordplay a barbarage these niggas can't fathom\nI just started rappin', I'm rippin' up tracks\nGot my foot on the gas and I'm not lookin' back\nI'm dropping my nuts on these niggas, I'm applying pressure\nYour thoughts are irrelevant, fuck what you telling me\nNot playing catch-up, I'm two steps ahead of 'em\nFuck is a soldier compared to a veteran?\n\n[Chorus]\nYou not really living if you make decisions off of other people opinion (Not really livin')\nI'd rather be different, don't care what they think about me, that ain't none of my business (That ain't none of my business)\nThey don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)\nThey don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)\nI knew from the beginning you wasn't my nigga, you do too much for some attention (I knew from the beginning)\nI can't fuck with these niggas, I can't let 'em trick me, sorry I am no longer friendly (I am no longer friendly)\nThey don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)\nThey don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI had to slow down on the second verse, my vocab might be too exquisite\nFor most of these basic ass niggas to listen, they don't understand it, they won't pay attention\nThe same conversation held with different women (Keep it pimpin'), give the best advice that I can give 'em (Keep it pimpin')\nI tried to tell 'em I was different but most of them hoes ain't understand the difference\nOne of a kind, you'll find a nigga like John, let me meet him (I wanna meet him)\nI tell my bitches all of the time that I'm not a cheater (I'm not a cheater)\nAnd they believe me, got 'em calling me Baby Jesus (Baby Jesus)\nThat lil' nigga that sold the Impala and bought the Beamer (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)\nAnd that beamer got a whole lotta hoes on it (Them hoes)\nI set the trend I was the first one with the gold on it\nAnd them niggas lyin' if they tell you otherwise\nI'm one of one, not like them other guys\nPay too much attention to niggas opinion\nDiscussing they business, what the fuck kind of life you livin'?\n\n[Chorus]\nYou not really living if you make decisions off of other people opinion (Not really livin')\nI'd rather be different, don't care what they think about me, that ain't none of my business (That ain't none of my business)\nThey don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)\nThey don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)\nI knew from the beginning you wasn't my nigga, you do too much for some attention (I knew from the beginning)\nI can't fuck with these niggas, I can't let 'em trick me, sorry I am no longer friendly (I am no longer friendly)\nThey don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)\nThey don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more (They don't make 'em)\nYou not really living if you make decisions off of other people opinion\nI'd rather be different, don't care what they think about me, that ain't none of my business\nThey don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more\nThey don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more\nI knew from the beginning you wasn't my nigga, you do too much for some attention\nI can't fuck with these niggas, I can't let 'em trick me, sorry I am no longer friendly\nThey don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more\nThey don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more", "album": "NonFiction",
