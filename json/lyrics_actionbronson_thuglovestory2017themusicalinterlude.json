I got so much shit.\"\n\nBronson: \"...Lost in the street life...\"\n\nL.E.S. Ezra: I'm lookin' for this lady\n\nBronson:\n(There you go, there you go!)\n\nL.E.S. Ezra:\nShe's special to me\nSo if by chance you see her\nWon't you hit me on the hip, will you please?\nI went to Red Cross and I went to the station\nI looked up missing persons\nAnd I found out that she wasn't there\nDid she find, did she find\nDid she find someone new?\nIs it true?\nDid she find, did she find\nDId she find someone new?\nI hope it's not true\nMy sister came over with no smile on her face\nShe said, \"You better sit down\"\nIt's gonna hurt, what she has to say\n\"That baby's not yours, she belongs to the streets\nWhere gangsters and hustlers\nWhere they meet on 125C\nShe can never be yours, a housewife. you see\nShe belongs to the ghetto, my friend\nShe doesn't belong to you or me\"\nDid she find, did she find...\n\nL.E.S. Ezra: \"Let me tell you something about that song. It could go two ways. It could be about drugs, and it could be about a woman.\"", "title": "Thug Love Story 2017: The Musical (Interlude)", "album": "Mr. Wonderful", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3f40c65495de257e6acc2dabe3749b6b.800x800x1.jpg", "year": "2015-03-23"}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
