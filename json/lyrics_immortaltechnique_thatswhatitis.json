Bring it to 'em raw)\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nI told you what it was, but this is what it is now\n50 caliber bullets, I don't need a clip now\nFuck your private jet nigga we shooting the shit down\nBomb wall street and make the stock market dip down\nI told you what it was, but this is what it is now\nYou the shit nigga? I don't care about shit now\nI play the role of Abraham, idols get ripped down\nMelt the ice caps, and make all of this shit drown\n\n(No one out there can fuck with me)\n(motherfucka what?)\n(I speak that real shit)\n(to smash the airwaves)\n(I don't want to tell you motherfuckers again)\n\n[Outro]\n{Deep Cover-1992}\n\n[David Jason]\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed a new product.
