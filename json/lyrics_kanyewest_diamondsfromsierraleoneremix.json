Forever ever? Ever ever?\nEver ever? Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever?)\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nGood mornin', this ain't Vietnam still\nPeople lose hands, legs, arms, for real\nLittle was known of Sierra Leone\nAnd how it connect to the diamonds we own\nWhen I speak of diamonds in this song\nI ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin'\nI'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home\nMy chain, these ain't conflict diamonds\nIs they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, man\nSee, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'\nHow when I know what a blood diamond is?\nThough it's thousands of miles away\nSierra Leone connects to what we go through today\nOver here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs\nOver there they die from what we buy from drugs\nThe diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses\nI thought my Jesus piece was so harmless\n'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless\nAnd here's the conflict\nIt's in a black person soul to rock that gold\nSpend your whole life tryin' to get that ice\nOn a Polo rugby, it looks so nice\nHow can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?\nRight? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike\nYou can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight, 'cause\n\n[Hook: Kanye West & Shirley Bassey sample]\n(Diamonds are forever forever forever)\nThrow your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe\nDiamonds are forever forever forever\nThe Roc is still alive every time I rhyme\n(Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever ever?\nEver ever? Ever ever? Ever ever? Ever ever?)\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nPeople askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back\nThat'll be the same day I give the game back\nYou know the next question, dawg, \"Yo, where Dame at?\"\nThis track the Indian dance that bring our rain back\n\"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?\"\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nYup, I got it from here, 'Ye, damn\nThe chain remains, the gang is intact\nThe name is mine, I'll take blame for that\nThe pressure's on, but guess who ain't gonna crack?\nHa ha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that\nHow could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?\nI had to get off the boat so I could walk on water\nThis ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me\nDifficult takes a day, impossible takes a week\nI do this in my sleep\nI sold kilos of coke, I'm guessin' I can sell CD's\nI'm not a businessman; I'm a business, man!\nLet me handle my business, damn\nKanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy\nYG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me\nBleek could be one hit away his whole career\nAs long as I'm alive he's a millionaire\nAnd even if I die he's in my will somewhere\nSo he could just kick back and chill somewhere\nOh yeah, he don't even have to write rhymes\nThe Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes\nShirley Bassey's in the rear\nSayin' exactly what I've been sayin' practically my whole career\nThe diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever\nNow the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better\nPeople lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'\nInstead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix\nIf you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign\nIt would seem like forever is a mighty long time\n(I'm Young, bitches!) Good night!"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
