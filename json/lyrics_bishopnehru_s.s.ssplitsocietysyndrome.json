Believe or Doctors?\nNeed no roster, anyone can make it to the list\nThis society\u2019ll kill you and act like you don\u2019t exist\nIt's nothing, this sick crew don't walk around with fists\nBut if you diss sooner or later you gonna get hit like this\n\n[Hook]\nThey tell us to respect all the laws , they tell us all to listen to\nThe boss at what cost, the worlds still hectic. Nobodies protected\nOur own people fighting each other to see who\u2019s \u201cbestest\u201d This worlds\nIgnorant, nobody thinks. They too busy blowing L\u2019s and pouring a drink\nNo time to grind but still time to grind. When your friends say\nLets dip you leave in no time Quit lying\n\n[Verse 2]\nTrying to do right in this world but right isn\u2019t enough\nWe all fight in this world we living but got it rough\nSo I gotta take a puff a Haze, to better my daze\nWe live in a maze , and getting cheddars one of the ways\nThat I could keep an eye out for people hating\nI doubt that it\u2019ll change the way that they live\nThey still want two in my ribs cause im doing it big\nAnd all this envy causing frenzies\nCause I ain\u2019t acting too friendly\nKnow that knowledge is plenty\nYou\u2019d never die for a penny?\nNor would you dive for a penny\nDon\u2019t say that dollars will win the world\nThe most you get is a girl who loves you cause of the pearls\nThat you put around her neck\nThe life You live is a wreck\nIts time to check yourself, or infect yourself\nAnd keep your wealth stealth and protect your health\nBecause this society\u2019ll change entirely and it's strange\nBecause others gain as soon as your brains\nStrained as soon as pain is obtained"}], "artist": "Bishop Nehru"}
