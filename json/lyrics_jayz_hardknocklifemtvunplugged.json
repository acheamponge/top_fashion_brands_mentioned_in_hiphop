Nuh uh\nWhere all my brother with the rubber grips, bust shots\nAnd if you with me mama rub on your hips, and what-not\nI'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not\nLet outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot\nLet's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh\nLet's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh\nAnd sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy\nFlow infinitely like the memory of the homie Biggie, baby!\nYou know it's hell when I come through\nThe life and times of Shawn Carter, y'all Volume 2, y'all niggas get ready\nSing!\n\n[Hook: Jaguar Wright (Jay Z)]\nIt's the hard knock life for us\nIt's the hard knock life for us!\n(I can't hear y'all)\nInstead of treated, we get tricked\nInstead of kisses, we get kicked\nIt's the hard knock life!", "title": "Hard Knock Life (MTV Unplugged)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a7449b38b8eab47232b379bc442a5f10.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2001-12-18", "album": "MTV Unplugged"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
