A rusty 22 kid?\nThen he flipped quick, bust back from four-fifths\nSix fire, four hit, one crushed the pelvis\nThe others went through his wrist\nHow's that for accurate?\nThe kid's scarred for life\nEquipped with a permanent limp\nHe was ill when he was young, trying to raise his son\nEvery time beef come he blast the Mac one-one\nSpending two G's on cloth to impress the hoes\nGetting money in Milwaukee with a house on the low\nHe played the Five Boroughs, everyday fly\nThought he couldn't die\nBags of hydro in the 5, getting high\nHe had a rep for hijacking, extortion and kidnapping\nShooting up clubs, airport drug trafficking\nHe met his match, fuck around and rob the wrong cat\nFor a hundred and eighty Gs the God want his cream back\nNow it's a gun battle, but the son ain't fessing\nHe grabbed his Wesson\nThese niggas looking for me I'ma shoot their ass a lesson\nGoing all out, kill or be killed, what's done is done\nThese niggas not stopping me from having my fun\nHe at the tunnel, flexing his whip, rims dipped\nHad to much Courvoisier so he started to slip\nOh Shit! Their go them niggas that I stuck that black truck\nGive a fuck they want their cream, I'ma let my gat bust\nLet his shells fly, the God got hit twice he wounded\nThe liquor started talking didn't know what he was doing\nHe crashed the whip, jumped out ran to Sixth\nFlagged a cab, \"yo take me to Madison Ave\"\nHe did too much to live, and too much to turn back\nLay bleeding, wondering why it had to end like that\n\"Nobody's left, the world just me and myself\"\nIn back of the cab, son bled to death\nIt's fucked up, he was a good nigga...\n\n[Interlude]\nWord up.. the street stories.. know what I'm saying\nWord up, with the inner-city kids... yeah\n\n[Chorus] (x2)\nYoung wild niggas living street life on the edge\nNot knowing if tomorrow they could turn up dead\nYo fuck regular cops niggas get scoped by the Feds\nThe ghetto live in bloodshed (yo), we live in bloodshed\n\n[Outro]\nAnd we die in bloodshed, word up\nWe born to the paradise so respect your life, word up\nBlack man move on, word up\nHeadstrong, to the knotty one\nMen on lock down, word up\nGun Rule, the BX, BK, know what I'm saying, Shaolin\nWord up, Queens niggas, word up"}], "artist": "La The Darkman"}
