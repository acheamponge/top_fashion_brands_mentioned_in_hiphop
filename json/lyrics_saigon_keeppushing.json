Boy, do I hate \u2018em\u2014fuck a perpetrator\nHater, record label slave trader\nMy story the recipe of a grown man\nHad to go put my destiny in my own hands\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2 - Saigon]\nI ain\u2019t emerged to tell you how I splurge on the birds\nI don\u2019t give 'emnothing but word and still hit the curves\nThen swerve to another nerve\u2014murder superb\nThey heard of Giddy like they heard of the word\n33 and a third of what I spit\u2014this verbally is absurd\nNever 33 and a third.  It\u2019s addictive as herb, you heard?\nCome try and punk a nigga\nI run you over, hit your head with the bumper sticker\nIt's gon' take a month to fix you\nI'm being sincere when I say that you\u2019ll be in intensive care\nI don\u2019t think you really wanna visit there\nFlow water, words float like a motor boat\nBeen there and done it, dummy; I know the ropes\u2014quote, unquote\nFront on me, I go for broke.  Smoke with me, it\u2019s tote for tote\nJoke with me, I\u2019m funny as Kevin Hart making Oprah jokes\nOops I told joke twice, but that\u2019s aight\nThese motherfuckers know that I\u2019m nice\n\n[Hook]", "album": "The Greatest Story Never Told 2: Bread And Circuses"}], "artist": "Saigon"}
