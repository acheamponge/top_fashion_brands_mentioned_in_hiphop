Oh, oh, and you see a mountain\nA-a, a big, big, big, big mountain\nW-w-with a line that goes on forever and ever\nAnd, a-and a circle that looks like something very, very, uh... tippy top!\nAnd then you get in the back of the line and you start waiting and waiting and waiting\nAnd then you wait some more, and more, and more, and more\nAnd more, and more\nThen you get closer, and closer, and closer\nUntil you're next in line\nWhen it's finally your turn\nYou wake up from your dream because God isn't fucking real", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b77211ed800701c5cc8dc9a5a6ec95fa.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Is He Real?", "year": "2019-09-04"}]}
