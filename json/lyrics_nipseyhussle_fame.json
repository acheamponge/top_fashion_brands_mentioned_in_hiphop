Tell me one name\nAnd ask him if he came from dope spots and gunplay\nFinally off the runway, damn it feel good to spend a thousand on my son's shades\nLook, with street smarts who I dumb paid\nSeen the brake lights, I had to swerve off the runway\nUh, I knew that I would make it one day\nKnow I gotta be a real nigga 'cause I'm unphased\nI got a Beamer with a whole lot of trunk space\n[?] fuck face actin' mad 'cause he unpaid\nAnd I been out here since a young age\nI never been the type to complain\nI'ma let my gun bang\nBy any means to make my funds raise\nI'm on this money marathon, nigga, so I run things\nCheck out this status that I obtained\nIt's ten racks and four tickets if you want me at your club, mane\nAnd in the scheme of things, that's chump change\nWhen you doin' ten a month and savin' up when you done things\nI Crip hard and get love from the Blood gang\nBlue Chucks on the Red Carpet like, \"Fuck fame\""}], "artist": "Nipsey Hussle"}
