I don't know, maybe\nand you already know I mean, and you know I mean no harm\nI'm not like these other guys, I'm a lil different\nand I'm desperately trying to get you to think about me as much as I think about you , I just want you to notice me\nI have no problem admitting that not even Marilyn Monroe\nWho Cleopatra? Not even Joan of Ark, that don't mean nothing to me\nI just want a different girl, and that's you\n\nLove Pharrell", "year": "2014-05-15"}]}
