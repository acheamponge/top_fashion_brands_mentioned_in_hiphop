Haha\nBut the thing is, AMG we signed another deal today\nSkateboard P\nSo tomorrow is gon' be great\n\n[Verse 1]\nYo\nMe and a few shorties\nLanded on a tour met Paris Hilton right before me\nLong Beach, where skinny niggas carry strong heat\nAnd take giant steps like King Kong's feet\n\n[Break]\nIt's Gangsta Grillz ya bastards\n\n[Verse 1]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm in the 'Burban, the window's down I'm feelin' fervent\nWhere palm trees and trash clash, I'm so observant\nGot my connections to I-C-E\nSo no matter what sets we on it's like TV\nThe, bitches got hay fever\nTheir face turn red because they say \"Hi\" with their eyes, but I'm not a hay reader\nThis ain't a game and there ain't no play meter\nI can read her mind and, it says \"Feed her\"\nWe go to Matsuhisa's where it ain't a lot of people\nWhere they look at your watch, and proper they will treat you\nMe and my niggas toast we seen the best of the boats\nNext year in Aspen, we gon' ski the rest of the slopes\nMind your business that's just a note\nAnd don't be flexin' your coat 'less you expect to flow\nThat ain't no threat, and it's less than a joke\nThese niggas mark men marksmen professional\nThe fumble jungle where baking soda dressed to coke\nAnd uphill addicts watch their skin just float\nHuh, but today was a good day\n\n[Verse 3]\nIn my chain I got the pink Laffy Taffy\nThe white Laffy Taffy\nThe blue Laffy Taffy the yellow is so flashy\nBut it wasn't always like this exactly\nNiggas laughed at me the bitches treated me nasty\nI was a backpacker, now the gat-grabber\nThe only elevation seemed like the crack ladder\nBut then I heard Del, and the Hieroglyphics\nAnd The Pharcyde and the Tribe \"Can I Kick\" shit\nGot my backpack, started raisin' my knees\nStompin' in place while my niggas makin' G's\nRapping to myself man even making beats\nAnd the milli's keep my chilly man I keep makin' heat\nI'm like a vato you ain't takin' shit\nAnd since I was about 9 I've been skatin' please\nNow I'm in the hills with some US Magazine ho\nTellin' me to call her on ICECREAMs her dream clothes\nGame like a tendril, money like a spin wheel\nAnd retarded is my pencil don't give the nigga one inch he'll\nGo yard, I rock Goyard, \"What's that?\" Oh god\nI deal with LV but that's so hard\nBut I stick with LV cause I get it no charge\n\n[Outro]\nBBCICECREAM.com\nYessir", "year": "2006-04-04"}]}
