Thompson\nI'm on a bender, like a tiny gray antenna\nFuturama baby but my tiny lame dilemma\nIs that my energy is like a shot of five hour\nSo I guess that technically it makes me WHITE POWER\nI devour every doubter I encounter catch a coward and I sit him on the counter\nAnd I fix his little cowlick and I work with him to try to be a\nWay less sucky new productive member of society\nCause there's no rivalry\nI'm taking a page of the Patriots playbook and making a dynasty\nAnd you could be singing the national anthem as if it's a minor key\nI'll give you the win and I promise that I'll even throw in a tune up\nI'm doing it moving I'm loving the music I'm looking for truth\nI've been rocking a decade and if I get lucky I'll rock it at seventy\nIf I'm alive I'll be, a fucking sight to see", "image": "https://images.genius.com/15e329cac8808712e9bcdedd4c1b05fd.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": null, "title": "Duke Westlake Cypher"}]}
