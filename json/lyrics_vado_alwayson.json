I am always strong\nEven when I am always wrong I am always on\nGo hard you will be always on\nGo hard you will be always known\n... everybody clap for him\n... everybody clap for him\n\nThey say I ain't great wore more and less I ain't...\nReaching my goals to the... fear nothing trust life\nWhenever I mission you came right... can't take it\nI am tired on my way to word... jump high I got higher\n... on it's way to the bench team...\n... how did they react to them\nI am always on stand...
