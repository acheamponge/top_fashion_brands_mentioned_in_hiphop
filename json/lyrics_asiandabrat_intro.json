Rocked!\nYeah bitch!\nFuck going on?\nYeah Bitch!\n\n[Verse 2]\nGucci the heels and it cover my body\nRolling out pills, I might pass you a Molly\nFreaky lil' bitch, she the life of the party\nYou ain't got money, you fucking for nothing\nHop on my wave, you just follow instructions\nAss in Versace, can't sit on your cushion\nBreaking down bails, smoke a P without choking\nAim in his mouth like I'm striking for bowling\n\n[Hook]\nThis is Kill Bill! Uh!\nThis is Kill Bill! Uh!\nThis is Kill Bill! Uh!\nI am Kill Bill! Uh!\nYeah!\n\n[Post-Hook]\nNigga wanna fuck me, need a hundred bands make it double\nI don't understand then!
