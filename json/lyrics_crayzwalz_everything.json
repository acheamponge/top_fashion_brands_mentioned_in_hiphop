You better duck when the speakers pop\nFor those who love Biggie and Pac\u2014hip hop!\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nYo, cash rules everything \u2018cept these poison themes\nCaught between Cannibal Ox and Soylent Green\n\u2018Til I\u2019m Back to the Future with Biff, getting a facelift\nFrom Mrs. McFly, turning my whip to a spaceship\nI\u2019mma stand over y\u2019all \u2018til I\u2019m understood\nSo smooth, Krushing your Groove like Blair Underwood\nIn the heat of the night with a candle and chalice\nSmoking the Rafiki wearing Indian fabrics\nSinister sleepy.  Compete me indiscreetly\nI put sixteen shots in your dashiki\nSnatch ya Africa beads plus ya colon\nWriting fat rhyme\u2014lines leave your notebook swollen\nI\u2019m holding my nuts, dictating my seminar\nSimile-shoot razor blade shards, leave your lips scarred, mouth ajar\nNow before I come off, you need inspection\nIndeed, the section\u2019s adding your face to my survivor collection\nYou ain\u2019t hot \u2018cause you got a yacht\nMan, you got kids but you ain\u2019t no pops (Stop, stop)\nYou probably snow but you can\u2019t rock\n\u201cWith that freestyle, you\u2019re bound to get shot\u201d - Notorious B.I.G. on Craig Mack's \"Flava in Ya Ear (Remix)\"\n\n[Hook Two: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nHate crime.  Anxiety\nWaste time or flame the fire in me\nWhatever you learn, there\u2019s cheddar to earn\nIn the streets, this heat is better to burn (Whoo!)\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nWhen I was short on sums, I want none of your funds\nWhen I was young, I was numb, running with guns\nAnd I only went to class for the ass and the fun\n\u201cThe school dropout.  Never liked the shit from day one\u201d - Nas's \"Represent\"\nSome still backpacking a MAC, tracking a gat\nClapping rap cats slacking in facts, stacking\nAnd cats saggy with wack khakis like in the Black Dragon\nStabbing a cabin, bragging in Japanese patterns\nWild card cats in the same outfit follow suit\nDo the Hollywood Shuffle, guzzle hollow truth\nNow the time\u2019s right to shine light on Apollo\u2019s youth\nStrange fruit, juice, and trees\u2014saw tomorrow\u2019s loot\nThrough the era where those who touched the mic were very dope\nKids got shot were it very cold on a ferry boat\nTalking like we carry coke\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t worry, loc\u201d\nYour burial close\u2014next to your notebook.  Woah!\nSo keep keeping it up \u2018cause if you sleep\nYou ain\u2019t sleeping enough \u2018til you six feet deep in the dust\nI roll with sick minds, sniff lines, click .9s, switch rhymes\nBefore I bang on your team like I\u2019m 6\u20199\u201d\n\n[Hook One: C-Rayz Walz]\nI told y\u2019all I can\u2019t be stopped\nMy rhymes do more than circle the block\nI balance the scales.  You better duck when the speakers pop\nFor those who love Biggie and Pac\u2014hip hop!\n\n[Hook Two: C-Rayz Walz]\nHate crime, anxiety\nWaste time or flame the fire in me\nWhatever you learn, there\u2019s cheddar to earn\nIn the streets, this heat is better to burn (Whoo!)\n\n[Outro: Bridge and Samples with Scratches]\n[Bridge]\nEverything I wanted was all I need\nLove in me \u2018long as I\u2019m loving the streets\n[Samples with Scratches]\n\u201cYou know the rules\u201d - KRS-One on Boogie Down Productions' \"Ya Know the Rules\"\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all for life?\u201d - [?]"}]}
