(Man, who the fuck is this?)\nI don't know, no\nWhat you do? (Hmm, what?)\nI don't know, no\nYou short a few? (Oh, don't make me have to lose it)\nOh no, no, hold up\nPull my sticky out the jar, come on\n\n[Verse 1]\nOoh savage, that's a nice get-up\nInternational, rocking Japanese denim\nEnough gas to get you above average\nHow many more drags do I have to puff from my cigar?\nNew enemies, they bringing my old ways back\nBack in my day, woulda had your whole face smacked\nLook at you niggas, wonder why I fucking hate rap\nOoh, what make you wanna go and say that? (You)\nAnd I'm on another wave, and I'm puttin' on suede\nNiggas feeling overpaid, fuck I'm 'posed to do? (Do)\nDon't nobody know your name, we ain't ever seen ya face\nYou ain't ever gang-bang, what you tryna prove?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI never want it to ever be over (Over)\nI'm out in Philly, I thought it'd be colder (Colder)\nDrunk off the liqui, I might need a chauffeur (Chauffeur)\nCheck out my jiggy, check out my, uh\n\n[Chorus]\nNow, who are you? (Ooh, nigga)\nI don't know, no\nWhat you do? (Ooh, nigga)\nI don't know, no\nYou short a few? (Ooh, nigga)\nOh no, no, hold up\nPull my sticky out the jar, come on\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've been swimming through the process\nAnd you can't see me, I'm the Loch Ness\nYou could proceed, but with caution\nGive the proceeds to my god-kids\nOld dirt on my conscience\nSame nigga my pop is\nLame niggas wanna pop shit\nGet dropped quick by a drop kick\nWhy you gotta lie to me so much, babe?\nYou tell me the same shit that you told what's-his-name\nIf it don't work out, I'll go back to hustling\nCouple hundred-thousand up in my mother's name, peace\nWorld peace, niggas talk about \"Don't shoot\"\nTell that to police, mmm\nScared, ain't none of them prepared, I could see\nPromise I'ma get them commas before I decease\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI never want it to ever be over (Over)\nI'm out in Philly, I thought it'd be colder (Colder)\nDrunk off the liqui, I might need a chauffeur (Chauffeur)\nCheck out my jiggy, check out my, uh\n\n[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & Dr. Dre]\nNow, who are you? (Man, who the fuck is this?)\nI don't know, no\nWhat you do? (Ooh, nigga)\nI don't know, no\nYou short a few? (Ooh, nigga)\nOh no, no, hold up\nPull my sticky out the jar, come on\nNow, who are you? (Whoa, nigga)\nI don't know, no\nWhat you do? (Whoa, nigga)\nI don't know, no\nYou short a few? (Whoa, nigga)\nOh no, no\n\n[Outro: Dr. Dre]\nHey, AP, let it ride out"}]}
