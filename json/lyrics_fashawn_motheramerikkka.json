I heard they get found son\nWhen his noodle\u2019s hanging outside of his dome\nMama gotta pay for the funeral, need a loan\nShe\u2019ll be lucky if his murder even make the news\nI feel a pain like Billy when she sang the blues\n\u2018Bout the strangest fruit, have to have a bite\nBlame America for my appetite\nI even heard the new KKK is Kim, Kylie, and Kanye\nMother Amerikkka\n\n[Hook]\nTell me how could you take my smile away from me\nYou said you love me, but you lie, you lie, you lie\nTell me how could you take my smile away from me\nYou said you love me, but you lie, you lie, you lie\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo Lady Liberty got a pentagram in her vagina\nEver seen a tommy gun in the hands of a minor?\nEver seen a cop grab his cannon and fire\nAt somebody unarmed? A brother bodily harmed\nFeel like I don\u2019t belong, I want eye on the law\nThinkin\u2019 if they kill us one by one\u2014problem resolved\nI might get Willie Lynch\u2019d for this rhyme\nA pinch with some time, my face on a picket sign\nA nation on fire while money\u2019s the messiah\nEven treat they own presidents like pariahs\nWish it was simply black and white, no Mariah\nIn the USA the hue is Freddie Gray\nConfusion infused with the ignorance\nI wonder if I\u2019m a citizen or an immigrant\nThey have the nerve to call my family illegal\nWe all spinnin\u2019 on the axis of evil\nMother Amerikkka\n\n[Hook]\nTell me how could you take my smile away from me\nYou said you love me, but you lie, you lie, you lie\nTell me how could you take my smile away from me\nYou said you love me, but you lie, you lie, you lie\n\n[Verse 3]\nNo justice for Alton Sterling or Bettie Jones\nMiguel Espinal, Nathaniel Picket, Philando\nThat\u2019s the taste of a Bland decision\nAbulances, families panic-stricken\nLie in a casket or you could land in prison\nThat ultimatum still stands in the land we live in\nAll it took was a few grams, got my man convicted\nIt\u2019s harder being Dante than being Darren Wilson\nSo N-O-T-O-R-I-O-U-S in the U.S\nShe down, blow\nIn debt, confess we owe each other a lot\nStill I hug her like she the only mother I got\nEven though she threw shade on the sunniest spots\nTurned every one of her sons into something they not\nI been insane since I came out her stomach\nI don\u2019t know how else to say I\u2019m in love with Mother Amerikkka\n\n[Hook]\nTell me how could you take my smile away from me\nYou said you love me, but you lie, you lie, you lie\nTell me how could you take my smile away from me\nYou said you love me, but you lie, you lie, you lie", "title": "Mother Amerikkka"}]}
