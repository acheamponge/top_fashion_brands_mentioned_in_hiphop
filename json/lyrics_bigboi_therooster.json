Somebody done told you wrong!\n\n[Verse One:]\nOk, I start out all alone\n`Cause my baby mama left me\nNow there's nobody at home\nBeginning to feel like Ms. Jackson done got cloned\nWell it's some real shit and I'm living it through this song\nA moving vehicle took my family\nAs I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room\nI woke up very upset\nI throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies\nMy daughter, my baby, my baby mama all escaping me\nIn the wind, she was my friend\nLike Princess Di before she died, therefore we tried and tried again\nBut in the end you pay attention to the pluses\nBut the minuses behind make it seem like you can't win\n\n[Hook x4]\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\n\n[Verse Two:]\nRound two, a single parent, what is Big to do?\nThrow a parrty? Not hardly; I'm trying to stay up outta that womb\nOr that p-u-s-s uss, I said uss\nLuther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed\nSmashed, pushed to the limit, Smash and turned it timid\nHell everyone was suffering, the house was feeling wicked\nThe cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold\nBoth of our tempers were on swolle\nFor the most, part you fuss, fight, fart\nYou build it up to break it down and now take it from the start\nRepeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash\nOf two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the sign\n\n[Hook x4]\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\n\n[Verse 3:]\nK-O, knocked out by technicality\nThe love has kissed the canvas, now the whole family is mad at me\nMy daughter don't want me at her PTA meetings\nAnd then my son, he can't talk, when I change him he's peeing\nI think he's pissed, I can't dismiss the matter of the fact\nBecause he saw you and me argue, now the energy is coming back\nSet an example, a positive pattern, keep life on track\nBut I'm married to the music and committed to the wax, tapes and CDs\n\n[Bridge]\nTapes, CD's, Baby please, you make me want to scream\nYou're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?\nTapes, CD's, Baby please, you make me want to scream\nYou're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?\n\n[Hook x4]\nThrow your neck out\nThrow your back out\n\n[Bridge]\nTapes, CD's, Baby please, you make me want to scream\nYou're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?\nWax, tapes, CD's, Baby please, you make me want to scream\nYou're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/547d6239cd014bda1acb0078d0ddaafc.999x999x1.jpg", "year": "2003-09-23", "title": "The Rooster", "album": "Speakerboxxx"}]}
