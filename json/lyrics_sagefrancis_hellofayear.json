My head trapped in dear lights\nYou can call me John, I'm writing letters to the dark side of the moon tonight\nMy lovely Jane, you went away but the pain stayed\nSo I'm sending you a package to the address where we traded names\nI made no claims on the identity theft\nI'm more concerned about the home with no amenities left\nAnd it's already a mess. The dust piles like your junk mail\nSo I eat away depression and crush the scale\nYou find yourself on the opposite side of the spectrum\nEmaciated on a strict diet of bed crumbs\nMe? I choose to wallow and swim in my fat\nYou...refuse to swallow so I see ribs from the back\nThis isn't an attack, it's an admission of guilt\nI'm living in the past, kissing your ass, sipping your milk\nBut it's all bone and curdle. I saw stones in a circle\nStood in the middle. Told myself riddles in a robe that's purple\nThe murder weapon was an icicle\nIs that the reason why I'm standing in this puddle with my eyes so full?\nI fight feelings like a war on drugs\nI'm a chemist with a test tube addiction born through coffee mugs\nOur baby now is all growed up\nYour car is still dead in my driveway while I wait for the tow truck\nAnd you know what? I know I drove you away\nI still don't think it was wrong so I don't know what to say\nIt's been a tough year. You say that life ain't fair\nWell, guess what, baby...life ain't. Thems the breaks\nYou say that life ain't worth it. But it is. You gotta work it\nNobody's life is perfect\n\nYeah, you've been dealt a bad hand. Placed against a stacked deck\nBeen through all the cat scans and bad checks\nBut I slashed your debt. Not your wrists\nAnd I couldn't help with anything else that became cancerous\nHalfway people with a full baby to bury\nTook a flame to the papier-mache sanctuary\nWhen the smoke clears...try not to stare into the light\nBut, also, don't stay in the dark as if that's what life is like\nIt's just a series of unfortunate events\nBut the messages we get are more important than death\nWhat's the rush?\nI've got a shortness of breath\nWhat's the rush?\nRunning from you...running from me\nIt's the rush. The crush. The lust. The love-trust\nSo what's the trouble? The busted bubble? The unjust?\nThat's just the way the cookie crumbles. It does suck\nBut suck it up. We're all looking, but nothing's enough\nUse each other as a crutch to clutch the shift-switches\nYou couldn't just adjust. You combusted and ripped pictures\nThis is why I'm not considered a saint?\nWell, guess what?......I ain't\n\nIt's been a hell of a year\nYou said that I ain't there, I ain't care, and life ain't fair\nIt's been a hell of a trip\nYou say my mind's unfit, I've been flip, and I ain't shit\nIt's been a hell of a life\nYou say that I ain't like the way I write and that ain't right\nIt's been a hell of an attempt\nYou say that I ain't meant for promises unkept\nWell, guess what, darlin..\nI'm a keep keep callin\nGuess what, darlin..\nI'm a keep keep callin", "album": "Human the Death Dance"}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
