Cole]It's ya nigga, deep thinker, big drinker\nLate night, with ya wife in ya crib sneaker\nWhen you out of town, and you not around\nTurn your ass over like a nigga stepped out of bounds\nCrowd around young'n\nI got ammo and a lot of rounds coming\nUp in the streets where you not allowed, runnin'\nGot the songs bitches ride around hummin'\nAnd the niggas stay thumpin'\nAnd the hater's hate pumpin'\nGot the 808\u2032s bumpin'\nSo the trunks stay thumpin'\nAnd the nigga get high only on occasion in\nMy mind too wild\nDamn thought weed supposed to calm you down\nBut I'm so high I can palm two clouds\nBoy look, these niggas quote my lines like the Lord's book\nYou niggas less rhymes more hooks\nMore bucks but less love\nYou hear them drums, ?uestlove\nNo Roots, I'm so truth\nI used to rock sidelines like a coat suit\nHad to look at all them loafers, yeah them boat shoes\nNow I'm in the game but I won't boast to you dummy\nRemember niggas had short jokes for my money\nToast to the honey's, money and the liquor\nAnd bitch I don't sound like any other nigga\nWith my finger on the trigger\nI burn rappers like Henny on the liver\nGrant death wishes like a genie I'ma killer\nLord giveth and he taketh like an Indian giver\nHard to keep jimmy in zipper\nWhen you got them bad Anne Vivians with ya\nRemy and weed, I got em on Pluto\nI like Henny but the hoes prefer Nuvo\n\n[Fashawn]\nCheck, every time a nigga roll\nOld school (?) and it's sittin on (?)\nHoes on me when I enter the door\nIf a nigga wanna trip, good grip on the chrome\nEmpty out a clip from the fifth then I'm gone\nTwist up a spliff, get a fifth of Patron\nHate a chick who just talk shit on the phone\n\nBaby I'm tryna stick, give ya dicks to ya dome, shit\nIf I was you nigga I would hate him\nHot August nights I'm out there in Vegas\nStuntin til time, had that patience\nNow it's big faces, fly vacations\nAlias Shawn stacks\nMiss shows, never call back\nBlowin' Dro sippin tall cats\nOn the low had to crawl back\nNiggas wonder if it's all raps\nOr it's all facts\n\n[Omen]As I step in the toe like Fe fi foe\nWith the heat like flow and the beat typo\nBetter rewrite yo, get your rhyming straight\nGet murked plus 8 like Jon and Kate\nI mean it's time for the face off\nHit the corner like an 8 ball\nMe not concentrate like adorf\nNo time for I had a get a day job\nMe on the mind you ain't even on the radar\nNever bring it but I never been a fiend for her silly ways\nSo I'm tryna get the cream til I'm silly paid\nCouldn't put her on the team, every week another reason\nThats fiend like Billy Mays\nGotta grind gotta focus\nGotta shine through the minds of the blind light the hopeless\nNever confined to the rhymes that I've chosen\nMoment of silence the Times gotta quote this!", "title": "Relaxation (clone page)"}]}
