(Did it by myself)\nSalute me or just shoot me? (Did it by myself)\nI don't need no help, got juice like Welch\nAll this pain that I felt, narcotics I dealt\nDid it by myself\nDid it by myself\nThis the last draw, so I gotta get it in\nLord, please help me, got my hands all in\nI promised to my momma that the streets won't win\nBrick Squad shawty, I'ma ride till the end\n\n[Hook: David Blayne & Waka Flocka Flame]\nI'm all I got (I'm all I got)\nI'm all I got (I'm all I got)\nI'm all I got (I'm all I got)\nI'm all I got (I'm all I got)\nI'm all I got (I'm all I got)\nI'm all I got (I'm all I got)\nI'm all I got (I'm all I got)\nI'm all I got (I'm all I got)\n\n[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]\nI know y'all hear this all the time, thoughts running through my mind\nHaters, keep them behind, don't let them block my grind\nGive a fuck about shining\nI said I give a fuck about shining\nEverywhere from the heart, Waka Flocka, where to start?\nI lost my little brother, we used to kick it like martial arts\nDaddy and my uncle died on the same day\nEver since then, hard work, no play\nWhere the fuck I stay? Clayton County, Riverdale\nMiddle finger to the twelve, give a fuck about jail\nI'ma try and bust bells and sell cocaine\nBut these niggas wanna tell, why the fuck they acting lame?\nStill the same nigga, hanging with the same clique\nClayco trying to ban me like Atlanta did Vick\nI don't give a fuck, shawty, I'ma stay on my shit\nLast time I checked, Waka Flocka Flame the shit\n\n[Hook: David Blayne & Waka Flocka Flame]\nI'm all I got (I'm all I got)\nI'm all I got (I'm all I got)\nI'm all I got (I'm all I got)\nI'm all I got (I'm all I got)\nI'm all I got (I'm all I got)\nI'm all I got (I'm all I got)\nI'm all I got (I'm all I got)\nI'm all I got (I'm all I got)\n\n[Outro: Waka Flocka Flame]\nRah Rah, man, you know...\nMan, you know that shit we was talking 'bout, nigga\nYou know, me and you, man\nI think, I think I'ma take the family up through there, man\nWe rich, man\nThis to my daddy to my uncle, man\nI love y'all, man\nGod bless the dead, man\nTravis Scott, man, I love you bro\nGod bless the dead, man\nStepdaddy Red, man\nDamn, fuck, Flocka", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a7f4cdca00f823e421f5447e42ad6de2.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "LeBron Flocka James", "title": "All I Got"}]}
