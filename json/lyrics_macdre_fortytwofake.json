She said when I knocked on the door\nI said it's young MD, oh, you ain't knowin'\nStepped inside and I could tell from a distance\nShe was burning scented candles and maybe even incense\nBoy, I tell ya, she was in the mood\nShe said, I hope you're hungry 'cause I cooked up some food\nShe lit the fireplace, threw on a love ballad\nBefore the main course we ate shrimps and salad\nWe talked for a while and drank Zinfandel\nShe had ass like ten games of big pin the tail\nOn the donkey\nChocolate, opposite from honky\nAll I can think about is hittin' that monkey\n\n(chorus)\n\n(verse 3)\nShe was diggin' your folks, boy I could tell\nHow she served fat steaks and big lobster tail\nOn the first visit, everything exquisite\nThe door bell rang, she didn't ask who is it\nShe must've knew dude, 'cause she gave him some cash\nHe kicked down a twomp sack and a fat gram of hash\nWe smashed, we turned joints to doobies\nShe eightysixed the music and pulled out three movies\nMahogany, The Mack, Baby Got Back\nShe said, I'll be right back, roll the rest of that sack\nI rolled the weed up, then I kicked my feet up\nThen two niggas came in with masks on, G'd up\nThe plot thickens, I'm slippin' like a muthafucka\nMopped and chopped and gettin' treated like a sucka\nFive minutes ago, I was finna fuck great\nBut now I'm gagged up, wrapped in duct tape\nThey choked me, broke me, and dropped me off on the bridge\nAnd all I can think about was killin' that bitch\nMy worst mistake, fuckin' with a snake\nHow a playa gonna fall for that Fortytwo Fake?\nThat Fortytwo Fake\n\n(chorus to end)", "year": "1999-09-28", "album": "Rapper Gone Bad", "title": "FortyTwo Fake"}], "artist": "Mac Dre"}
