Because he makin lots of dough\nMatter fact, buy fat clothes and lots of hoes\n(So you think that his lifestyle is fine?)\nNo, but I gotta get mine\nIf I was a comedian I'd make you laugh\nA fireman?  I'd blow away the backdraft\nI could be a point guard and leave you stuck\nI could be a cop, fools got no luck\nDig, I'm a kid, and I want wealth\n(Fuck what you heard - do fa self)\n\n[Chorus: reggae chatta + yelling children]\nWhenever the pressure gets ya dowwwn - \"I'MA DO FA SELF\"\nAnd alla ya friends are not ar-round - \"I'MA DO FA SELF\"\nFamily starts to doubt you - \"I'MA DO FA SELF\"\nDem never give a fuck about you - \"I'MA DO FA SELF\"\n\"I'MA DO FA SELF\"\n\"I'MA DO FA SELF\"\n\n[Apache]\nSex is the next subject, let's keep in mind\nI had my first piece of pussy when I was nine\nNobody told me the facts about Jim hats\nCouldn't keep me from goin I was hoin like it was all that\nThere's a valuable lesson here to be learned\nI was the man for a minute until Tonto got burned\nBefore you step up strap up for safe sex\nThe bitch that burned me I broke her fuckin neck\nI came apart and the hood didn't share a care\nA nigga's worst nightmare, and I didn't fight fair\nOne time my brother tried to play me to get paid\nShowed no shame, had more game than an arcade\n(Did you get him?) Got him (Shoot him?) Shot him\n(What is up with his family?) Yo I could care a fuckin less about 'em\nBut I pray that you stay in good health\nFuck what you heard - do fa self\n\n[Chorus: reggae chatta + yelling children]\nWhenever the pressure gets ya dowwwn - \"I'MA DO FA SELF\"\nAnd alla ya friends are not ar-round - \"I'MA DO FA SELF\"\nFamily starts to doubt you - \"I'MA DO FA SELF\"\nDem never give a fuck about you - \"I'MA DO FA SELF\"\n\"I'MA DO FA SELF\"\n\"I'MA DO FA SELF\"\n\"I'MA DO FA SELF\"\n\"I'MA DO FA SELF\"", "year": null}]}
