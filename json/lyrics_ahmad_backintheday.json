{"songs": [{"title": "Back in the Day", "lyrics": "[Hook]\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\n\n[Verse 1]\nI remember (back in the days)\nWhen I just a little niggarole\nI looked up to my bigger bro\nBegged if I could kick it so\nWhen he went out with girls I could go tagging along\nNagging if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat\nY'all remember way back then, when it was 1985\nAll the way live, I think I was about ten\nOne of those happy little niggas singing the blues\nThat be always trying to bag with the shag and karate shoes\nSayin \"Yo momma black; his momma this, his momma that\"\nThen he get mad and wanna scrap\nWe stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike\nTo play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungalows\nThen switch to playing ding dong ditch, when that gets\nOld and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket\nYou could tell the ballers cuz they bell wearing Gazelles\nAnd if they really had money raised be sporting BK's\nAnd, all the girls had they turkish link\nIf it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it\nBut, sometimes, I still sit and reminisce\nThen, think about the years I was raised, back in the days\n\n[Hook]\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\n\n[Reprise]\nAnd everybody say (I remember way back when)\nAnd everybody say (I remember way back when)\nAnd everybody say (I remember way back when)\nWhat? (back in the day) When? (back in the day)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87\n'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high\nIn 7th grade, I hated school (wish it'd blown up)\nNo doubt I couldn't wait to get out (and be a grownup)\nBut let me finish this reminiscing and telling\n'Bout when girls was belling tight corduroys like for the boys\nBasket weaves, Nike Cortez, and footsie socks\nAnd eating pickles, with tootsie pops\nAnd it don't stop, I'm glad cause when J.J. Fad hit\nSupersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts\nOr to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses\nOf hoochies had Poison airbrushed on they asses\nDudes had on Nike suits, and the Pumas with\nThe fat laces cause it was either that or K-Swiss\nI miss those days and so I pout like a grown jerk\nWishing all I had to do now, was finish homework\nIt's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone\nAnd I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but\nSometimes I do sit and reminisce then\nThink about the years I was raised, back in the days\n\n[Hook]\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\n\n[Reprise]\nAnd everybody say (I remember way back when)\nAnd everybody say (I remember way back when)\nAnd everybody say (I remember way back when)\nWhat? (back in the day) When? (back in the day)\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, it's the niggarole, I figure that now I'm all grown up\nBecause I'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say I'm holding\nDown a steady job and crew steady mobbing\nYou steady bobbing your head and I'm paid, so I got it made\nBut, didn't always have clout, used to live in South Central L.A\nThat's where I stayed and figured a way out\nI gave it all I had so for what it's worth\nI went from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first\nSo Ahmad and The Jones' is on our way up\nYup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid\nAnd we finally did, but\nSometimes I still sit and reminisce then\nThink about the years I was raised, back in the days\n\n[Hook]\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\n\n[Reprise]\nAnd everybody say (I remember way back when)\nAnd everybody say (I remember way back when)\nAnd everybody say (I remember way back when)\nWhat?
