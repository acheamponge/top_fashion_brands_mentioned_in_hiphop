Ain't it a Monday?\nFuck knows! May as well be a Sunday\nRunway when I take off 6 val's\nWhoops, straight lost six hours\nI'm back in effect\nGot shanked in my neck now I'm back from the dead\nBut adjusting has been hard\nLike I give a shit man? Chicks dig scars\nChicks dig me so I dig 'em out\nBut I keep 'em all, I never let 'em out\nGot about 16 in my cellar now\nYeah I still take bus but I get about\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Professor Green]\nThe bad boy's back boy\nOn road with my iPod on singing along to black boys\nThen skipping along to Take That\nSo take that, say what? I hate rap\nAin't that funny\nShitting on rappers like I ate that curry\nSo? So mind your business\nOr wind up with stitches, bitches\nDickless with your wanna-be bars\nImpotent rappers- all wanna be hard\nDiss me? You must wanna get parred\nFaux- par you're so 'barge\nAin't seen a rapper like me yet so far\nNah, I'm gonna take getting used to\nThe pupil nobody could get through to\nOn YouTube, in a tutu\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2010-07-16"}]}
