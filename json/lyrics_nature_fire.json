I play with any card you niggas deal me\nEvery nigga out the fam is guilty, I plead the fifth\nQueens niggas be the strength, the lock and chain\nThugs on the block know I got the game\nYou mighta heard me with The Firm and forgot my name, pardon me\nIt's N-A-T-U-R-E\nThe latest Barkley's, known to smack niggas nonchalantly\nQueensbridge, same hood as Nas and Mobb Deep\nGhettofabulous, class of nine-eight my fellow graduates\nWell known savages, we elbow cabbages\nNiggas better duck or I'ma spray a round\nI make it like the O.K. Corral, blazin 'til I lay 'em down\n\n[Chorus - repeat 2X]\nIf you need flames, you need this\nIf you resist, you need help\nThird degree burns, the heat felt\nBlaze when I know that it's on, what you thought it was a false alarm?\n\n[Nature]\nYo, yo, aiyyo\nI got more twists than Six Flags, more chicks than gym class\nOverweight momma sippin Slim Fast, glad to meet Nate\nThe casualty rate, risin like yeast\nAnd they label me surprise of the streets, Cobra Commander\nI smoke Newports, meanin I roll with cancer\nFuck what y'all thought, y'all know the answer, is psychological\nTone and Poke beats, make me write phenomenal\nI give lifetime scars like drama do, it's gangsta chronicles\nTurn to page one, hurricanes come, I call 'em twisters\nIt's deeper than life Dunn, I'm four dimensions\nMore suspensions, SV-12; gettin pressed my cassettes need shells\nFuckin Mets need help\nIt's therapeutic, I lay it out clear\nY'all niggas better use it\nNowhere else you find better music\nYou try to find it in the hall of fame\nMy man's callin shit fire, I just call it flame\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Nature]\nYo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo\nQueens to the heart from the start it was Run and them\nNo love faggot MC's respect none of them\nNiggas stop mumblin, get popped you're fumblin\nRegulatin raps to rocks the block's bubblin\nFive percent days, in the Bridge bobbin off calente\nWise enough to drop out the 10th grade\nHold that thought, twist up nigga, roll that short\nCatch me with my chick that let me go back door\nHall of famer, don't make me shoot your game up\nAt close range, stand back watch the toast flame\nYo it's funny, the way a nigga act like that\nIt's only money, that make a nigga rap like that\nKeep a roscoe, peep me on the Chris Rock show\nYou either beat me or you get your eye swoll, y'all know the rules\nFaggot niggas like y'all, chose to lose\nI give meaning to the phrase smoke'n'brew, fire nigga\n\n[Chorus] - repeat to fade"}], "artist": "Nature"}
