Maybe I should go\nMaybe I'm another that you need to let go\nSee one day if you let me I will try and mend this broken past\nYeah, my heart will save us cause I am never giving up on us\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo if you love me you shouldn't care if I've made mistakes\nCause if you need me you should have never pushed me away\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's like you've been waiting on a different me\nYou say it could get better but you'll never see\nCause I see\nThe beautiful me\nSo when it comes down to it\nI'll always have love for ya, love for ya\nWhen it comes down to it\nI'll always have love for ya, love for ya\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey say that I'm a liar cause I'm from an estate\nBut what you say behind my back you know I'll say it your face\nI wish we could let bygones be bygones and so on and fire on\nFor you I swear I'll catch another case\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo if you love me you shouldn't care if I've made mistakes\nCause if you need me you should have never pushed me away\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's like you've been waiting on a different me\nYou say it could get better but you'll never see\nCause I see\nThe beautiful me\nSo when it comes down to it\nI'll always have love for ya, love for ya\nWhen it comes down to it\nI'll always have love for ya, love for ya\n\n[Verse 3]\nI weren't brought up round money so I didn't know how to treat it\nI helped everyone round me and spent it all just when I needed it\nI made a mil' and splashed it, did it all again\nThis time round, can't even trust myself, let alone my friends\nIf I'm the man why they don't play me no more?\nThat can't be fair right?\nJust don't get it cause I'm on their side\nI wish they wore these Nikes, took a hike to see what it's like in my spare time\nAnd then come back and tell me that I deserve to lose all my air time\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's like you've been waiting on a different me\nYou say it could get better but you'll never see\nCause I see\nThe beautiful me\nSo when it comes down to it\nI'll always have love for ya, love for ya\nWhen it comes down to it\nI'll always have love for ya, love for ya\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's like you've been waiting on a different me\nYou say it could get better but you'll never see\nCause I see\nThe beautiful me\nSo when it comes down to it\nI'll always have love for ya, love for ya\nWhen it comes down to it\nI'll always have love for ya, love for ya", "year": "2015-01-28"}], "artist": "Dappy"}
