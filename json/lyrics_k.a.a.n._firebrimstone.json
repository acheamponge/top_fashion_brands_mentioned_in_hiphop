Huh\nWe're livin' in disparity\nAnd all I pray for is clarity\nTo find peace of mind yeah that's a rarity\nAnd I'm dropping knowledge but that's sparingly\nAnd that thought of death is not scaring me\nI said like a G you better bury me\nI said like a G you better bury me\nAnd when I'm dead and gone will you remember me\nAnd when I'm dead and gone will you remember me\nAnd on my grave pour a little bit of Hennessy\nI said I give a picture for this men to see\nAnd I'm suicidal don't envy me\nAnd I'm suicidal don't envy me\nAnd I'm suicidal don't envy me\nCrazy how his life came to a halt\nFrom the bullet that he caught\nHis younger brother had saw\nHe had died in his arms\nThey're ringin' him no alarm\nFor causin' a nigga harm\nConversation with his mom\nShe would try and keep him calm\nAnd tell him \"remain strong\"\nBut his brain gone off on a whole 'nother tangent\nCausin' a nigga pain for he has manifested\nThe hatred he held inside has now festered\nBubbled and boiled over\nTurnin' that kid colder\nLookin' for the motherfucker that took his older brother\nGot a pistol in the trunk\nWith the automatic pump\nTo blast on him and dump\nWhen he saw the nigga run\nHe would pull the trigger more\nThe body hittin' the floor\nThe gun let off a roar\nLike a Vietnam tour\nIt's the same old sound, from the same old war\nTwo black men dead, and what was it all for?\nThat's the same bullshit your favorite rapper would endorse\nThe hatred of one another and I'm givin' you the source\nThe genocide of a people that treat it like it's a sport\nAnd since they're currently on they're hardly keepin' afford\nI know I'm goin' to Hell, for the way I'm livin' is wrong\nMind, body and soul, and Fire and Brimstone\nMind, body and soul, and Fire and Brimstone\nMind. body and soul, and Fire and Brimstone"}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
