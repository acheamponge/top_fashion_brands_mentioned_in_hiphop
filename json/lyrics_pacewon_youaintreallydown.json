You'll need a forklift to help him up\nAll the king's horses and all the king's men\nLike me, they know the time like Big Ben\nKingpin at it again with a pad and a pen\nGet your gat and your vest and let's roll\nGet your hat and your coat and let's go\nLike Eddie Murphy, I run the \"Metro\"\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Pacewon]\nYo, shots on target, open up the market\nBomb your apartment, walk it like I bark it\nTake you in the crib with some sharp shit\nIf you drivin a car, you better park it\nI'm a star kid, women stalkin\nShe ain't fuckin?  Then I'm walkin\nGot a boyfriend?  Shoulda called him\nI'm on that tape you got playin in your Walkman\nRhymin, dinin, I shine on interviews\nI'm more fine and I rhyme more syllables\nIller with the rhyme and my time's more critical\nJust in my prime now I'm more physical\nKeep this hip-hop real like a cult\nMake this paper turn green like The Hulk\nThirsty niggas don't sip, we like to gulp\nAnd there's a couple of chicks out here I'd like to UHH\n\n[Hook]\n\n[ad libs of Hook to end]", "year": null}]}
