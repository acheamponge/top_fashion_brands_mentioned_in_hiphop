Are you ready? Yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't go missing, fly with me\nDon't go missing, fly with me, fly with me\nDon't go missing, fly with me\n(Check it out, check it out)\nDon't go missing, fly with me, fly with me\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nI'm aware that we just met\nI don't wanna leave you yet\nPromise that I won't forget\nI'm coming back, I'm coming back\nYes, I'll be there, oh, yes, I'll be there, oh\nAbout to board a flight, sitting at my gate\nI just wanna touch you but I'm so far away (I'm so)\nAll I wanna do is give you all of me now\nAre you ready? Are you ready? Oh\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't go missing, fly with me\nDon't go missing, fly with me, fly with me\nDon't go missing, fly with me\n(Check it out, check it out)\nDon't go missing, fly with me, fly with me, fly"}]}
