That's the word, yeah\n\n[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]\nCome closer\nAll I ever needed was some closure\nCome closer\nAll I ever needed was some\n\n[Verse 2: Queen Naija]\nYou told me that you need some closure, you said come over\nI don't need to take no Uber, I drive a Rover\nTryna bribe me with a bag, wait, nigga, hold up\nIf you ever try to play me, nigga, you's a whole dub, whole dub\nAlways got what I wanted\nNever asked nobody for nothin'\nI can take a trip to the islands alone\nBut if you want it you\nGotta come with somethin' new\nI don't know what's wrong with you\nSo over your petty games, you're getting way too comfortable\nOh-oh, oh\nGettin' real comfortable treatin' me like a regular\nDon't bring out the worst in me when I bring out the best in you\nBoy, I ain't average\nDon't make me turn savage\nI need you to see that I'm no regular girl\n\n[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie & Queen Naija]\nCome closer (Oh-oh, oh-whoa)\nAll I ever needed was some closure (Needed some closure)\nCome closer\nAll I ever needed was some closure (All I ever needed was some closure)\n\n[Outro: A Boogie wit da Hoodie & Queen Naija]\nCome closer, oh, oh (All I ever needed was some closure)\nCome closer, oh, oh\nAll he ever needed was some closure"}], "artist": "A Boogie Wit da Hoodie"}
