"lyrics": "[Intro]\nYou mean to tell me that this is not music\nI could fucks with this, I could fucks with this\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt's the mystic, materialistic misfit child of the imperial empress\nEver since birds flew, I been spitting this wittiness\nIt should be considered a sickness\nCan you blame him for making an engravement\nAnd leaving the game the same way that he came in\nSay that we came this far from cavemen\nHow hard could it be to spark fire with a drumstick\nIf the flows that I'm spitting are far-fetched\nIma' kick it regardless, they listen to nonsense\nDigressive korrupt recreation in progress\nNo question if they raise they arms yet\nSo tell me can you smell that funk?\nGot nothing but blunts and Mami with the junk in trunk\nProEra be the troublesome bunch\nAnd they gon' remember that name in a couple of months\nI got it locked on the indigo ribbon\nFeel the rhythm as it's swimming out your stereo system\nAnd Ima' keep on runnin' with it\nYea I got soul, I was brought up by colored women\n\n[Chorus]\nShouts-out to queens that was raised out in Brooklyn\nI remember I was on the outside looking in\nKeep a stash even when my pockets was looking thin\nSo pass the pot and let me skillet\nYou comprehend, Do you comprehend?\nI don't think they comprehend\nSaid Chicago's the game and I'm all for the win\nSo tell me if it's bongs or hemp\nShouts-out to queens that was raised out in Brooklyn\nI remember I was on the outside looking in\nKeep a stash even when my pockets was looking thin\nSo pass the pot and let me skillet\nYou comprehend, Do you comprehend?\nI don't think they comprehend\nSaid Chicago's the game and I'm all for the win\nSo tell me if it's bongs or hemp\n\n[Chorus]\nShouts-out to queens that was raised out in Brooklyn\nI remember I was on the outside looking in\nKeep a stash even when my pockets was looking thin\nSo pass the pot and let me skillet\nYou comprehend, Do you comprehend?\nI don't think they comprehend\nSaid Chicago's the game and I'm all for the win\nSo tell me if it's bongs or hemp\nShouts-out to queens that was raised out in Brooklyn\nI remember I was on the outside looking in\nKeep a stash even when my pockets was looking thin\nSo pass the pot and let me skillet\nYou comprehend, Do you comprehend?\nI don't think they comprehend\nSaid Chicago's the game and I'm all for the win\nSo tell me if it's bongs or hemp\nShouts-out to queens that was raised out in Brooklyn\nI remember I was on the outside looking in\nKeep a stash even when my pockets was looking thin\nSo pass the pot and let me skillet\nYou comprehend, Do you comprehend?\nI don't think they comprehend\nSaid Chicago's the game and I'm all for the win\nSo tell me if it's bongs or hemp\nShouts-out to queens that was raised out in Brooklyn\nI remember I was on the outside looking in\nKeep a stash even when my pockets was looking thin\nSo pass the pot and let me skillet\nYou comprehend, Do you comprehend?\nI don't think they comprehend\nSaid Chicago's the game and I'm all for the win\nSo tell me if it's bongs or hemp\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe jazzy ambiance keeps me right where I belong\nEver since infinity and beyond\nLyricism isn't appreciated in song\nAnd I won't dumb it down just to be business smart\nYour beats cool but it isn't from the heart\nAnd of course, your bars just don't require thought\nYou hear the lions roar every time I perform\nA Deviant, Defiant to the lies of the art\nMy goal is to try to bring light to the dark\nHigh voltage like lightning, I spark\nVanish, living in the eye of the storm\nIn a sense it's gone but my mind isn't lost\nIn reality, vanity is our sanity\nThen we lose sight when we're trapped in sanity\nThink about the two \"I's\" In Insanity\nAnd read between the lines, it's more to it actually\n\n[Chorus]\nShouts-out to queens that was raised out in Brooklyn\nI remember I was on the outside looking in\nKeep a stash even when my pockets was looking thin\nSo pass the pot and let me skillet\nYou comprehend, Do you comprehend?\nI don't think they comprehend\nSaid Chicago's the game and I'm all for the win\nSo tell me if it's bongs or hemp\nShouts-out to queens that was raised out in Brooklyn\nI remember I was on the outside looking in\nKeep a stash even when my pockets was looking thin\nSo pass the pot and let me skillet\nYou comprehend, Do you comprehend?\nI don't think they comprehend\nSaid Chicago's the game and I'm all for the win\nSo tell me if it's bongs or hemp\n\n[Chorus]\nShouts-out to queens that was raised out in Brooklyn\nI remember I was on the outside looking in\nKeep a stash even when my pockets was looking thin\nSo pass the pot and let me skillet\nYou comprehend, Do you comprehend?\nI don't think they comprehend\nSaid Chicago's the game and I'm all for the win\nSo tell me if it's bongs or hemp\nShouts-out to queens that was raised out in Brooklyn\nI remember I was on the outside looking in\nKeep a stash even when my pockets was looking thin\nSo pass the pot and let me skillet\nYou comprehend, Do you comprehend?\nI don't think they comprehend\nSaid Chicago's the game and I'm all for the win\nSo tell me if it's bongs or hemp\nShouts-out to queens that was raised out in Brooklyn\nI remember I was on the outside looking in\nKeep a stash even when my pockets was looking thin\nSo pass the pot and
