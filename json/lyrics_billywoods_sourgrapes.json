Tees and lit votive candles\nMotives random\nManicured and pampered you'll never understand it\nFor those who've been abandoned\nI'm speaking candid\nOverly anxious\nStress build fast it might strangle\nAll that glitters ain't gold gold but shit it dangle\nNo bank roll\nStill on tilt like a kangol\nBe thankful"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
