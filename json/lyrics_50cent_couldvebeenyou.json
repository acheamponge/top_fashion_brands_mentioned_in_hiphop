Kelly]\nSay, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, go\nThe reason you didn't get dick\nBecause you got your nose up your ass like your smelling your shit\nBut tonight you met your match\nCause I be smelling my shit too, now how you like that?\nYou could've had this dude and anything you choose\nAnd now girl you lose cause I ain't fucking with ya\n(Could've been you)\nShopping spree's, drop top hair blowing in the wind\n(Could've been you)\nLiving lavish, instead it's your girlfriend\nBut you tripping while we sipping\nIn the back of the club big tipping\n\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nShe say it hurts when you supposed to win then you lose\nYou were supposed to be sure, baby, you was confused\nI had a thing for you, I had a ring for you\nHouse, cars, kids and a pet name for you\nPussycat, told you I'd make it, you ain't believe\nI guess cause coming up was hard it was easy to leave\nNow think about it, maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong\nEither way shorty, life goes on\nWhen you around, my smile's a grin, my thoughts are a sin\nYou ask me can we try again, I ain't fucking with you\nIt's on, the club jumping, I'm trying get my liquor and\nYou wanna suck the dick again, I'm staring at your thicker friends\nI guess I'm like Will Smith in \"Pursuit of Happyness\"\nIn my hood, we all hustle and in pursuit of the same shit\nNow just think, just think, that could've been you\nNow just think that should've been you with me\nI share the world with you\nBut you ain't ride with a rider, so I ain't fucking with you\n\n[Hook: R.Kelly]\nSay, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, go\nThe reason you didn't get dick\nBecause you got your nose up your ass like your smelling your shit\nBut tonight you met your match\nCause I be smelling my shit too, now how you like that?\nYou could've had this dude and anything you choose\nAnd now girl you lose cause I ain't fucking with ya\n(Could've been you)\nShopping spree's, drop top hair blowing in the wind\n(Could've been you)\nLiving lavish, instead it's your girlfriend\nAnd it ain't no other way to put it except\nI know you understand it girl, it's so\nBut you see us in the back of the club\nPopping bottles and it could've been you, but nope\n\n[Outro: R.
