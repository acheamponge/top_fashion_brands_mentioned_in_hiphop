{"artist": "Big Daddy Kane", "songs": [{"lyrics": "Manslaughter, walkin' on water\nI stay afloat with a note, the way a boat oughta\nI'm too poetically inclined, one of a kind\nTrue and divine the genuine, breakin a bond and gettin mine\nSo freeze, I'm makin' it flow with ease\nAnd droppin' the funkiest lyrics that ever been known to MC's\nCause I can recite it fast, or even rap slow\nHuh, man I can just talk and my shit'll flow\nBecause I mastered the rhythms of winnin'\nLyric hit em, just the flow itself'll tell you that I did 'em\nSo let the K-to-the-A-to-the-N-to-the-E\nShow you the meaning of real harmony, as I float\n\nFloat.. float on\nFloat on.. float on.. (repeat 2X)\n\nPeep this\nI'm always on the down-low, smooth and mild\nBut when it's time to get wild, huh, you know my style\nI drop lyrics wham bam by the gram on a jam\nAnd goddddd DAMN!\nIt's like a disaster that nobody goes after\nRappers turn ghost like Casper\nCause battlin' me, you'd only meet your fate\nYou'd probably come out better tryin to fight in Kuwait\nTo be smart, would be not to start\nNot even The Wiz can give you that much heart\nRap is like an art, and man you know\nThat kind of makes me like Michaelangelo\nNot to sound conceited, either to boast with what I said\nCause I'm too modest to ever lose my level head\nBut if I ever got bold and said I'm higher\nI can give more reasons than Earth, Wind & Fire\nMany follow in the footsteps, tryin' to get a rep\nOf a lover and a smooth black brother\nBut I'm knockin' imitators out the box\nBecause you couldn't copy Kane if your name was Xerox\nI'm like the God in light, some of my writing might\nBe too much for your mind to explode like dynamite\nAnd if it sounds good to you then get on it doggone it\nCapture this like a Kodak moment as I float\n\nFloat.. float on\nFloat on.. float on.. (repeat 2X)\n\nIn this third verse, I'll make it sure mental\nSee the way that you serve rap's like a death penalty\nSo back up off me, ain't nobody stoppin' Kane\nI'm shittin' on rappers like I never been potty trained\nThat means defeatin' deletin' and beatin'\nWhile all the tenderonis I'll be meetin' and greatin' and treatin'\nAnd welcome to a new Terrordome\nWhen I come to roam, you know Daddy's Home\nRhymes come at you full powered with might\nThey call in the SWAT team when I start to write\nAnd declared my lyrics illegal weapons in every state\nSo I can get five to ten for carryin a Papermate\nJust a little bitty taste of this'll burn so bad\nYou'll wanna call me the Big Daddy Inferno\nSo don't even think about a battle, I sail without a paddle\nIn other words, I FLOAT\n\nFloat.. float on\nFloat on.. float on..
