Do the math with the man in you\nLove yourself, instead of these male animals\nIt's true.  Stop looking, you'll receive what you need\nPay the bills and build\u2014you got seeds to feed\nBlessed is the mother when the man leave her\nSo take a breather.  You ain't a hoe, bitch, or a skeezer\nYou Queen Nefertiti and Zinga and Sheeba\nSo keep a strong mind and stay focused \u2018cause we need ya\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz and (Beba, Fatimah, Imani, Krystal, Rachelle, and Shani)]\nTo all the single mothers, (Keep a strong mind, stay focused)\nEven though daddy ain't here, (We know you love us)\nThat's why I dedicate this song to you\nBrighter days are coming.

It belongs to the kids\nWhat goes around comes around\u2014pretend he's doing a bid\nHave love in your heart, keep food in the fridge\nFruits and vegetables\u2014health is wealth\u2014eat to live\nWhether you Muslim, Jewish, Buddha, or Christian\nThis for every woman standing solo in the kitchen\nOver hot pots cooking and the kids won't listen\nNobody holding you down and you feel like flipping\nWe know life ain't easy when you alone working hard\nBut it's worth it\u2014you got the perfect job\nTeaching the babies.  Motherhood's a mystery force\nForce your positive thoughts to change history's course\nOf course you think he ain't doing nothing for you\nNot true, boo.

The world is crazy\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nFor all the long hours and the sleepless nights\nYour strong power and the needless fights\nYou a trooper to make it this far\nYo, it's 10 o\u2019clock and you know where your children are\nSh-sheets on the bed, roof over your head\nSh-shoes on the feet, s-seasonal threads\nCongratulation on the nation you saving\nKids make it \u2018cause of your hard work and dedication\nFor your love, discipline, and sacrifice\nYou won't have no beef in the afterlife\nIt'll be a great ending (Yup) thanks to a good start (Aw man)\nLife's a movie and guess who missed the good part?\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz and (Beba, Fatimah, Imani, Krystal, Rachelle, and Shani)]\nTo all the single mothers, (Keep a strong mind, stay focused)\nEven though daddy ain't here, (We know you love us)\nThat's why I dedicate this song to you\nBrighter days are coming.
