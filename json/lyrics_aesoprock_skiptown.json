{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Aesop Rock]\nOn the train\nWatchin' the rainbows (thank you window seat)\nI mean, it's all the same to some\nBut that cityscape makes me numb\nWalkin' the wire between firewater and water - I'll take the tap\nStill managed to end up thirsty the day the nursery collapsed\nIn my hand I hold the plumage of a buzzard\nSuffered for circlin' nutrition (seems barbaric)\nI may have just saved your children\nThere's an inborn tendency tellin' me to grip that sickle\nFor The pirate tyrant breeds feed on your precious little pixels\nI interviewed the sun, he said the future's lookin' bright\nI interviewed the rain, he claimed the sun's truly an asshole\nI was supposed to interview the snow today but of course he flaked\nSo I let my frigid demeanor teeter and take his vacant place\nWe 3 sprout from the same litter\nYet amazingly crafted by separate scissors\nI sloth from off the beaten path splashed in the cretin blizzard\nHalf my time is herded toward little lost causes\nHalf my time is spent pluggin' these leaky faucets\nAn' I'm here to pose inquiries\nI'm here to draw a fork in the road and call it the diary of common sheep aspiring\nLittle Billy starlet up the block got the right premise\nBut can't thread the needle without consultin apprentice present\nI don't really know you (I don't)\nAnd I dont' really care (I don't)\nCan't judge a man's dignity by the wattage in his stare\nMaybe that deems me that vagabond you love to kill\nBut I really ain't got time for the motherfuckin guilt\n\n[Hook]\nI'm gone and I best believe I'm leavin'\nPack up my belongings then it's off into the evening\nNow I haven't exactly been embraced by the populace\nSet sail upon the seven deadly seas of the anonymous\nI'm gone and I best believe I'm leavin'\nPack up my belongings then it's off into the evening\nAn' I'm diggin' a tunnel to where the sun'l never shine\nI've got my book I got my dream I've got myself an' I'll be fine\n(My time) is the day before the day the earth stood still\n(My time) is the day before the soldiers fired at will\n(My time) is the day before the hunter made his kill\nMy time's the final mile before the valley meets the hill\n\n[Aesop Rock]\nAnd I'm an archer\nParked where the farmers barter appetites\nSweet-talkin' harrassment down to a mere flashing of badges\nPrototypic landscape chased every step of my well-oiled collective\nWorkforce with frozen intention festive - wait\nWhat about the captivated?\nWell, I am the product of skeleton dancers poised crooked\nScattered amidst blue fields of fiery bliss mixed with\nDisease applicant activist rattlers. Fascinate grave child\nOh you're expecting slave smiles after sticking the pin in limb\nGod, if I could offer maintenance to fantasies I would\nI'd place the button in the city square for everyone to push\nYou see my mission responsibilties range across the board\nUntil I'd rather be a pen than a sword\nI swim a cold lake, make no mistake, I was not ready\nAll edgy and outta shape, made the company look messy\n(Sorry, well sorry) Honestly take it or leave it\nJust let me know so I ain't beggin' forgiveness thoughout the evening\nBasic locomotive with a whistle and caboose\nTryin to pull my cargo 'cross the map without a boost\nFragile in more ways than ten yet sturdy bird construction\nHelp the smokestacks puff until the morn, dream torn\n\n[Hook]\nI'm gone and I best believe I'm leavin'\nPacked up my belongings then it's off into the evening\nI've knocked upon every little door that comes about\nI'll sweep ya porch if you can spare a couple of breadcrumbs and a couch\nI'm gone and I best believe I'm leavin'\nPack up my belongings then it's off into the evening\nThis turning in my sleep is getting old and older still\nI think I can, I think I can, I think I can\nI think I will", "title": "Skip Town", "album": "Float", "image": "https://i.genius.com/097177ea52f6ad0147914b68157107a588f47fb2?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mushrecords.com%2Falbum_art_front%2FMH202_D.jpg", "year": "2000-09-05"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
