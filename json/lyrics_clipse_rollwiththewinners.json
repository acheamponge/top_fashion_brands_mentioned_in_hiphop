No. Whale scale tipper\nI'm from a line of ex-kingpins that's turned sniffers\nPray the Lord forgive us while the maricons fill us\nUp to the brim, call them the coffee bean spillers\nBlasphemous, he calls kis God's pillows\nIvory white, bury me in my chinchilla\nAin't none iller, no! Ain't none realer\nIt's Pusha, just ya neighborhood dope dealer\n\n[Verse 2: Ab-Liva]\nYou gotta love the gall on 'im\nTwenty on the arm on 'im\nTwenty-four inch blades, see the frame fall on 'em\nDrug czar, retired, like I was Shawn on 'em\nCame back to star -- Jordan as he falls\nReleased to score raw on 'em, 2.2 pounds exactly\nTape criss-crossed like a bra on 'em\nBut the streets I was marred, I was scarred on\nAnd ride around microphone fiend with the R on 'em\nI'm Bad, James Todd\nOn the white part of the water, my third got scalds\nOn the right side of my palm where the soft got hard\nOn the right price, give me the light, I Sean Paul on 'em\nRun the city, Sean John on 'em\nNew Marvin, screaming \"What's Going On,\"\nI'm trouble man, I rubberband man, push hard on them\nSame block where I crawled on 'em, I'mma fall on 'em\n\n[Verse 3: Malice]\nI couldn't dare do the arm, and not the neck with it;\nJesus on the charm, show some respect with it\nDon't be alarmed, if y'all don't connect with it\nSomething like the Arnage, if you select with it\nTo most a mirage, but even when I'm pinched\nThe boy far from dreaming, the Porsche with the vents\nTucked in the trunk let the dogs track the scent\n\"And I don't give a fuck,\" about our best defense\nCatch me if you can I am ginger bread\nAnd the mink interior is crimson red;\nY'all talk before they even mention Feds\nOf how I got the block like the Dawn of the Dead\nSeems amongst thieves that honor is dead\nBucking the court 'till Your Honor is dead\nY'all take heed to what is fall upon ya\nYou are in the presence, Re-Up, the ensemble\n\n[Verse 4: Sandman]\nYou got no choice but notice me, everything I drop hard\nChallenge is wiling out on opium playing dodgeball\nWith some bullets busting out the narrow barrel\nHitting you hard, your fate don't need no tarot --\nCards to be read, I reads about niggas like you daily, obituary;\nDead weight, my head straight, my bitch is very\nSteadfast, that wet ass, ki daddy marry\nFloat through your city like I'm in a ferry; took the 7-60 off it\nPut 8 o'clock on it, Eight-Double Dot-Double Zero\nAdd four more, you know the time with my earlobes\nNiggas is mad, niggas is last, niggas is fake, niggas is late\nNiggas need to be in the lake -- the bottom of it\nFuck you buck in new brick boots\nWith a burgundy wet suit for thinking you death proof, pussy"}], "artist": "Clipse"}
