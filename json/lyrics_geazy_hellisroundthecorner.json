Dress me up in stussy)\n\n[Verse 1]\nWake up, wake up, wake up\nWhat the fuck happened to me\nFeel like I woke up in another world\nMy whole life, it changed completely\nRacing and chasing for this girl\nNow I'm neighbors with the devil and he kicks it at my crib\nAnd I stay on the same block as demons, they know where I live\nThey keep knocking on my door looking for something every night\nI think I might give in soon, I feel like I'm losing this fight\nHere we go now\n\n[Hook]\nHell is round the corner where I shelter\n(Hell is round the corner, hell is round the corner)\nIf you believe or deceive, common sense says shouldn't receive\nHell is round the corner where I shelter\n(Hell is round the corner, hell is round the corner)\nHell is round the corner where I shelter\n(They juice me, seduce me. Dress me up in stussy)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYes I'm me and I know everything that I'm about to be\nBut my vision has been blinded and I can't tell what I see\nAnd I'm lost inside a sea of real deep inadequacy\nAnd I just don't know if I can swim my way on up to breathe\nBut I need to make it out of this, I'm drowning, and it's obvious\nThe problem is this pressure's heavy as a hippopotamus\nThis music's stressing me, I wonder if I'm all in this\nManic depression is what the doctor's calling this\n\n[Hook]\nHell is round the corner where I shelter\n(Hell is round the corner, hell is round the corner)\nIf you believe or deceive, common sense says shouldn't receive\nHell is round the corner where I shelter\n(Hell is round the corner, hell is round the corner)\nIf you believe or deceive, common sense says shouldn't receive"}]}
