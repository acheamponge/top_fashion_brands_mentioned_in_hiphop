Shaq]\nYo, Big Shaq (the one and only)\nI told them check the statistacs\nMan's not hot, skrrat, skidi-kat-kat, boom\n\n[Verse 1: Big Shaq]\nTwo plus two is four\nMinus one that's three, quick maths\nEveryday man's on the block, smoke trees\nSee your girl in the park, that girl is a uckers\nWhen the ting went quack-quack-quack\nYou man were ducking (remix ting)\n\n[Verse 2: Lethal Bizzle]\nFive plus five is ten, add a quick M, that's my net worth\nEvery day I drink shocker, get burse\nSee your girl in my Rolls, Snapchat, doing thot pose\nTwo twos, now she in the back, no clothes\nHold tight Muttley (my brudda), he's got the flavors\nHold tight Damon (my G), he's got the shavers\nYou might see me creep through the ends (creeping), no Benz (nah)\nHit Western Fried (quick), go check couple friends\nMy ting goes papow, pow-pow-pow-pow-pow\nChk-a-chk, papow, pow-pow-pow\nChk-a-chk, kwasia, pow-pow-pow-pow-pow\nPow-pow, leave it\n\n[Chorus: Big Shaq]\nI tell her man's not hot (never hot)\nI tell her man's not hot (never hot)\nThe girl told me, \"Take off your jacket\"\nI said, \"Babes, man's not hot\" (never hot)\n\n[Verse 3: Chip]\nChippy, ayy\nHopped out the four door with the .44, stop lying, you ain't got no mash\nBetter fix them fiction raps, man tell lies, facts (trust me)\nMan get silly on mic (wagwan), so man get drilly on guys (brrrt)\nI don't care about a million views, you'll get blasted a million times (boom)\nMan buss mic and break rules (rules), I got wordplay gems and jewels (jewels)\nIn the club in my jacket and all this ice, like man's not hot, man's cool (flex)\nLeague of my own, don't care about titles, don't mind rivals, I (baow)\nBring a storm like Michael, bad like Michael, dapper like Michael\nIn Hollywood doing ten toes (out 'ere), dressed like a London bloke (sauce)\nOut here, you can't find no wife (nah), it's just thots and skets and hoes (mad ting)\nAnd the Cali's just hitting my dome (dome), I'm too high man, I gotta go home (go yard)\nGang book flights and go, man already know how this ting goes (yeah)\n\n[Refrain: Big Shaq]\nThe ting goes skrrrahh (ah)\nPap, pap, ka-ka-ka (ka)\nSkidiki-pap-pap (pap)\nAnd a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom (boom)\n\n[Verse 4: Krept]\nMe plus your girl in a bed, equals sperm in her egg, quick science\nShe swallowed that too, quick diets (mad ting)\nYou ain't fully on arms, you ain't fully on wars\nOi Shaq, heard your ting went quack\nMy ting went woof-woof-woof and hit one of your dargs (Asnee)\nLess jokes, more bars in, them man ain't on warrin'\nMan jump out, no warnin', man ah start mmmin' and arghin'\nKojo Funds, dun talkin', skidiki pop-pop, man's sparring\nThey went Dagenham, only time man's been on barking\nKrept's so wrong, if I was on Love Island, woulda tried beat Jess, no 'dom\nI don't wanna dead no beef, I don't want to sort it out (hold tight Dave)\nThe ting goes skrrrahh, mind how you talk in south (brilliant)\nHold tight Femz (free up), he was on mayhem\nLike 15, on a 410 bus with a skeng doe, tryna do AMs (mad, mad, mad)\n\n[Verse 5: Konan]\nYour girl don't wanna let me go, must be the Versace\nNow she getting D in a car, listening to Cardi\nMy young boy got it in a party, 3-6-5 no days off\nIf I aim it dat way, I'll bet your boys all take off (dat way)\nAll I see is clowns and neeks, leave a boy counting sheep\nMum told me count to 10 before I put a boy down in street\nI hear them talkin' bout war, make sure you're sure\nI call my young boy Jay-Z, what you think he's got the .44 for?\nGirls say, \"look at his watch\", girls say, \"look at his watch\" (look at it)\nAll this ice on my top, man could never be hot (never)\nI told him gimme all three like I get it all free (gimme that)\nMy weed man from Ghana (chale), all he do is talk tree\n\n[Chorus: Big Shaq]\nI tell her man's not hot (never hot)\nI tell her man's not hot (never hot)\nThe girl told me, \"Take off your jacket\"\nI said, \"Babes, man's not hot\" (never hot)\n\n[Verse 6: Jme]\nSerious, yeah, you know the line, man thought I can only flow to grime\nSpeed equals distance over time\nWhen man said \"quick maths\", that came to mind\nMan like me get flashed and pay the fine, pay that, card or cash, it ain't declined\nIf they told you that I weren't hot, trust me, fam, that's a lie\nFuck that, man's hot, 0-60 in the whip man's got\nBurning rubber like mum's Dutch pot, smells like Michelin or Dunlop\nDem man are listening, but I'm not, don't want to hear about some cunch spot\nWith Skutnu or Oosna, man run shop, used to roll with man with a one pop\nNow I spit bars and sound like gunshots, I tell a man \"get back\"\nOr I'll slap that black flat cap, don\u2019t give me backchat\nChatting poop, look, come out the room, slap\nLeft hook, you're shook, now boom, poom-poom\nYou dun' know\n\n[Chorus: Big Shaq]\nI tell her man's not hot, I tell her man's not hot\nThe girl told me, \"Take off your jacket\"\nI said, \"Babes, man's not hot\" (never hot)\nI tell her man's not hot (never hot)\nI tell her man's not hot (never hot)\nThe girl told me, \"Take off your jacket\"\nI said, \"Babes, man's not hot\" (never hot)\n\n[Refrain: Big Shaq]\nThe ting goes skrrrahh (ah)\nPap, pap, ka-ka-ka (ka)\nSkidiki-pap-pap (pap)\nAnd a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom (boom)\nSkya (ah), du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun (dun)\nPoom, poom, you don' know\n\n[Outro: Big Shaq]\nBig Shaq, man's not hot\nI tell her man's not hot (never hot)\n40 degrees and man's not hot (come on)\nYo, in the sauna, man's not hot (never hot)\nYeah, skidika-pap-pap"}], "artist": "Big Shaq"}
