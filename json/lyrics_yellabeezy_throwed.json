your lungs\nDo the cowgirl, then I'ma beat your front\nSkeet it all on your face, baby, meet my son\nFuck a Cliff nigga, baby, I'ma freak you dumb\nComment every day sayin' she want some\nHate her boring ass ex, say she want fun\nStuck in a dark place, say she want sun\nSay if I pin her down then she won't run\nI'ma kill that pussy, say she won't mourn\nFuck three times but she want more\nReal

boy, I can guarantee\nAnd you can get throwed but you should know\nIf you get it, you ain't never leavin'\nWarning, you get caught up, won't leave me 'lone\nDown, boy, you gon' get some, I'ma fill you
