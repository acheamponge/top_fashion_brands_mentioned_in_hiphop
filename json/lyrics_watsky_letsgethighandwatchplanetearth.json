(x3)\nPlanet Earth, Planet Earth\nWatch it spin, watch it spin\nYou and me, planet earth\n\n[Verse 1]\nAnd yes, yes, let's let's let\u2019s get some takeout\nPress our hearts together like when kids make Barbies make out\nLet's make out, no toothpaste\nI only want to know how you taste\nWe don't need to tie no shoelace\nAnd we don't need to pack no suitcase\nTo, to find a new place. Let our moment linger\nWe'll weave our hands together and then kiss this braid of fingers\nUntil the whisper, whisper of time's undying rivers\nCome decorate our skin with crow\u2019s feet, spider-veins and fissures\nBut we won't cry, we won't cry, we'll step into that cyclone\nTogether when we're blinded and our minds erode like limestone\nAnd all we can remember's how we make each other feel, then\u2026\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy don\u2019t we get high and watch Planet Earth? (x3)\nPlanet Earth, Planet Earth\nWatch it spin, watch it spin\nYou and me, planet earth\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy don\u2019t we get high and watch Planet Earth? (x3)\nPlanet Earth, Planet Earth\nWatch it spin, watch it spin\nYou and me, planet earth\n\n[Outro - Paul Watsky]\n\u2026Ah, the hippies, ah, were sort of wide-eyed with floppy pants and things like that.
