Talk with the gospel\nDisappear in a synagogue, or die in mosque old\nOr appear with men of god, or discovered the lost scroll\nWas he reborn as Van Gogh, Aristotle or Picasso\nWas he formed from New York lights or winds from Chicago\nHow\u2019s he one man? that sounds like an ensemble\nWill they dig him up like charcoal, when they find his soul is part gold\nPreserve his mind for millions of years, or display it in an art show\nBecause the words that he uses, only a few can imagine\nAt night, when I write, my soul infuses with the Dragon\nThere\u2019s nothing new under the planet, there\u2019s nothing new under Atlantis\nThere\u2019s nothing new under the sun, you\u2019re confused with the enchanted\nI vibrated out of the universe, at nine thousand terahertz\nSound and light formulated, from matter I was due at birth\nThe story of every plant, animal and human\u2019s birth\nThey said they built Sumer first, some say it was Egypt\nLet\u2019s reveal the secret, they say Lucy was a priestess\nAn open letter to the church, more mummies more tombs to search\nI\u2019ll be out of sight, out of mind, do the work\nAnd I\u2019ll be back at the end of time and I\u2019ll prove my worth\n\n[Outro: Lecture Extract]\nThe esoteric fabric of the Universe this is the blueprint, everything in existence comes out of the vibratory state which is called in quantum science quantum mechanics, the unified field\n\n[Outro 2]\nWhat has been will be again and what has been done will be done again, there's nothing new under the sun\nWe think that we have the leading edge in technology\n\"We are the apex\" of the world civilizations but I don't think this is true\nMore and more despite the foot dragging and... and the, nay saying by archaeologist and historians and everything else\nWe are more and more coming to learn that apparently at one point there was a planet-wide highly technical civilization on tthis planet... and something happened"}]}
