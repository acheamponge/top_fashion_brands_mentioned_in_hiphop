Well, lady your instruments, whatever\nYou know what I'm talking about\n\nBecause we have a big, big problem on our hands\nAnd I say before we let this blob take over our city\nWe funk him outta town\nYa'll ready?\n\nBlob, you goin' down\nHey, hey, hey, blob, get out of town\nThe Westley mob gon' make you frown\nHey, hey, hey, blob, you goin' down\n\nNuclear waste, sloppy joe\nWhere it goes no one knows\nMaybe underground where it's found\nBut it can't play here no more, sing, come on\n\nNuclear waste, sloppy joe\nWhere it goes no one knows\nMaybe underground where it's found\nBut it can't play here no more\n\nHey, hey, hey, blob, you goin' down\nHey, hey, hey, blob, get out of town\nThe Westley mob gon' make you frown\nHey, hey, hey, blob, you goin' down\n\nWell done soldiers, the battle is won\nBut the war continues\nThanks to every last one of you courageous Funkaneers\nAtlanta can sleep tight tonight\n\nBecause you faced your problems head on\nYou didn't run away from 'em\nAnd that's how true players do it\nThey get straight to it, at ease soldiers"}], "artist": "Andr\u00e9 3000"}
