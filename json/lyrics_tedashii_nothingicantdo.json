All that fame done gone to my head?\nLike that same power that save me\nCan't raise me from the dead\nThey get me reading thinking bout keeping peace\nWhile I'm raging war on myself\nI'm feeling myself then I'm killing myself\nI'm sipping on blood and I'm chewing on flesh\nJust chill out we don't want to hear that mess\nAll that 'won't do that' & 'I can't do this'\nPain, death, hurt, hate we done been through this\nAnd I'm sure there's plenty more that I ain't been through yet\nBut I don't care though, bring on the heavy metal\nI got a power living in me that'll never settle\nNever leave nor forsake I'm a bleed never break\nI'm a die come back with the keys to the safe\nGotta keep sitting deep for the things that I face\nCan't erase God's ink wait clean with the paint\nAnd I'm stained in it when the pain hit me\nI withstand anything that you bring to me\nThey love to tell me what I can\u2019t do faithfully\nThey love to tell me what I can\u2019t do faithfully\nThey love to tell me what I can\u2019t do faithfully\nI'm coming back from the dead what you saying to me\nI can't do\n\n[Hook: Trip Lee]\nI can't do, there ain't nothin' I can't do\nThere ain't nothin' I can't do\nThere ain't nothin' I can't do\nI can't do, there ain't nothin' I can't do\nThere ain't nothin' I can't do\nLook it ain't nothin' I can't do\n\n[Bridge: Trip Lee]\nMight walk on water\nI won't lose a step\nGot-gotta go hard\nBut I ain't gotta do it myself\nI can't do, there ain't nothin' I can't do\nFeelin like I can't lose\nThere ain't nothin' I can't do"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
