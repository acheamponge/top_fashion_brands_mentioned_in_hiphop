Sanford\nThis is a big one honey\nI'm coming to join ya with some birds and money\nThat I just jacked from this fool\nI see the snitch in his eye\nCall me mister Candid Camera\nGive a hater suprise\nI know some homies big and back being boo\nSome G's kick, kack a shake groove\nDon't make me act a fool\nI'm just a pimped ass fool smoking mega sacks\nAnd we go back like dwarf hats and croaker sacks\nWhat's a studio player that's really soft\nIt's like the Dayton Wire without the eagle knockoffs\nIt's like mixing Pop Rocks and 7 Up; it don't mix\nCan I give these janky-ass fools a quick fix\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm about\nMaking major papers\nYou's about\nBeing a major hater\nYou busters can't see me though\nGame is air tight\n\nIt's the world's guinness book of haters\nLets dip under P, for perpertrators\n\nFool be colder than a roof on 95 hundred\nI'll jack your D's and your girl if I want it\n\nIt's the world's guinness book of pages\nLet's flick under F, for straight out fakers\n\nCojones be colder than a roof on 95 hundred\nI'll jack yo D's and your sack if I want it\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's like radio\nSometimes they never play me\nUntil I went underground\nLike Master P\nReal O.G.s strictly for the homies in the game\nNo pain no gain\nJust hoping that, Mr. Kane\nPenetentiary chances\nGhetto advancements\nI click my romeo's three times\nBut I know I'm not in Kansas\nI'm a jack of all trades\nMaster of 1\nAnd the thing that I mastered\nIs making everybody sprung\nMany stanky ass record labels\nCan eat a fat dizz-nick\nGot some white college fool\nCriticing my tune\nBoy ain't never been down to the ghetto\nWhere fools slang yayo out of broken down apartments\nAll of a sudden he's head of the rap department\nI slang my tapes out the trunk of my Impala\nWell alright\nSell 50000 units make a half a million Dollars\nFool be in my mix like paparazzo\nJust because I went from rags to Tini 'n Asti Spumante\n\nSo forgive me if I diss your played out crew\nYa shouldn't hate the next player getting theirs\nWhen you can get yours too\nI'm not never find the moment\nWaiting for the next player to pay my bills\nIf I can't get my respect I'mma kill at will\nAnd that's real, that's real, that's real\n\nWent from rags to skyscrapers\nMajor papers equals major haters\nHmm, yeah\nWhat Eazy say\nThe more problems you make, the more problems you get\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm about\nMaking major paper\nUse about\nBeing a major hater\nYou busters can't see me though\nGame is air tight\n\nIt's the world's guinness book of haters\nLet's dip under P, for perpertrators\n\nFool be colder than a roof on 95 hundred\nI'll jack yo Z's and your girl if I want it\n\nIt's the world's guinness book of haters\nLet's flick under F, for straight out fakers\n\nFool be colder than a roof on 95 hundred\nI'll jack yo sack and your D's if I want it\n\n[Outro]\nYa understand that\nWe act like a payphone? in here\nFrom the land of sunshine and palm trees\nAirbreak to shoe\nAnd you don't wanna fuck with me\nYou don't wanna fuck with me\nI must give it up for DJ Silk\nFunky tie? up for me\nAirbreak to shoe\nWoo, woo\n\nThem gangster hits\nWe got what it takes, yeah"}]}
