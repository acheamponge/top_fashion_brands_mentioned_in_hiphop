I bill them\nSince I was a chillun, I'd see them BMXs and steal them\nA bad boy, just a tad coy, getting told on to the tabloids\nQuiet, but my actions made loud noise\nNow, more than ever, I crave attention, I\u2019m ADD\nAt my last shows, I brought many hoes, like 80 deep\nSkating cheap, cheap skate, my money stay in wallets\nUntil I cop Impalas, polish them big like Christopher Wallace\nI honestly think I\u2019m hotter than most of your favorite rappers\nTurn them girls on like old people do Clappers\nDick so big, my girl thought it was a strap-on\nIt took fucking forever to find this beat just to rap on\nNow it's on, I\u2019m starting to get warmed up\nPractice drills, rapping until I'm stacking mills, trying to get more bucks\nLike Milwaukee's scouting couch, I\u2019m trying to get more Bucks\nThese hoes full of drugs more than Lil Wayne's tour bus\nI\u2019m sure you know: super flow, super beats, Super 3\nThey used to call me super lame\nWhat that make me, Superman?\nThen call me Clark Kent, I get more ass than a park bench\nDirty toilet seat, don\u2019t start shit\nThat\u2019s a smart tip, if you want it, you should take it\nRap is love, don\u2019t fake it, just make it\n\n[Outro: brandUn DeShay]\n...And we'll keep it moving\nMaestro?", "year": "2009-12-25", "album": "Your Favorite!
