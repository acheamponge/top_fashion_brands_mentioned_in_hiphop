Blue skies, white clouds, fish jumpin' in your hand\nWhat a day to be fishin' ole Nantucket sound\nFrom the island up to the mainland\n\nChorus:\nGet me my fiddle we'll sing all old songs\nYou take the high notes, and I'll take the low\nGood times and hard times, there all worth the telling\nIt don't matter to me that you sing 'em that well\n\n2. I remember the days when you worked for a living\nPulling hard just to get back to shore\nAnd you busted your back and you didn't get dinner\nWe don't talk much of that anymore\n3. Stayed up with the old folks, fell asleep to their stories\nPlayed a tune to the hollerin' wind\nSang a song while the children were put away warm\nAnd the night tides came rollin' back in\n\n4. Worn out, smellin' of bait\nCome home when the wind blows you home\nAnd the sun over west chalk, the warm summer breezes\nMake you think that things never will change\n\n(repeat first verse)\n@music @fish\nFilename[ LANINANT\nDC\n===DOCUMENT BOUNDARY", "title": "Alien", "year": null, "album": null}], "artist": "Unknown Artist"}
