I feel like Uncle Sam\nBro she like Curry, that 30 don't jam\nI got it back now it's all in my hands\nStayed on my toes I ain't switch on my mans\nKill em, be humble and stick to the plan\nI'm in the cut, I don't fuck with the VIP\nThese females ain't loyal, they always on dicks\nStay in the job, I can't be in the mix\nThey want me to fail but instead I took risks\nLook at me now like I'm making them sick\nFuck all the diamonds, I shine regardless\nI got the vision, yes I'm an artist\nI tell em pull up cause we got the bargain\n\n[Chorus]\nBitch I'm ballin on these niggas, Jordan when I dunk\nShe popped a perc and sipped my lean, she thought she was drunk\nMy niggas savage, riding with the chopper in the trunk\nI Barry Bonds that pussy you know I don't ever bunt\nI'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex\nI'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex\nI'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex\nI need that work, I need that bag, give me my fucking check\n\n[Verse 2]\nThat nigga talking, I know he ain't real\nSay he won't switch, bet he will for the deal\nWork my ass off till my hands touch a mil\nRollin up dope, getting high for the thrill\nGave her the D now she all in her feels\nHitting my phone all the time cannot chill\nI do not love you, ain't paying ya bills\nShe want some clout but I ain't Dr. Phil\nWe got in late when we came in the door\nHoes in the couch money all in the floor\nAin't running out keep the bag in galore\nI shine like a star in the clouds where I soar\nFunny thing is I was just by the store\nTrapping with bro making plays to get more\nNow I'm on flights taking trips to explore\nGive me two years and I'm going on tour\nIt's all we got, bitch you know what it is\nNow I'm the man you can't call me a kid\nNo looking back on the shit that I did\nHitting them licks, laying low from the pigs\nRolling up gas drinking lean like i'm sick\nBro trappin hard making plays out the whip\nI'm in the studio making these hits\nChasing my dreams while they sit back and wish\nNigga you know what it is (Woah)\nNigga you know what it ain't\nAnd these niggas ain't felt all my pain\nTell that nigga just stay in his lane\nSmoking gas and it's smelling like dank\nAnd my shooters pull up in a tank\nAnd she love me, I'm fresh out the bank\nI can't save you, girl I ain't no saint\n\n[Chorus]\nBitch I'm ballin on these niggas, Jordan when I dunk\nShe popped a perc and sipped my lean, she thought she was drunk\nMy niggas savage, riding with the chopper in the trunk\nI Barry Bonds that pussy you know I don't ever bunt\nI'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex\nI'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex\nI'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex\nI need that work, I need that bag, give me my fucking check"}], "artist": "Lil Skies"}
