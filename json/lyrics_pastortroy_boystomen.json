Hell naw\nListen lemme tell yall\nYouth transformed mommas only into eightball\nEverywhere I go niggas know I speak that poetry\nSing my Chilouette like Alfred Hitchcock and they know it's me\nDown the line, met a lot of niggas on the grind\nHit plenty dimes\nMurder they asses make it seem like I commit the crime\nA friend of mine, won't rap into illegal business\n18 wheelers, fed X and brickes did with killas\nHe smoked and dipped'em drunk wit chrysey\n(?)\nThem bitches down though, come straight back afta they get through strippin\nI'm out of town, Nextel jerkin it's his lil brother cryin\nTold me his brother killed hisself, I say nigga you lyin\nHe put the gun in his mouth and blew his brains 0ut\nHe couldn't handle (?) this shit we sang b0ut\n\n[Chorus]\nNo one to pry me, I'm all alone\nNo one to cry on\nHe'd shelter from the rain to ease the pain\nChanging from boys to men..", "year": "2004-03-23"}]}
