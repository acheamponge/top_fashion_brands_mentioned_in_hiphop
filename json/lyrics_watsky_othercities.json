This is where I've got the richest history;\nStacked with six or seven memories on every single street;\nI never missed a beat;\nI'm soaked in city pride;\nAnd me oh my, this foggy sky got me misty eyed;\n\n[Hook]\nThere might be other cities half as raw as ours;\n(just as 'bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it)\nOut in some distant galaxy among the stars;\n(But I doubt it, doubt it, doubt it)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe don't play tiny violins over minor things;\nWe slide into the ring takin' Tyson swings;\nBecause this city will defend our fuckin' pride\nAnd raise each other up like Simba in the Lion King;\nWe're not shy;\nI ain't no coy coward;\nI'll be doin' trust falls offa Coit tower;\nMy boys on the ground floor providin' man power;\nBut if I die now, mix me into clam chowder;\nPut me in a bread bowl, feed me to the seagulls;\nBut not the freakin' tourists;\nI'm sure they're peachy people;\nI guess I'm just a purist;\nIt isn't oil, but there's somethin' in the water\nAnd it's got me feelin' diesel;\n\n[Hook]\nThere might be other cities half as raw as ours;\n(just as 'bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it)\nOut in some distant galaxy among the stars;\n(But I doubt it, doubt it, doubt it)\n\n[Outro: Bobby \"Blue\" Bland]\n\nAin't no love, in the heart of the city;\nAin't no love, in the heart of town;\nAin't no love, in the heart of the city;\nAin't no love, in the heart of town;\nAin't no love", "image": "https://images.genius.com/15b416d55e0958076696e8b871573bd9.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "Nothing Like the First Time", "title": "Other Cities"}]}
