Because \"V\" means five and\nYou come to Chicago, you can see me live and\nIf one of you niggas rap, you're going to see me laughing\nI don't mean to be rude because that was me two years ago\nAlmost, y'all brag, I'll boast\nY'all swag, I'll floss because swag rhymes with fag but floss rhymes with cost\nI paid that to be the boss\nNow all my ex-girls talking about, \"I dated that guy\"\nAnd all the haters still talking about, \"I hated that guy\"\nI'm like the Wright brothers, dog, I created what's fly\nAnd one day, no more waiting in line\nI thank God for all the fans that I got\nBut all my fans are my friends or my fam, so I'll be damned if I don't take my friends to the top\nFront row, friends in the box\nCause in time, keep an eye on me like the hands on the clock\nI swear, y'all, I'm on the ball like the hands on the block\nAnd I ain't lying, but I don't stand for the nonsense\nI named my dick Magic, they won\u2019t stay off my Johnson\nYeah, and if anybody knows Mark Ronson\nTell him to hit me up with a phone call or a email\nTrying my best to spare these rappers like details\nMySpace wankstas, fake like Lee Nails\nThey're spitting in the booth, but no Proof like D12\nRest in peace to him, and if you got it right, I'll do it\nThat means I'll do it right, I felt I need to recite\nOr reiterate, almost quit in a fit of rage\nBecause I don't get a lot of love on my Twitter page\nBut I had a couple of girls in a john, Ritter-way\nI had to get away, dropped the trash like litter day\nI'm sure they'll come back to haunt me like karma\nBut mamma, when it does, I'll get to running like Obama\nThen I'll get to winning like a Kenyan, fly-like opinion\nMake the best decision, in my opinion\nMoney over bitches, that's a win-win\nI thank 2Pac for his envisions on division\nNow, listen, all jokes aside\nI'm bringing the CC's to keep hip-hope alive\nClear!\n\n[Outro: brandUn DeShay]\nNow, I'm gonna shut up and let y'all get the free beat\nYou chop it, you got it\nHolla", "year": "2009-02-23", "album": "Volume: Two!
