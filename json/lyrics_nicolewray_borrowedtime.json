Too good\nMy heart says it's no use 'cause you're leavin' soon\n\nWe'll never get away\nStill day by day\nBut it's killin' me, oh yes, it's killin' me\n'Cause I know that you're feelin' me, baby\n\nYou don't belong to me\nAnd I don't belong to you\nNo matter how hard we try\nWe're still on borrowed time\n\nYou still go home to her\nSo you can't belong to me\nAlthough it feels so right\nWe're still on borrowed time\n\nYou gotta stop callin' me\nAnd tellin' me\nI'm where you'd rather be\nIt's been nineteen weeks\n\nAnd you're still playin' your games everyday, no\nI would never ever want to hurt her, no no\nSo I'll take the initiative and let you go\nUntil you're ready to come home to me\n\nYou don't belong to me\nAnd I don't belong to you\nNo matter how hard we try\nWe're still on borrowed time\n\nBaby, the hardest thing is gonna be\nIs gonna be getting over you so easy\nYou know when I gave you my all everyday\nBut it's best for all of us to move on\n'Cause no matter what I think we'll be\nYou'll never belong to me\n\nYou don't belong to me\nAnd I don't belong to you\nNo matter how hard we try\nWe're still on borrowed time\n\nYou still go home to her\nSo you can't belong to me\nAlthough it feels so right\nWe're still on borrowed time\n\nSomehow, some way\nAll mine, only mine\nSo good, too good\nWhoa, too much borrowed time\n\nYou don't belong to me\nAnd I don't belong to you\nNo matter how hard we try\nWe're still on borrowed time\n\nYou still go home to her\nSo you can't belong to me\nAlthough it feels so right\nWe're still on borrowed time"}], "artist": "Nicole Wray"}
