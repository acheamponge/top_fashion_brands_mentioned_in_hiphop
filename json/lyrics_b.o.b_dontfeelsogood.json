{"songs": [{"year": null, "lyrics": "[Intro]\nThey say life's for living\nWell I don't feel so good today\nI guess I'll drift away\nI just get this feeling\nBecause this system is a cage\nLike the prison gates\nAnd if you don't feel it\nThen how come Independence Day\nIs just a holiday\n\n[Refrain]\nI get the feeling that this boat\nI feel this boat\nIs about to sink, cause it can't float\nIt can not float\nAnd I get the feeling that we're close\nI feel we're close\nTo the end of the pain that we all know\nThat we all know\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell excuse my expression\nBut I don't give a fuck today\nSo there's not much to say\nWell I went to my bed\nBut crazy thoughts kept running through my head\nI need some Sudafed\nWell if you were my mirror\nThen you would see a very sad look on my face\nThe life of Bobby Ray\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell if I gave you a few words to show my most genuine emotion\nThey would not describe the way I feel inside\nActually you would have to experience an explosion\nSo I, just learn to control em\nKeep my spirit high to keep my kundalini flowing\nThrough the the seven-point chakra system\nFrom my toes to the top of my head\nAnd in between my shoulders\nIf you don't know than you probably can't focus\nOn nothing but the TV\nSo your mind ain't yours\nYou're getting lied to and you don't even know it\nThe youth's so blind but they eyes wide open\n\n[Refrain]", "title": "Don\u2019t Feel So Good", "album": "May 25th", "image": "https://images.genius.com/51bfc55fdc338bff1c957159669698ce.320x320x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
