Don't you love me?\nGuess you don't want me, you don't want me\n(Wait)\nWe back and forth, yeah, this ain't working, this ain't working\nLove ain't perfect, love ain't perfect\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm holding on to pieces of us\nThat I just can't let go\nI know this is a desperate kind of love\nBut it feels like it's home\nWhere you going? (Where you going?)\nI'm holding on to pieces of us\n'Cause I just can't let go\n\n[Verse 2]\nWait, wait, wait\nDon't leave me\nWait, wait, wait (wait)\nWhat you thinking? What you thinking?\nWhere's your mind at?\n(Wait)\nDon't you miss us, don't you miss us?\n'Cause you don't call back, you don't call back\n(Wait)\nAre you happy? Tell me, are you happy?\nAre you smiling? Are you smiling?\n(Wait)\nGirl, what happened? Tell me, girl, what happened?\n'Cause I am dying, I am dying\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm holding on to pieces of us\nThat I just can't let go\nI know this is a desperate kind of love\nBut it feels like it's home\nWhere you going? (Where you going?)\nI'm holding on to pieces of us\n'Cause I just can't let go\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe don't wanna have a conversation\nWe don't wanna think about it, we wanna just fake it\nWe just wanna act like everything is great\nGo back to the day watchin' movies in the basement\nAnd the problem is now I'm feeling like everything is changed\nAnd I'm trying to make a livin' on the music\nBut I feel like every time I look at you I'm in a place\nIt's hard to be the man of the house when you ain't got a house (I hate this)\n(Yeah) It's complicated, it's complicated\nWe don't wanna talk (We don't wanna talk)\nIt's complicated\nI'm sitting in the hotel room like, \"Why?\"\nI call your phone and apologize\nThere's gotta be a way we can make this right\nWe can make this right\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm holding on to pieces of us\nThat I just can't let go\nI know this is a desperate kind of love\nBut it feels like it's home\nWhere you going? (Where you going?)\nI'm holding on to pieces of us\n'Cause I just can't let go\n\n[Outro]\nI'm holding onto pieces of us\nThat I just can't let go\nI know this is a desperate kind of love\nBut it feels like it's home\nWait, wait, wait\nDon't leave me\nWait, wait, wait\nDon't leave me"}], "artist": "NF"}
