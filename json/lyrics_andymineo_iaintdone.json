Once you level up\nDon't you know the boss is bigger, yeah\nUsed to spend a lot of time daring myself\nThen spent a lot of time comparing myself\nTurn into the doubt, then the fear in myself\nOverthinking to the point I was imparin' myself\nNow I know why Chappelle went missing\nNow I know why Brit got the clippers\nNow I know why Ye started trippin\nThe pressure and the expectation get ya, ah\n\n[Break]\nOh well if they don't like it\nI might turn up by myself\nI don't need opinions\nNo, I did this for myself (For myself, aye)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDeath to my depression and anxiety\nDeath to all my stress and what I'm trying to be\nI'ma get live, 'cause I'm still alive\nAnd if I die, ain't no way I'm giving up now\n\n[Chorus]\nI ain't done, I ain't done, I ain't done\nAs long as there's breath in my lungs\nI ain't done, I ain't done, I ain't done\nAs long as there's breath in my lungs, I ain't done\n\n[Outro]\nI know you feel like you can't change\nI know you think it'll always be the same\nI want to be full of potential again\nBut I ain't done\n\n[Rough vocalization of the beat]"}]}
