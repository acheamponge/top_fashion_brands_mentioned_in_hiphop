What's the source? What's the meanin'?\nI can never know, I can never feel, my brain is peelin'...\nMy spirit is extractin', my reaction is not plastic\nIt's magic, it's havoc, combine to make what I imagine\nInfected like a Komodo dragon\nOne bite from the teeth is a [?]\nTenderize my brain cells\nWelcome to my hell\nAll around the world\nCome and fall apart\nBefore they pull the plug\n\n[Chorus: Yelawolf]\nJust give me a reason to quit baby\nA reason to give all my money\nI'm in it for life without you, my love\nMy pain is only brief\nIt's only a moment of time before a dime bag reaches my pipeline\nBaby, my love", "title": "Heroine"}]}
