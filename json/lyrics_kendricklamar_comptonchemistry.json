(what?)\nLemme put my gloves on\nAnd my scrubs on\nI'm the chemist that's whippin' it in the kitchen\nThis here is not for the children\nYou need parental advision\nIf you wanna learn how to cook in the dope business\nFirst you bargain shop\nLook for the priciest chickens\nI recommend that you pay\nJorge a visit\nGot it wrapped in saran\n17.5 no\nDrop four grand\nThis is LA man\nUnless it be a drought\nBut homie if it ain't\nThen it is somewhere else\nFlip your hustle down south\nThat's a whole other story though\nBack to the lesson\nHope you're takin' down your footnotes\nClass is in session\nGet your instruments\nGrab some baking soda, a triple beam, a beaker\nAnd a hanger you can stir it with\nSplit nine Os four ways in that 36\nPlace it on the triple beam\nAs hard as it may seem, it's not that tricky\nSay you'll get it baby just bear with me\nConfidence before compliments\nNow let's get busy\nThis is the procedure\n250 grams of coke, 150 grams of soda\nPlace it in the beaker\nYour water should be boiling by then\nGrab a small cup and pour it in\nTwist the hanger until it's paper thin\nPlace the hanger in the beaker then give your wrist a circular spin\nBut hold on it gets tricky again!\nAs your hand rotate\nYou're probably thinkin' it's safe\nUntil it starts to harden, slowing down the pace\nThe muscle inside your arm is makin' your joints ache\nYou're strugglin' on the job, but don't lose faith\nWait...you got it back soft (good)\nNow pour some hot water inside the beaker jar\nThe work should rise to the top\nThen pour some cold water on that\nThat's when the dope should drop\nSnatch the cookie out the jar, grab a razor from the cabinet\nPlace it on the cardboard, then chop\nAs soon as the razor hit the work, you're happy\nYou're excited that the chemistry worked\nThis the fiend's appetite\nThis bigger than life\nYou turned to Mr. Nino Brown in one night\nYou should thank me twice\nThough you learned from a chemist who never moved a brick in his life\nHow ironic...hmm\nLike most of you rappers\n\n[Outro: Ab Soul]\nAw I don't believe that man\nYou're too professional with it man\nThere's no way you've never done it before, know what I mean\nThat was too descriptive"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
