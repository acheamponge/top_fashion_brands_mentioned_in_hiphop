That\u2019s a pretty good idea\nI\u2019ll give you the moon, Mary\"\n\"I'll take it\"\n\n[Verse]\nBaby, I could give you the moon\nYou know he can't do what I do\nYeah, It's true\nGirl, I think I'm dyin' real soon\nWe could die in my room\nMe and you\nBaby, I could give you the moon\nYou know he can't do what I do\nYeah, It's true\nGirl, I think I'm dyin' real soon\nWe could die in my room\nMe and you\nI'ma keep you in mind\nWhile I drive right by\nSay goodbye to the nice guy\nI'm wastin' my time\nGivin' you rhymes\nYou gotta give me a dime\nBefore I do that again\nAnd I ain't trippin', I'm high\nIn the trunk of the Benz\nIs where my women reside\nWhere my women will die\nI ain't got no friends\nAnd I don't listen to y'all\nI'm equipped for the fall\nAnd the winter and all\nWhen the summer come\nI'ma have enough to get the fuck out\nI could buy a truck and\nDrive that motherfuckin' truck out (Skrr)\nTryna buy luck\nIf you don't die that means you lucked out\nI ain't tryna fuck\nI see the moon and bug the fuck out\n\n[Outro: Sample from \"It's a Wonderful Life\"]\n\"Mary, I know what I\u2019m going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that\nI\u2019m shaking the dust of this crummy little town far behind and I\u2019m going to see the world\nItaly, Greece, the Parthenon, the Coliseum. Then I\u2019m coming back here and I\u2019ll go to college and see what they know and then I\u2019m going to build things\nI\u2019m going to build air fields. I\u2019m going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high\nI\u2019m going to build bridges a mile long. Well, are you going to throw a rock?\nHey, that\u2019s pretty good. What\u2019d you wish, Mary?\""}], "artist": "Lil Peep"}
