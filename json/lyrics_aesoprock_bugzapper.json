{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe first step is a doozy, it\u2019s roulette with a mood ring\nThe birth of an old slang, the death of a new speak\nA permanent post-game is littered with bridge trolls\nSkirting the copay, divvy the death toll\nInnumerable codenames, alerted and mobile\nFamiliar rising, and furnacing cold piles\nResilient style kings, impossibly tantrum\nWandering wild things, obelisk phantoms\nOn linoleum or lava, leaders of a leadfoot fauna\nHis left source blunt force trauma\nNot pillar of the commune, a splinter off the pagan\nWho vote off the elusiveness of truth and exultation\nFrom the point of view of students labeled putrid little aphids\nBy the beautiful and cryogenic stasis\nSadists, meanwhile makers of a hideous whatnot\nCommitted to a lowdown Sisyphus up-rock\nAre shaving at a truck stop, aging exponentially\nHomie, no myth flowers grow where he piss\nAnd I still row boats outta bottles without abandon\nTo shrink into the sunset bumping Pachelbel's Canon\nIn D motherfucker, the author of the artistry\nMay or may not be weeping to an automated pharmacy\n\nHello. Hello? Shit\n\n[Hook]\nToo geeked up to even keep it down\nToo peaced out to even be around\nToo beat up to even breathe it out\n(Too freaked out to even leave your house) x5\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou wish you could dance more, I wish you would talk less\nMy gentleman transformed, to bringers of offed heads\nMoments of land war, my Lazarus species\nTattered and bruised up, from back in the cheap seats\nHackers on crew cuts, foam at the mush mouth\nGag at the news truck, notably unsound\nDragging his clown shoes, food in his moustache\nRaggedy hounds tooth, zilch on a bus pass\nI\u2019m good, house at the beach of expelled hubcaps\nBlack lawn, backyard melting into Lovecraft\nBad yarn spun by the hum of the bug zapper\nOf kings becoming runners, and runts becoming alphas\nAnd underdogs with posters of a front-side Tony Alva\nOn the sticker laden walls above their uncle\u2019s Bowie albums\nGraduate to flyers of an execrated sigil\nAnd live to see another sexy generation fizzle\nOut, keep rap homely\nBear claw slippers, over-sized Billy Joel tee\nFat-faced, potbelly, neckbeard, crow\u2019s feet\nRat nest, gross teeth, pock marks, go team\nI walk with Hawaii on a greenscreen behind me\nSo even the awkward pauses feel inviting\nStanding at a landmark sleep drought keep out\nCan\u2019t talk now too freaked out\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Bug Zapper", "album": "Cat Food EP", "image": "https://images.genius.com/66b3619fd742e9e2c965031550f75194.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2015-01-05"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
