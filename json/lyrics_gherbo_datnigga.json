nigga\nAy, 16 fucking bitches 30 they can't get enough, cause\nWay before this rap shit bitch I been that nigga\nI know that they mad i see their temper tantrums\nWonder why i'm humble they can't understand it\nWhen I got them racks up I just rubber band em\nNigga now my momma live in a mini mansion\nAnd i'm at the top now and they still can't stand it\nThey know where i come from i'm a fucking bandit\nStarted from the bottom now i'm getting figures, but\nWay before this rap shit bitch i been that nigga\n\n[Verse 1]\nBig G Herbo bitch I been that nigga Ay\nEver since i was 15 been about my figures\nBy my 17th birthday i had a 50 remember right before my 18th birthday i crashed them Hemi\nWay before this rap shit Lil Roc knew i had it in me\nWay before this rap shit white folks knew i had it in me\nFreestyling on that hot shit block shit few blocks past the enemy\nFully autos we got plenty bitch we blast at any\nStart sipping 8s of act with kobe made me break my kidneys\nAnd now I still might sip a 4 way just because I miss him\nAnd i rap about that trap shit i was in the kitchen\nFolk nem copped their first book i was right there my left wrist a 50\nAnd if the feds come I won't write them I might forget to mention\nThey ain't cut from my cloth they ain't like that man these niggas bitches\nI don't want no fuck niggas around me thats a disposition\nI don't do no rap beef nigga try me pistol whip or strip him\nPussy better mind your business my little killas itching\nDisrespect No Limit thats a bad decision\nLil bro tote that glizzy and he got precision\nTold him just get money and play your position\nBitch i been that nigga ever since elementary\nAlways in the mix I used to get suspensions\nNow my whips like bitches cause thats how I switch em\nGot my bitches switching kissing lied say that i missed them\nGrowing up I ran the streets I learned a lot of wisdom\nAlways use your head and duck that prison system\nBroski told me take care of business I can't lie I listened\nHe supposed to be still here right with me and thats why i miss him\n\n[Hook]\nStarted from the bottom now i'm getting figures, but\nWay before this rap shit bitch I been that nigga\nAy, 16 fucking bitches 30 they can't get enough, cause\nWay before this rap shit bitch I been that nigga\nI know that they mad i see their temper tantrums\nWonder why i'm humble they can't understand it\nWhen i got them racks up I just rubber band em\nNigga now my momma live in a mini mansion\nAnd i'm at the top now and they still can't stand it\nThey know where I come from i'm a fucking bandit\nStarted from the bottom now i'm getting figures\nWay before this rap shit bitch I been that nigga\n\n[Verse 2]\nIm 20 so its only right put 220 on the dash\nSmoking Posto by the zip 220 for the gas\n150 strong thats 22 thats 40 imma blast\nOf course if you reach for him i'll pay for him all cash\nTwo 30s and one 50 round thats how I ride around\nFuck nigga you don't fit around you on the wrong side of town\nAnd you best turn that 50 around I mean correct it now\nIf this was back in 2009 folk nem would of wet you down\nRIP grandma I miss you I won't let you down\nI know you ain't hurting no more you ain't stressing now\nMember on the phone you said you want a platinum Album\nIts 3:21 i'm thinking of them records now\nComing up my momma said I wasn't a bad kid\nI just made my choices and dealt with them as is\nNow i pay my momma rent i'm talking cash shit\nI see their fake smiles in my face like they ain't mad shit\nI know they hating when i did it they still say I didn't\nStreet nigga I can't even count the blessings i been getting\nAll the commas I been spending bad hoes I been hitting\nFuck around in the new car brand new limit froze up to much spinning\nWalk in the bank pulled out 30k they like what you doing today\nI look at the teller I ain't know what to tell her I need something to do with my day\nShe like okay if you don't spend it all please bring it back in\nAnd you know how that story went I might as well threw it away\nEvery weekend I just pull up and go get that back in\nSomewhere for 5 to 15k and i just did 2 in a day\nImma keep on pulling up making them sick until they get blue in their face\nWith something new on my waist Rolex day pearl blue in her face\n\n[Hook]\nStarted from the bottom now i'm getting figures\nWay before this rap shit bitch i been that nigga\nAy, 16 fucking bitches 30 they can't get enough, cause\nWay before this rap shit bitch i been that nigga\nI know that they mad i see their temper tantrums\nWonder why i'm humble they can't understand it\nWhen i got them racks up i just rubber band em\nNigga now my momma live in a mini mansion\nAnd i'm at the top now and they still can't stand it\nThey know where i come from im a fucking bandit\nStarted from the bottom now i'm getting figures, but\nWay before this rap shit bitch i been that nigga"}]}
