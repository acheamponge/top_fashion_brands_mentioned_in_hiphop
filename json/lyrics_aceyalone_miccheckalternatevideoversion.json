{"songs": [{"lyrics": "If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all\n- a one two, a check a one two\nIf it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all\n- a check two, a mic a check two\nIf it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all\n- a one two, a check a one two\nIf it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all\n- a one two, and I'm a check you\n\nI start most of my raps off kinda slow\nJust so you could see exactly where it gonna go\nI make sure your body's strapped in\nCause I'mma tailspin and you're liable to get thrown\nThe bible is the microphone; I read from the scripture\nLeave it up to you to see the pictures\nI hover above MC's like a flying saucer\nWith the sorcery to alter the future\nPresent and the past, don't be hesitant to ask\nMe to be the man I'll be the last\nI'll be movin fast on that ass, I stipulate your fate\nI take a grip I'll take a shot I'll break your plates\nNow can you take the weight or do I have to make it lighter tighter\nThan you could imagine that I had to been when I recite a rhyme\nI might as well be inside of your mind\nI know you thinkin, \"Damn! How does he? What was he a man\nOr a machine with computerized diagrams?\"\nI tell em, \"Nope! I am of the flesh, fresh, dope\"\nI'm set apart you're just a shot in the dark\nAnd the darkness casts no shadow\nAnd I'll be victorious, no matter who I battle\nSo every rapper in the house shut the fuck up!\n\nCause if it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all\n- check one, check two\nIf it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all\n- check a one two check a one two\nIf it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all\n- a check one check two now I check you\n\nNow everyone knows I got the Milk like D, homemade quilt\nTo get your wig peelt, like it should be\nTop o' the mornin to ya, it's so many ways to do ya\nI offer you the shield, just before I deal on ya\nI recommend, that when I squeeze the puss from your skin\nYou pretend it ain't happenin\nCause everywhere is my stompin grounds\nWhen MC's stepped in I stomp em down to the lowest\nYou the slowest rapper that I met, but you owe us all a favor\nNot to, jet (nah you ain't goin nowhere)\nNot until you show us you be flippin\nI give your body lashes and whippins\nT crashes the board like Pippen, I has to be trippin\nNot for your pleasure or your entertainment I came with\nA crew called self, and everybody looked just like me\nAnd we agreed that we dope fool\nWe got flavor and everyone knows who's the saviour\nCause everyone knows, everyone knows\nEveryone knows I got flow\n\nAnd if it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all\n- a one two, a check a one two\nIf it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all\n- a check two, a mic a check two\nIf it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all\n- a one two, a check a one two\nIf it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all\n- a one two, and I'mma check you\n\n*Alternate last verse*\n\nYeah, peep this out, peep this out, peep this out...\nThis here's real life, right\nAnd we are fully animated, highly intelligent, original life forms\nLandin' in your leavin' (living) room\nNow back up from the tell-lie-vision I need breathin' room\nWe'll be leavin' soon on a runaway brain train\nSo sustain and seckle\nCuz wild game can't be tamed or tackled or shackled when I echo this mic check\nYou know that\nCan't hold back the blowed back when I flow that\nOoh, blew his wig back for tryin' to ride pig (piggy) back\nNow dig that\nI done slid back\nUsed my view finder\nI'mma give you a reminder\nI'm on the straight and narrow with no blinders\nNo blinders\nBut I still see the rhyme designers that bite like sidewinders\nWith ten toes down and I spin flows 'round and 'round\nOn an angle, with anger, the angular warlock-like strangler\nSociopathic, graphic\nPsycho symptom: drastic\nPlastic coated, bloated\nFatty tissue acid\nI'm Jurassic I unmask it with a bread basket full of mold and yeast\nThe stench is a clencher when the gases are released\nSo inhale\nCuz you know you know you inhale\nAs it is in heaven\nThis is to my sistren and my brethren and it goes\n\nIf it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all\nNow check one check two\nCheck one check two\nCheck one check two\n(fade out)", "title": "Mic Check (Alternate Video Version)", "album": "All Balls Don\u2019t Bounce Revisited", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5afdae8c12d9c72303cb15a766b901de.700x700x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
