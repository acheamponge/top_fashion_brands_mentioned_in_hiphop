How are you? \"\nHi .. Hi .. Hi .. Hello\nYou know I love them all\n\nStupid sick nasty ass drop\n\nNow I do not speak in her language, I see it in her eyes\nYeah I see it in her eyes, that she wants me in her life\nAnd though she will not understand it oh I can not say no lie\nShe's the Coca cola bottle shape to it to run di place are\n\nTurn around and come back again\nFuck me like it's - like it's revenge\nI'll twist your body round 'like a wrench\nScreamin' in the back of my benz, I sing again\n\nShe said\nHello Hello Hello\nHello Hello Hello. How are you? \"\nHi .. Hi .. Hi .. Hello\nYou know I love them all\n\nSecond stupid sick nasty ass drop"}], "artist": "Kent Jones"}
