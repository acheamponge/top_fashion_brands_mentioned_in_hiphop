Alright cool\n\nI'm here for the, fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers\nFor the guilty, the innocent citizens, and the immigrants\nIf you, ain't listen you're missin out\nBear witness to the realist style. (I bet they listenin now)\nIf my voice didn't work, but my hands could talk?\nWould you take the time to see what a deaf man thought?\nI could be alone and homeless\nHurt won't heal, but my cardboard's signed, so my words are real\nWould you stop to drop change? Or stop for a change?\nEngage in conversation, and exchange names?\nOr maybe you would listen if my image was a bitch?\nBig lips and bigger tits show you what real sex is. But?\nWhat if, I was picked for grave? Sick for days? Aged to be sick with aids?\nWould you listen to my story that I swear is touching\nOr just, blank stare cause you're scared to touch me?\nIf I'm, Jewish or Christian does it affect your decision to\nSee past religion and simply listen to wisdom?\nWould you, really listen to my views on the government\nIf my, raps were democrat and yours are republican?\nWhether I'm black or white, gay, straight, hermaphrodite\nHalf the time trash the light and we all act alike\nSo, pass the mic, don't assist being ignorant\nUnclench your fist for a bit and just listen", "year": null}]}
