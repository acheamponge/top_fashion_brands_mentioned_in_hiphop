We whoop walkin' across those\nSince a snot nose, from concrete my stock rose\nWhole lotta shootas when we squad up\nTalkin' burberry shoes, Big Tymers\nOr I got the hoody with the purple ape\nCup got the purple 8, hit it then I do the race\n\n[Hook]\nBRAZY!\nRunnin through the numbers watch it make 'em go, BRAZY!\nDiamonds always shinin' perfect time to go, BRAZY!\nPull up and we hop out and we make 'em go, BRAZY!\nMake 'em go, BRAZY!\nMake it look, BRAZY!\nRunnin through the numbers watch it make 'em go, BRAZY!\nDiamonds always shinin' perfect time to go, BRAZY!\nPull up and we hop out and we make it look, BRAZY!\nMake 'em go, BRAZY!\nMake it look, BRAZY!\n\n[Verse 2]\nLooney Gangsta Mack 11 what they call me\nCause I be out my mind when I be with the homies\n218 to 223 we let it loose\nNever copped a plea or made a truce, salute B.G.
