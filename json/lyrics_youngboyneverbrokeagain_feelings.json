I know they wanna give me ay\nWake up in the morning I ain't got nothin to eat\nI hadda man up and get on my feet\nI go to (?) to fuck with KD\nCan't even swim but I'm deep in that sea\nGot my first gun and I ain't spend a day\nSince I was young I been slangin that heat\nIt's some (?) motherfuckers on my street\nThink it's some monsters right on my street\nRemember they ain't give me shit when I have nothin\nThey want me stop but fuck these niggas I'm focused on money\nOn everythang she say she love me I know she ain't love me\n3three ain't round for him watch me I think feel somethin'\nMy mama told me stack my ends told me watch my homies\nBut I ain't listen Joe got shot and he told on me\nMy uncle told me that ain't right\nI don't need (?)\nCan't lose it all for somebody who ain't care about chu\n\n[Hook: Kodak Black]\nMy momma always told me about that water\nAnd I said okay mom I'mmma put my feet in\nI'm sorry mom I got right in that water\nI ain't ever noticed (?)\nLately I been workin over night\nI can't party on the weekend\nLike why the hell you even in my life\nTell me what's the real reason\nI pulled up, drive my seats in\nI'm catching flights you catching feelings\nMy diamond wet her pussy linkin'\nRan up a check and went to Nimens"}], "artist": "YoungBoy Never Broke Again"}
