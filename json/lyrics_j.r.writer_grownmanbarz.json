'Cuz I have an unblemished record. nobody has beat me. I have no flaws. I have no blemishes. But if you really stop and think about it, what would you expect? Ha Ha Ha\n\n(Hook)\nMy flow raw as the 80's\nSo retarded and crazy\nI'm so much of a legend\nLonzo Ball, never played me\nIts so hard to contain me\nMan that dog got the rabies\nTook a year off and I'm back with\nGrown man bars for the babies\nLately\nNiggas got a hate for the ace bone\nBut I'm gang gang with the same goons\nStill turned up and I'm flexin;\nFeel like King James in the weight room\nI never sweat it I'm fine\nYou'll never mess with my grind\nThat's 'cuz I'm always on time\nI'm in my amazon prime, Zeus\n\n(Verse One)\nYeah, I go to bed with the burner\nWho said the floodin' was over?\nWelcome to Hurricane Herma\nI give these bars to whoever\nPut all ya artist together\nI'm coming out swinging my arms\nTill it look like you've been sparred with McGreggor\nSlick rappin' with the best\nBut been blackin' on the rest\nYa street rep looking meek\nTalkin' Trick Daddy with the threats\nDrip swagger every step\nMcJagger couldn't test\nYou spitting back and caught a tech'\nDon't be gettin' nasty with the rep (WHOO!)\nGhetto never get respect\nI don't settle tryna stop a rebel I got medals of a vet\nI don't meddle with cadets\nI finished ordering a dish then I'm settling a check\nBen Baller of the ship, I'm on everybody neck\nHandling business, you couldn't handle the scrimmage\nHeard they be callin' me out, they must've ran out of minutes\nI used to gamble on Linux, dice in my hand 'till I'm finished\nPorsche with the trunk in the front, you gamble then you know that your family is in it\nI go live for the statue homicides in the capple\nBeams all up on the chopper, Spotify on the Apple\nI'm not the guy for the hassles, I optimize then get at you\nNiggas know I got the juice, when I arrive it's a Snapple\n\n(Hook)\nMy flow raw as the 80's\nSo retarded and crazy\nI'm so much of a legend\nLonzo Ball, never played me\nIts so hard to contain me\nMan that dog got the rabies\nTook a year off and I'm back with\nGrown man bars for the babies\nLately\nNiggas got a hate for the ace bone\nBut I'm gang gang with the same goons\nStill turned up and I'm flexin;\nFeel like King James in the weight room\nI never sweat it I'm fine\nYou'll never mess with my grind\nThat's 'cuz I'm always on time\nI'm in my amazon prime, Zeus"}], "artist": "J.R.
