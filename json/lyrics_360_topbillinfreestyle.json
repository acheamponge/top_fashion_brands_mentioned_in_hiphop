Seth's not famous man\nMost people know me from my Xbox gamer tag\nYeah, I heard he had a face like a one tonner\nWhy you think I put artwork on the front cover?\nSo if you got a friend that loves rhymin'\nI got a present, but with better darn prices\nEven if you're in a credit card crisis\nBuy the shit and I can get my car licence\n\n[Verse 2: 360]\nI don't even get scared in cemeteries\nYou get scared when you don't know where your teddy bear is\nI'm where it started, I'm everything that matters\nIf the Devil wears Prada then the Devil is a faggot, uh\nI\u2019m gettin' in it the minute I start rappin'\nI'll hit 'em with sarcasm and kick 'em and laugh at 'em\nIf you know some sick women, introduce me\nGirls love Matt Groening like Simpsons groupies\nBut I don't like having sexual intercourse\nI just like knowin' that my genitals fit in yours\nI'll send a message to Biggie Smalls\nI can't find my style yet, yeah, you get it? Then gimme yours\nI'll win awards for my next release\nBut won't thank no one in my acceptance speech\nAnd PEZ and me haven't sleep for weeks, Seth can see\nBut he'll never know if it's meth or speed\nTo calm me down, you better get some weed (weed)\nSo I can see time fly through my mind's eye\nAnd if you're talking about the highlights, you're talking about my rhymes\nTalk about the high life, talk about my life\nAt night time, I might just ride by\nSaying \"take your fuckin' watch off your wrist because it\u2019s my time\"\nI'm already high on life\nBut I get high on ice just to get twice as high\nWhen we're stepping on stage while you're reppin' your train lines\nWith fans that take time to get their Mexican wave right\nI\u2019ll have my Conchord with a built in squash court\nAnd still be complainin' that I want more\nAnd we about to go on tour with Tom York\nI know you've heard of us, wait \u2013 what\u2019s that song called?\nAnd while you\u2019re standin' in a circle kickin' frees\nWe're drivin' 'round a park in a perfect limousine\n\n[Verse 3: PEZ]\nUh, yeah, you might have heard of Six and me\nYo, it's Forthwrite bitch, the only surfers in the scene\nRockin' tight top shirts and fitted jeans\nListen close to this, it's the only verse you'll get for free\nOff one song man I'm earning fifty Gs\nWhile you want a punch on because you're turnin' fifty-three\nFuck the urban city dream\nGive me a house in a suburban little street, I prefer to live in peace\nI\u2019m killin' shit if you don't know by now\nYou better turn this off and go find out\nI'm not jokin' homie, turn this off and go right now\nIt's showtime, blow! I'm building up a buzz\nSo motherfuckin' big that it won't die down\nI'm the future, yes I'm in O-nine now and we the captains\nSee the weaker rappers keep adaptin'\nIt's easy you can speak to me or Three and see what happens\nI can't see the reason half you dudes are even rappin'\nYou're fuckin' terrible, I'm incomparable to most\n'Cause the flow's impeccable it's so\nIncredible now everybody knows\nI hear raw cliques talk shit about \"The Festival Song\"\nWhen they can't even comprehend the fuckin' level I'm on\nThey can't really even seem to ever pen a good song\nGo and listen to the rest of my songs\nAnd come back and we can talk, man I'm leadin' forward\nYou're just doing things I've already seen before\nSo I'm not listenin' to it or skippin' on through it\nI'm sick of gettin' shit and thinkin' this isn't music\nI hear these dudes still preachin' that keep it real shit\nYeah that's what you dudes do, you keep it real shit\nI begun, no wonder you people fear shit\nFuckin' hell, I can't even finish that shit\n\n[Verse 4: 360]\nFuck those cunts man, let 'em be, they're worthless\nA bunch of centipedes who would never reach the surface\nI'm sendin' dead MCs and enemies in hearses\nAnd dead in beef and every week and never leave the churches\nAnd say that 360's centimetre perfect\nBut even when I'm off by a centimetre, perfect\nAnd my initials are my destiny, get the letters M and C\nGet it, get it's meant to be I'm perfect\nAcclaim asked if I fuck heaps of fats\nThe fact is I lost count, fuck keepin' track\nMan, you're probably thinkin' what the fuck beat is that?\nBut make you forget the beat thinkin' fuck he can rap\nUh, remember the days of basketballin'?\nMan, I only rap for kicks 'cause I can't afford 'em\nAnd my sights are as high up as Michael Jordan\nOnly job I\u2019ll have in my life\u2019s performin'\nSee you talkin', see you in the afterlife son\nYou biting many styles 'cause it's hard to find one\nBut we have that after night fun with these hot tarts\nWe ain't rockstars but we party like some\nYeah, it seems these days, the topic's swagger\nCool now but don't rule out the subject matter\nStop rappin' I ain't wantin' to hear ya\n'Cause people love Sixty's music and ain't talkin' a era, no\nWe hit up rap with heaps of decent dimes\nWho like to lick their fingers just to read between the lines\nRubbing their gums while we're runnin' amok with more\nJunk in the trunk than a truck full of drugs to haul\nThis is do or die, it's either suicide or crucify\nYou decide, either way, you lose your life\nThere's a 360 crew but they're spelled different\nMy name has no letters in the alphabet\nI can smell success and man it smells like sex\nAnd so smell it\n\n[Verse 5: PEZ]\nYou know we're comin' live from Triple R\nTakin' Aussie rap music on a different path\nThe kid who spits the sickest bars like it isn't hard\nOn that breakthrough debut, sittin' in the charts\nAnother month, I'll be a bigger star than Jimmy Barnes\nIt's pretty simple, you don't like it, you can kiss my arse\nI'm out having rich dinners 'cause I'm livin' large\nYou're at home drinkin' Vic Bitter, tryna fix ya car\nIt's a laugh mate you try to call that hip-hop?\nShit, as soon as I turn it on, I just switch off\nEven if I just burn it, it's like I'm ripped off\nPeople probably heard it, that's why your shit flopped\n\n[Verse 6: Seth Sentry]\nI'm pretty certain I'm the laziest person I know\nI sit at home in the day with the curtains all closed\nJust burnin' a roach, watchin' Murder She Wrote\n'Cause I lost the remote and just search for it\nSo hard I'd rather sit and work for the show\nUntil it's over then it's Oprah? I prefer a good soap\nShit, I watch commercials and I purchase my phone\nAnd then return it after thirty days, dirty and broke\nI gotta leave these burgers alone\n'Cause I've almost outgrown the only shirt that I own\nPlus, I'm pretty sure that someone burgled my home\n(No) I swear I had a girlfriend and some furniture though?\nI'm broke dope rapper murder a flow\nBut it's so much work to go rehearse for a show\nShit, I used to do gigs and freestyle for two minutes\nLose interest and be home in bed before the tune finished\nIllusionist at work, I had it good\nJust stand in one spot at a job and try to look stressed\nYep, and that's the key to success\nSuccess sucks PEZ, I couldn't give a fuck less\nI'm feelin' the ceilin', I'm killin' these tracks\nI just write the punchlines and PEZ fills in the gaps\nPerhaps it's a fact that if I napped less\nI'd have more time to practice and get my raps fresh"}]}
