Because there\u2019s a magnificence and a moment that comes with fulfilling you dream that you can't achieve being a part of someone else's\n\n[Hook]\nFollow your dreams no matter what people may say\nThey gon' talk, they gon' front, they gon' hate\nAt the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes\n\nAll my dreams get knocked right back down\nTwo steps forward three steps back round\nThey keep pulling, I'm pushing, I'm shoving, they showing no love - God I need you right now\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou got famous, fell off, came back up, damn that's insane\nThe same as you must be to be in this game\nIn this game you suffer, hit strangers\nLike Usain you bolt towards your dream\nBut haters speak disdain\nKnow my name and your name\nBut one thing's for sure man\nSuccess is a sickness and there ain't no cure, man\nCure all is work hard and don't take no tours off\nAnd even on off days you can't act like you're off\nThe payoff is tenfold in dollars and euros\nPitfalls of vanity, pride, and your ego\nJust let go and live up to your full potential\nWhat they say is hearsay, it's inconsequential\nBut naysayers say no, but they are so simple\nThat they judge appearance and can't touch the mental\nThey are sheep, they follow shepherds and man\nI'm Malcolm, I'm Martin; I follow my plan\n\n[Hook]\nFollow your dreams no matter what people may say\nThey gon' talk, they gon' front, they gon' hate\nAt the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes\n\nAll my dreams get knocked right back down\nTwo steps forward three steps back round\nThey keep pulling, I'm pushing, I'm shoving, they showing no love - God I need you right now\n\n[Verse 2]\nDo it for family, but they don't believe\nThat dreams that you have can even be achieved\nGet ready young sailor, here's rough on these seas\nCan't let no doubt or self-pity drown me\nIt's design when you sign and the vultures appear\nAnd if you should succeed, then it's worse by the year\nBut the worse curse is failure, it kills by the day\nWatch your dreams and ambitions as they fade away\nSee, my curse is I'll verse in these verses I verse\nWill still be overlooked like a body in hearse\nBut this Lazarus rap and this is my rebirth\nThis is no pen, no paper, just my dream on verse\nThe boot lady told me she dreamed I was cursed\nTold her, if you can't tell I returned to Earth\nReturned to the dirt, returned to the essence\nCause no weapon formed that gives me a succession\n\n[Hook]\nFollow your dreams no matter what people may say\nThey gon' talk, they gon' front, they gon' hate\nAt the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes\n\nAll my dreams get knocked right back down\nTwo steps forward three steps back round\nThey keep pulling, I'm pushing, I'm shoving, they showing no love - God I need you right now\n\n[Outro, spoken]\n\nI hope you've learned about the business of chasing your dreams out there\nI hope you're chasing your dreams 'till you're exhausted, 'till your feet hurt, 'till your bones ache, and 'till you get it, you're hoping that you won't let it go\nI want this to be more than good music to you, I hope it's inspiration for you\nChad Butler told me a few years back, \"fight for your dream, Michael, like a drowning man fightin' for air.\"\n\n[Hook x2]\nFollow your dreams no matter what people may say\nThey gon' talk, they gon' front, they gon' hate\nAt the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes\n\nAll my dreams get knocked right back down\nTwo steps forward three steps back round\nThey keep pulling, I'm pushing, I'm shoving, they showing no love - God I need you right now"}]}
