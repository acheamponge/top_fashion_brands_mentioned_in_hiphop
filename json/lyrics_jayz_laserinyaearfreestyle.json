Minnow, the Titanic\nSend a distress signal like poof\nRed flares in the air don't matter to me\nSend the army, coast guard, the whole faculty\nI see and I raise you one, I raise guns like Bebe's kids\nThe Bad Boy but no I'm not Janice's, I'm Gloria's warrior\nWhen I flash the tool, leave you stiff like photographers\nY'all don't got heart for this art of war\nMy arsenal is more awesome than yours\nWhen Hov' in the building niggas lost from the door\nFrom the front porch 'cause I have no flaws\n\n[Chorus: Jay-Z]\nY'all keep acting like y'all don't hear\nI put this little red laser in your ear\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nNo rap, you rat, you wack, you bore me\nI wanna end your career but you gon' do it for me\nI'm, one of the greats\nYou know Young demand 'bout a hundred out the gate\nFor a flyer with my face (woo!)\nI'm like Mariah with the cake\nLord knows 'bout to retire with Mase\nAll my broads look like Mya in the waist\nAll over the country like Shania in the face\nI brought the pliers to the place\nTo apply pressure, I don't know how you gon' take\nNiggas acting like they flying with a cape\n'Til I bring 'em to Earth then they hiring the Jake\nMonkeys can't look the lion in the face\nThe king of the jungle, nigga, did I mumble?\n\n[Chorus: Jay-Z]\nY'all keep acting like y'all don't hear\nI put this little red laser in your ear\nI'm saying this slow so you clear\nI put this little red laser in your ear\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\n(Is he?)
