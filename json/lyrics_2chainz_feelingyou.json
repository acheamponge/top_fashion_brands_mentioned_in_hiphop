I'm spiritual\nShe ask me what I'm finna do I say get into you\nOne leg up followed by the other\nGet a little head then I find a rubber\nWe don't talk on the phone - we Tiger text\nThat mean she send a few flicks and I send a check\nYou 'memba Shonda, the one that had a Honda\nGood head on her, you can learn a lot from her\n\n[Chorus]\n2-hour long conversations on the phone, can't get you outta my mind\nBaby are you feeling me, feeling you...\nEverything you say and everything you do gets me lost in you days at a time\nTell me are you feeling me, feeling you... 2 Chaaaiinzz\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn the a.m. I think about her fragrance\nWhen she met me I made her change all her statements\nNot what she say... but what she bank\nAnd how she think... I can't complain\nOn to the next one pro-gression\nKeep the past and the present, separate\nI got alotta spots like a leopard\nOne to trap in, one to have sex in\nOne to stack in, one to get dressed in\nI'm getting married Ben Franklin my best man\n3 cell phones she got all the numbers\nI told her right then it was all or nothing\nYeah I'm on that loud I know you heard of me\nHair-weave killer, emergency\nHair-weave killer, I murder weaves\nHair-weave killer, murder scene\n\n[Chorus]\n2-hour long conversations on the phone, can't get you outta my mind\nBaby are you feeling me, feeling you...\nEverything you say and everything you do gets me lost in you days at a time\nTell me are you feeling me, feeling you... 2 Chaaaiinzz"}], "artist": "2 Chainz"}
