they claimin they \"G\"\nSo bump this beat cuz it's real, just change your air change the station\nWatch the story bout hatin', then another bout bassin'\nI'm takin' riches to get it, but now I'm sick of this shit\nSo with these last couple of dollars, we gone flip it legit\nI bought this beat machine, bout big as a calculator\nWho would have ever dreamed we hit the studio later\nIts like I owe them bassers, for making me take this serious\nWasn't for the struggle cuz, you would not be hearin' this\nIn the mist I'm frisked bout three times a day\nWhat I'm doing down here, nigga this where I stay\nI just pray, that I relay, the message to some\nAnd let them know, goddamn, ain't no more play where I'm from\n\n[Chorus: Pastor Troy (voices in background) 2x]\nMy nigga fuck what ya say (We
