{"songs": [{"lyrics": "Red eyes, car tires, late nights\nPretty women, my main guys, late flights\nLiving through my days like this ain't life\nDreams I can't lose so you know I press snooze twice\nFocused on survival\nWhile I get my cake because the game a vicious cycle\nGoing for the title, respected by my idols\nLiving by the Bible now, so they calling me a psycho\nSee, that's why I say the world's iffy\nThoughts move through swiftly while I'm breaking down this fifty\nAnd I'm screaming \"free Mike, Ness, and Spiffy\"\nTil they let my niggas free or the lord come and get me\nIt's just the way I'm feeling\nI see these clown niggas slipping\nBut my lil bro tell me they all banana peeling\nOn the top chilling\nWaking up in a young actress' loft\nAll the windows from the floor to ceiling\nRolling weed as I rise from my sleep\nConstant reminders why I find her a freak is what follows\nAnd no matter, stripper, actress, or a model\nGuarantee you by the end of that bottle they all swallow, fool", "album": "Caveman Files", "year": "2011-03-15", "title": "Shut the Blinds", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8364eac38f8e9f936d9169b02883e6b0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Da$H"}
