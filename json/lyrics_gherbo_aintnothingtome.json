Run it up anyway\nAnd I been in the streets and I made enemies\nCan't get rid of what's pendin' to me\nNo Limit, we been right at east\nDream team boy, I've been MVP\nAnd that's prolly why they envy me\nI know niggas hatin', I see that they fakin'\nI read it in they body language\nThey ain't gangsta for real, they ain't ready to kill\nI can read it in they body language\nAnd I got it on me, it don't matter beef, run up on me, leave your body stankin'\nHit them all, I got blood on my Masons\nAll this money is makin' me feel like I changed, thinkin' bout back in the days\nWhen I used to feel like I could stay in the hood, get my money, and still be the same\nBut I'm still with the gang, just tryna stay in my lane and I move like a boss now\nMy whole family look up to me and I know if I fuck up it's only my loss now\n\n[Hook]\nI don't know what's becoming of me\nAll this money been coming to me\nI've been changing my ways, thought money wasn't gon' do nothing to me\nYeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me\nYeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me\nYeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me\nI've been changing my ways, thought money wasn't gon' do nothing to me\nYeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me"}]}
