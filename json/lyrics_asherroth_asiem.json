Must I be more convincing?\nY'all talk all ya want, never halt me from my mission\nUse it as ammunition, would you please keep dissing me?\n(All Day Long) I hear it (All Day Long)\nAnd yeah the haters wanna hate me cause I made it and I'm famous\nBut until you take my place, you'll never know bout what it takes\nTo make a record for respect, take a second to inspect\nWhen you look like someone else, then what the fuck do you expect?\nI just want to be accepted as the illest in the game\nBut it's harder for an artist creating his own lane\nThat's synonymous with rhyming and combined with perfect timing\nOn the time I got left declining and bout to explode so hold on\n\n[Chorus: D.A.]\nTake me as I am, my friends, ain't gonna change, won't be no end\nWrite these songs, rock these shows, only good life I know\nTake me as I am, my friends, ain't gonna change, won't be no end\nWrite these songs, rock these shows, only good life I know\n\n[Verse 3: Asher Roth]\nSo fuck it, that's all I've got, there's nothing else for me to say\nIf I don't confront the problem, then it will never go away\nUnless it is addressed, there is nothing left for me to do\nIt's impossible rejecting an elephant in the room\nSay goodbye to all the bullshit, notions pre-conceived\nSo long to all the blogs, coulda sworn they knew me\nIf you have no further questions and can't think of other thoughts\nThen I'd like to introduce you to Asher Paul Roth, dawg\n\n[Chorus: D.A.]\nTake me as I am, my friends, ain't gonna change, won't be no end\nWrite these songs, rock these shows, only good life I know\nTake me as I am, my friends, ain't gonna change, won't be no end\nWrite these songs, rock these shows, only good life I know", "year": "2009-04-20"}]}
