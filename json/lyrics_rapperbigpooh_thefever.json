So fresh\nJam like Def, respirate me please\nI'll break brainstorms, ink, poison and trees\nHe's in the zone and your deed can't stop him\nI bet you with his eyes closed, he can still drop 'em\nPop 'em from behind the ark\nSend a piece up to Pete with a pound of my heart, c'mon\n\n[Hook: 4X]\n\n[Rapper Big Pooh]\nSomebody send him a prayer, I swear\nCause this is the year we gon' get it however\nAnd even by myself, LB together\nPrepare for any weather, ponchos official\nCity slick with the best, locked, confidential\nRecord rock solid just like prudential\nDho got the resume so fuck credentials\nScoring parts with words when it come to the pencil\nThey couldn't get it right if I lent 'em a stencil\nI ain't really tryna offend you\nBut between you and I, we both know the truth\nPooh a pyromaniac when it come to the booth\nFresh squeezed juice right down to the pulp\nKeep a smile on my face while them haters sulk\nSee the green in your mug like Incredible Hulk\nFeeble so go correct your talk\nI got the remedy"}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
