Kelly piss on your kids\nHere's the ultimatum mothafucka\nGive me that *ASCAP*\nOr give America Biggie and 2Pac flashbacks\nSome niggas don't think the Underground is grimy and dirty\n'Til they find your body on a fucking highway in Jersey\nI fire rockets at generic topics\nYour lyrics don't hold weight\nLike two-dimensional objects\nCause jail culture didn't give you that fitted hat\nTo memorize a ghostwritten shit verse and spit it back\nI won't let your wack rhymes redefine lyricism\nFor a whole generation with their fathers in prison\nYou live inside the image of an Era that's gone\nLike government officials trying to justify Vietnam\nI'll leave niggas traumatized like they momma died\nAnd they was responsible for the driveby homicide\nAnd I don't market revolution, I live it\nWhat you think cause you fake everyone else is a gimmick\nJealous bickering, industry slaves, the nerve of you\nLike a child prostitute born into a life of servitude\nUntil we murder you making the red carpet burgundy\nThe Psycho Realm and the streets were I prefer to be\n\n[Hook: Immortal Technique]\nHollywood Driveby, motherfucking murderfest\nWeed clouds in the air that cause turbulence\n'Revolution' motherfucka you heard of it\nI light the spliff with the flag while Im burning it\nHollywood Driveby, spraying the cucarachas\nWar with the system like the streets of Oaxaca\nYea 'Revolution' motherfucka yea you scared of it\nWell its coming to the industry now so be prepared for it\n\n[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]\nYou're on some bullshit tracks I spit them full clip raps\nWhile most of these 'gangsta rappers' are some full fledge rats\nThe real Gs stay strapped in full combat\nWhat you see in the videos is full on acts\nThe streets don't believe you homie\nArmaggeddon in the rap game is coming and we lead the army\nRock 'Terror Tape' out of your sounds\nGot hostages in pink, this is what they call hip hop now\nI keep that metro shit out of my whip\nMan that dummy rap is thru, making money is about to extinct\nYou know the radio is trying to kill rap with that shit\nThe only thing dying is the DJs when the K spit\nWe'll hit his CEOs and blow up A&Rs\nIm taking your chips like crashing your game of cards\nThis is how I eat holmes I will give you bars\nAnd take the life of these stars for the state of ours\n\n[Hook: Immortal Technique]\nHollywood Driveby, motherfucking murderfest\nWeed clouds in the air that cause turbulence\n'Revolution' motherfucka you heard of it\nI light the spliff with the flag while Im burning it\nHollywood Driveby, spraying the cucarachas\nWar with the system like the streets of Oaxaca\nYea 'Revolution' motherfucka yea you scared of it\nWell its coming to the industry now so be prepared for it\n\n[Verse 3: Sick Symphonies]\nIm from the city of fallen stars the home of bangin hard\nWaitin for them at the Radio City Hall to snatch em out their fuckin cars\nExpose em for what they are: narcs, jakes, snake informants\nFeeding us horse shit, blaze up all of them\nThey say hip hop doesn't exist\nRappers talking hard dressed up like punk rock kids\nPumped up by some corporate endorsement dead corpses are voiceless\nNo one hears ya homie, ya little fame is over\nWe'll send little homies for closer like bankers cuz you owe us the mortgage\nFor exploiting the lifestyle that many died, jailed up for storage\nLeaving most of us hopeless homies radio focused\nWhat we're building got em all afraid\nGimme the K I'll be honored to ignite the flame\nThat'll burn down the game, whats fame?
