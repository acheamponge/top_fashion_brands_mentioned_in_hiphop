I'm a believer\n\nSome might know me as a rapper some might know me as a southern dude\nOthers as a black man, but first I got another crew\nEver since I heard the Gospel message how the Son was bruised, I got a new identity, it's like your boy's another dude\nWe ain't undercover brother, come and see us trust the Truths that we stand under brother, other things adjust and move\nSome say we dumb for trusting Christ, they say we just some fools, but you can check His grave if you want it proved, ooh\nWe ain't perfect at all nah\nWe recognize this life's hard\nThe difference is instead of drowning, we trust the Life Guard\nWe fight hard, but with the right perspective as we walk this\nChrist, He works in us like an office, so I'm a believer\n\nI'm a believer\nI'm a believer no doubt\nI'm a believer yeah\nI'm a believer hear me out\nI'm a believer yeah\nI'm a believer yeah yeah\n\nSo in the end, hey this is me\nI ain't that cat that you seen on TV\nI ain't that rapper, model, actor, baller, none of them defines me\nI'm a believer, known to the One that exist in three\nCo-heir to the kingdom, this means I'm the King's son, partner, that's what defines me\nIdentity \u2013 crucified, choose to die, now the life that I live, not I\nBut it's this flesh, He laid to rest, through faith, I live by Christ\nI'm quite sure your mama told you not to trust just anybody\nBut tell me who is like the Lord? Not anybody\nI took a look at Him in the Scriptures, this really got me\nHe keeps His promises, even though cats be living sloppy\nLook at His love, and His grace, and His just mercy\nI was dirty, till I trusted Him who's trustworthy\n\nI'm a believer\nI'm a believer no doubt\nI'm a believer yeah\nI'm a believer hear me out\nI'm a believer yeah\nI'm a believer yeah yeah"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
