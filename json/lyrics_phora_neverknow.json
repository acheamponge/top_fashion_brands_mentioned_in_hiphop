I will probably never know (Never know)\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I don\u2019t wanna waste time, you know I was there for you\nEven though it takes time, you know that I cared for\nIf you needed anything, I would take the fall for you\nCould\u2019ve been my everything, could\u2019ve gave it all to you\nWould\u2019ve gave it all to you", "year": "2019-07-26"}]}
