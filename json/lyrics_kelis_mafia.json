What?\n\n[Verse 2: Kelis]\nDeath to a soft heart\nThat's what I vow to you\nThe vows I vow to you\nAmazing how it's true\nTalk goes on our phone\nJust to remind you\nThat I'm behind you\nThe FEDS won't find you\n\n[Chorus: Kelis]\nRelax my love\nThe love I have for you is like the Mafia\nFor you I'd testify\nI'd lie for you of course\nSince my love is like the Mafia\nAnd for you I will fight\n\n[Verse 3: Markita]\nMister and Misses, but I wonder where the bliss is\nSealed in blood and Cordion kisses\nThe shit I witnessed\nWould give a bitch morning sickness\nDecomposed bodies thrown in the ditches\nAs for snitches ain't nothing lower than that\nIntentions to squeal on your fam make you low as a rat\nGot cappos for flaming at those\nLame ass hoes, so you know next time keep your trap close\n\n[Verse 4: Kelis]\nWhat would you doubt for?\nI'd never lie to you\nOf course I'd die for you\nI'd be your eye for you\nMy love rest assured\nI'll raise our sons for you\nI'll save our ones for you\nLoad up your guns for you\n\n[Chorus: Kelis]\nRelax my love\nThe love I have for you is like the Mafia\nFor you I'd testify\nI'd lie for you of course\nSince my love is like the Mafia\nAnd for you I will fight\n\n[Verse 5: Markita]\nRiches, tradition niggas once held dear\nLet it be known that your name alone spell fear\nGun for gun, hundred to one forget about it\nPetty shit, rise above and get up out it\nCould give a shit about it\nTime to focus a foe\nMany lives bought and sold\nFortunes favor the bold\nConnected like phone lines\nTo racketeering to known crimes\nWinners turning long shots to gold mines\n\n[Verse 6: Kelis]\nThe high speed chases\nI'll do them just like you\nI'll give them dust like you\nTurn around and bust like you\nThen I'll deserve it\nEvery time I get high\n\n[Chorus: Kelis]\nRelax my love\nThe love I have for you is like the Mafia\nFor you I'd testify\nI'd lie for you of course\nSince my love is like the Mafia\nAnd for you I will fight\n\n[Outro: Kelis]\nYou I testify, oh, oh"}], "artist": "Kelis"}
