I wrapped it up and sent it\nWith a note saying, \"I love you,\" and I meant it\nNow, I know what a fool I've been\nBut if you kissed me right now\nI know you'd fool me again\n\n[Chorus]\nLast Christmas, I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day you gave it away\nThis year, to save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special\nLast Christmas, I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day you gave it away\nThis year, to save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special\nGave it away, to someone special\n\n[Verse 2]\nA crowded room, friends with tired eyes\nI'm hiding from you, and your soul of ice\nMy God, I thought you were someone to rely on\nMe? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on\nA face on a lover with a fire in his heart\nA man under cover but you tore me apart\nNow, I've found a real love you'll never fool me again\n\n[Chorus]\nLast Christmas, I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day you gave it away\nThis year, to save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special\nLast Christmas, I gave you my heart\nBut the very next day you gave it away\nThis year, to save me from tears\nI'll give it to someone special\nA face on a lover with a fire in his heart\nA man under cover but you tore him apart\nMaybe next year I'll give it to someone\nI'll give it to someone special\nSomeone special\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, yeah, to someone special\nYeah, yeah, to someone special\nWoah, oh, gonna give it to someone special, yeah", "title": "Last Christmas", "album": "Christmas Funk"}], "artist": "Aloe Blacc"}
