You be rocking nicer shoes than him\nI?m in the spot with some juice and gin\nCome to me\nYou?re a beauty with your Louis and Gucci\nBaby girl I don?t wanna be your man, but let me just write my number on your hand\nAt the party with a whole buncha hunnies here\nYou got yours laced up with some bunny ears but now I got you all alone and the boozes gone So slip outta your clothes but keep them shoes on\n\n[Chorus]\nYou looking like fresh, like WOAH!\nGot damn, Looking so fly that you probably got a man\nYour looking right and he ain't here tonight so?\nI won?t tell him if you don?t OHHH!\nSo let?s roll?.roll back to the crib\nGrey Goose lights dimmed Girl that?s how I live\nYou know you got them kicks fatt ass and some lips\nBaby you ain't gotta ask for a kiss\nShawty look proper with kicks like Foot Locker\nAll done up, she a good shopper\nNew jeans, blue tee and her shoes clean\nLooking like she about to seduce me\nJust touch me, tease me girl caress it\n100 thousand pairs in your shoe collection\nI know you like to tell, but let me just lay back while you light my L\n\n[Chorus]", "year": null, "album": null, "title": "Fly in Her Nikes (feat.
