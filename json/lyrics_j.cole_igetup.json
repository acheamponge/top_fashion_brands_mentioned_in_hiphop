Cole]\n\n[Verse 1]\nI woke up early in the morning, hoes blowing up my phone\nI ain't used to small talking when they know I'm tryna bone\nFuck 'em, I'll holla later, man, right now, my mind's elsewhere\nMy mom's healthcare, get her out this hell here\nA lot of niggas fail, frail niggas won't prevail here\nWe seen it all man, niggas can't even spell scared\nA Fresh Prince, but yo my city ain't no Bel-Air\nFuck if you would sell, I'm worry bout my welfares\nSo farewell to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid\nSoon as my dough straight, I throw the wifey in some Dolce\nAnd put some chains on my niggas like I own slaves\nI get up, look out the window, hope the sun shining\nDown on my niggas out there front lining\nI hit the streets and see them boys out there locking up some older head\nSo Goddamn homie, hold your head, and hold your head\n\n[Hook]\nI get up, I see the clouds from my window\nI pray the sun gon' shine this way\nAnd where I go as the wind blow\nMomma, your son gon' find his way\nAnd if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though\nAnd to the top I'ma climb my way\nAnd tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my\u2014headed for the sky\nI'm on my way\n\n[Verse 2]\nPaint a picture to show the deaf what it's like to listen\nAnd speak the words and tell a blind man what he missin'\nFor all my niggas doin' time man up in prison\nFelt you had to resort to crime, man fuck the system\nWe raisin' babies up in Hades where there ain't no hope\nAin't no fathers, don't take no scholarship to slang no dope\nPoliticians hollerin' bout problems but I ain't gon' vote\nHe talk about change, still we floatin' in the same ol' boat\nSo tell me how I'm supposed to feel when the President spoke\nWhen he ain't never had to struggle, ain't never been broke\nAin't even roll through the ghetto ain't neva been close\nTrustin' this government's like trustin' the devil in oath\nFor rebel with quotes, I get up\nLifestyle of the young, black and reckless\nA generation of niggas strapped and askin' questions like:\n\"Tell me why I ain't got shit?\"\nI let this liquor fill my liver with them toxics as I sip\n\n[Hook]\nI get up, I see the clouds from my window\nI pray the sun gon' shine this way\nAnd where I go as the wind blow\nMomma, your son gon' find his way\nAnd if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though\nAnd to the top I'ma climb my way\nAnd tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my\u2014headed for the sky\nI'm on my way\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, to all my niggas paper chasin', I pray for your patience\nJust keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cakin'\nTakin this shit one step at a time, that real shit is stuck on my mind\nBut to that bullshit I'm deaf and I'm blind\nDestined to shine I'mma find a way, cause hey\nDamn it, them jobs out there ain't tryna pay, I pray\nGranted nine to five is how you survive\nI ain't tryna survive, I'm tryna throw my Momma in rides\nI'mma provide for my seed I'm the soil\nI'll teach 'em bout' loyalty\nI'll teach 'em that his skin black like oil that's for royalty\nI'll show 'em all the things that my pops was never showin' me\nTreat 'em like a growin' tree with this poetry\nI get up and show the sons how to lead not to follow\nThe present is our gift but our seed's got tommorow\nSo please niggas raise your kids\nAnd help em' overcome that bull shit they daze us with\nI blaze the shit\n\n[Hook]\nI get up, I see the clouds from my window\nI pray the sun gon' shine this way\nAnd where I go as the wind blow\nMomma, your son gon' find his way\nAnd if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though\nAnd to the top I'ma climb my way\nAnd tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my\u2014headed for the sky\nI'm on my way\nI get up, I see the clouds from my window\nI pray the sun gon' shine this way\nAnd where I go as the wind blow\nMomma, your son gon' find his way\nAnd if I gotta crawl, I'ma make to the end though\nAnd to the top I'ma climb my way\nAnd tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my\u2014headed for the sky\nI'm on my way"}], "artist": "J.
