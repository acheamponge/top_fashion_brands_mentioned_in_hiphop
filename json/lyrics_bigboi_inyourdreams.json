Pow! Lay fuck down now\nNo, no, don't try to talk your way out\nBecause I\u2019m usually non-violent, positively vibing\nBut every now and then, you got a nigga wanna try you\nWhy? I don't know, I don't even understand it\nBut it's simply overstood, how you really suppose to handle it\nPardon me one moment: I just went off on a tangent\n*Laughs*\n\n[Hook: Janelle Monae, (Sleepy Brown)]\nWe spend summer dreaming\nWhen we coulda be leaving\n(Out here wildin', don't give a fuck)\n(See you when the sun come up)\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\n(Out here wildin', don't give a fuck)\n(See you when the sun come up)\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\n\n[Verse 2: Killer Mike]\nTypical day off in the A [aye]\nBut nicks on the Chevrolet, [aye]\nNigga wanna rob okay, [okay]\nWay stand his where he lay, [aye]\nKeep looking at me what, a gangsta grill\nAnd I'mma give your ass, a gangsta\u2019s pill\nThat\u2019s a little piece of lead, taken to the head\nThat nigga ain\u2019t live, that nigga there dead\nTaken dirt naps, sleeping with the fishes\nDone like dishes, It\u2019s a wrap like Christmas\nBig Boi you said a word, I\u2019ll make these niggas dreams a nightmare\nI will bust there motherfucker head\n*Laughs*\n\n[Hook: Janelle Monae, (Sleepy Brown)]\nWe spend summer dreaming\nWhen we coulda be leaving\n(Out here wildin', don't give a fuck)\n(See you when the sun come up)\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\n(Out here wildin', don't give a fuck)\n(See you when the sun come up)\nI guess I'll catch you in your dreams\n\n[Bridge: Sleepy Brown]\nWe ridin', killin', feelin', straight chillin'\nOut here wildin' don't give a fuck, see you when the sun come up\nWe roastin', boastin', flowin', straight coastin'\nOut here wildin' don't give a fuck see you when the sun come up\nAs the wheels: Keep spinnin', we grinnin', billin', straight pimpin'\nOut here wildin' don't give a fuck see you when the sun come up\nNow we knowin\u2019, holdin', showin', controllin'\nOut here wildin' don't give a fuck see you when the sun come up\n\n[Hook Janelle Monae (Sleepy Brown]\nWe spend summer dreaming when we coulda be leaving [Whoo]\n(Out here wildin' don't give a fuck)\n(See you when the sun come up)\nI guess I\u2019ll catch you in your dreams\nI guess I\u2019ll catch you in your dreams\n(Out here wildin' don't give a fuck)\n(See you when the sun come up)\nI guess I\u2019ll catch you in your dreams\n\n[Outro: Janelle Monae]\nI guess I\u2019ll catch you in your dreams\n[Fade]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6ab5c816aabfeaaf6d9419aff7e1e84c.1000x563x1.jpg", "year": null, "title": "In Your Dreams", "album": null}]}
