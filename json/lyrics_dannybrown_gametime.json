Get the fuck up out of here\nIt's game time, it's game time\nDawg you got another square? Get the fuck up out of here\nIt's game time, it's game time\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's like that, you know it's like that\nNumber 10 white Jordans with the grey and black\nWhen I attack they need more than a ice pack\nIf you come back and fuck around and have an eye patch\nThis rap shit is more than my hobby\nBut iller than a convict who killed for one\nBlowing blunts with my nigga and we still ain't done\nSmack any motherfucker who says hustling's fun\nTrying to chill from going nuts\nPlanning to get piff while listening to Donuts\n(?) hold up, bitch nigga run it\nKick it in your stomach like you've got a baby in it\nWhy you so timid? I'm ready for action\nBumping Electric Relaxation what's happening?\nWhat's with all the hating?\n\n[Hook]\nDawg you got another square? Get the fuck up out of here\nIt's game time, it's game time\nDawg you got another square? Get the fuck up out of here\nIt's game time, it's game time", "year": "2010-03-08"}], "artist": "Danny Brown"}
