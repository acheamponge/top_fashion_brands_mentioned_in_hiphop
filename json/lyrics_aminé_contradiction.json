By Jahosh]\n\n[Intro]\nYou see every heart breaks breaks when it wants to\nAnd when you break that heart\nThat heart never wants to\nLove again\nSo she singin'\n\n[Hook]\nWhy can't you want me like the other boys do?\nThey stare at me while I stare at you\nWhy can't I keep you safe as my own?\nOne moment I have you the next you are gone\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou wonder why I'm so selfish\nAnd why I never reply to your texts\nIs it because I'm still attached to my exes\nGirl you're fine but you're so damn restless\nAnd she got an axe with a fat ass\nShe kill a nigga quicker anytime that she can\nI wanna to be alone\nShe wanna be a hoe\nYou broke my heart in seconds\nAnd now you want it when I'm gone\nI tell her like\nBaby you the bombest\nYou can get it\nBut I don't want it (I don't want it)\nSo now you singing\n\n[Hook]\nWhy can't you want me like the other boys do?\nThey stare at me while I stare at you\nWhy can't I keep you safe as my own?\nOne moment I have you the next you are gone\n\n[Verse 2]\nAttention, Attention\nThat's what every girl and they momma wanna mention\nGirl you're so fine, girl you're so fine\nBut, I'd never tell you that cause I never wanna sweat ya\nPop it with the pop again\nAnd pop it if you want to pop it\nThinking every bop in a nigga\nPopular is your only goal\nI tell her what I need when I want\nAnd if you really want me shawty\nWe can get it on\nBaby you the bombest\nYou can get it\nBut I don't want it\nSo now you singing\n\n[Hook]\nWhy can't you want me like the other boys do?\nThey stare at me while I stare at you\nWhy can't I keep you safe as my own?\nOne moment I have you the next you are gone"}]}
