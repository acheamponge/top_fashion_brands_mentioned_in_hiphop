Competition dearly departed\nThey feeling some sort of way 'cuz my flow revealing the garbage\nI'm making 'em throw it up. You just making the people vomit\nWhen it comes to this rhymin' I\u2019m a legend like Tutankhamun,\nOr the Chupacabra, the way I weave it together and tie the knot up\nMade a macram\u00e9 of macabre, you daquiri with a shot of\nThe Amarretta, you\u2019re sweet as a girly drink\nThrow it back, cognac, I'm the best, you know that\nYou can have your own opinion, but not your own facts\nOn track as the most prolific ever, the most consistently\nViciously off the rip, we be rippin' it like a shredder\nSome symphony hall shit, gettin' higher than your falsetto,\nGetting better. Drop a pearl every jam like Eddie Vedder\nVery fed up with self appointed preservers of past eras\nWho never see their reflection when they\u2019re walking past mirrors\nThey got bitten and now they smitten with the taste of blood\nThey take enough drugs for the sleepin' they weepin' and fuckin' they make-up up\nI raise the bar and the waiters up\nAll this hate is just confused unadulterated love\nThe eyes are the window to the souls and my shades is up\nAdvocate for artists, regardless cause I got faith in us\nFor the workers who don\u2019t get paid enough\nTake the bus, hands way too rough for the paper cuts\nAs far as they\u2019re concerned food on the table's the only way to love\nIt takes a slum village to raise a child, you got to raise it up\nRaise it up, raise it up,raise it up, take it up, take it up"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
