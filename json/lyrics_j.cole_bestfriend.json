Cole]\nNow, now, now, know we be arguing\nBut ain't you riding with me\nWe breaking up we making up\nLike Dwayne Wayne and Whitley\nYou throw things, you broke things\nUse both hands and hit me\nAnd right when you call the law\nI\u2019ll tell my boy to come get me\nThen you, than you start listening\nTo friends, and then it, gets tricky\nThey try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky\nSo you ignore the hickeys, the pics of chicks in they vicky\u2019s\nThat they sent me, is that real love\nYou\u2019re the only one that I will love\nDamn, damn\n\n[Bridge]\nMy best friend says\nI can stay with her\nAt her house, no doubt, anytime I like\nMy best friend says\nDon't let you in my life cause you don't do for me and you don't act right\nMy best friend says\nIf she was me, she would let you go a long, long time ago\nMy best friend says, my best friend says\n\n[Hook: J. Cole, Aaliyah, & Missy Elliot]\nI\u2019ll still be there for you\nIn time of need\nYou can lean on me\nCome on, come on\nI\u2019ll be there for you\nI\u2019ll be there for you\nIn time of need\nYou can lean on me\nCome on, come on\nI\u2019ll be there for you\n\n[Verse 3: J. Cole]\nGirl I can see it in your eyes\nHow you feeling, let me know whats on your mind\nWe\u2019ve been together for a long long time\nHey, girl I can see it in your eyes\nI know to you it feel like I\u2019m never around\nRound, round, round\nBut if you leave, who else gon hold me down\nHey, hey, hey, hey"}], "artist": "J.
