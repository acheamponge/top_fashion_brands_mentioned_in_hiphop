Cthulhu's come:\nLet Earth abhor this thing\nLet every mind prepare for doom\nAs anguish and woe he'll bring\nAs anguish and woe he'll bring\nAs anguish and woe he'll bring\n\nUp from the sea, R'lyeh did rise:\nThe cultists awestruck dumb\nWith ancient rites so wretched and perverse\nCthulhu's time has come\nCthulhu's time has come\nCthulhu's time has come\n\nDeath to the world! Cthulhu reigns\nThe Great Old Ones Destroy\n\nWith wrath and doom, so cruel and foul\nReplete with obscene joy\nReplete with obscene joy\nReplete with obscene joy\n\nHe rules the Earth with dreadful might\nAnd through our ghastly dreams\nHis twisting turning tentacles\nElicit from us maddened screams\nCthulhu's time has come\nCthulhu's time has come\nCthulhu's time has come", "title": "Death To The World", "album": "Jobe Bells", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cbf547b02e6ae10281fb97d2b3ef6dd6.300x300x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Afroman"}
