Crazier than ape shit\nShit, never want you to fake it but every once in a while I deserve to dick you down\nI put the papers on the permit\nI could\u2019ve blow it on a thorny young K town\nMight\u2019ve been worth it\n\n[Chorus]\nHow come we don\u2019t touch?\nWhere\u2019s our love, am I what you want?\nI recall it might be my fault\nIt\u2019s never too hard\nI wanna breathe\n\n[Verse 2]\nI\u2019m getting careless now\nFuck around and caught me texting these bitches\nI ain\u2019t had sex in a minute\nFlirting, fucking the mind is like the closest thing I get to have to intercourse this time\nAnd of course I wanna stay true but I\u2019m battling it, I just hope you can handle it\n\u2018Cause honestly I\u2019ll never know another\nI don\u2019t even wanna fathom me, just wanna touch\nLet me give you massage, you know I\u2019m nicer with palms, too hard?\nOk, I do it soft, hold it, baby, you stressed, just cool off\nYou need some wine or something?\nYou need some soft lights?\nCan I rub some chamomile lotion on your mosquito bites?\nAnything that\u2019ll give me, sending me to the light\nI keep the faith that one day that you just might\nJust might, just might\n\n[Chorus]\nHow come we don\u2019t touch?\nWhere\u2019s our love, am I what you want?\nI recall it might be my fault\nIt\u2019s never too hard\nI wanna breathe"}]}
