Everybody knows it\nThem man are lucky, I never had the strap\nBecause I swear to God, I would empty the whole clip\nI'm like [?] fully loaded\nMost man in the game lost it, they eroded\nI'm Roman, I'm E3 area-coded\nAnd I didn't flop in the game like Jerome did\n\n[Interlude]\nYou get me?\nHold tight the whole game\nHalf of them don't even know what they're doing but guess what?\nGood, you know why?\nYou know why?\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou see the level I'm on, you wouldn't last long\nBecause I'm on the moon like Neil Armstrong\nI was the first one, I be the last one\nYou're too lazy, wanna be a star in the hood\nCome and ask one\nBut it's like, really, sitting in the top\nEverybody wanna try and pull a fast one\nSo I step off the top spot, once I'm advised from a legend\nI wrote this bar at midnight 07, January first\nI learnt to drive manually first\nMe and my sound, we were angry first\nIf shots were getting buss, I'm like \"can we first?\"\nUsed to like school but I kept getting kicked out\nWhat about music? Bring a few hits out\nI got it in me, mum died, brother too\nPlus I don't wanna be the one who missed out\n\n[Outro]\nEskiboy\nClass of 07\nEskiboy\nYou know me (You know me)\nHello\n(Run up on your girl quick)\nNasty", "image": "https://images.genius.com/de7dec0da580e6983af1849e89114aef.583x583x1.jpg", "album": "Umbrella Vol 1", "title": "Class of \u201907"}]}
