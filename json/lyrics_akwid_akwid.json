I'm always put to shame\nSo if you let me in your world, I promise I will Change\n\n*[Verse:]: There's no doubt no question, on what you been doing for years\nCorrupt both of our worlds, now you livin in tears\nYou cried you my only one, look me dead in the eye\nWhat a fool to believe, girl for you I would die\nThought I found my one and only girl\nTo share my life, and share my World\nSecond guessing on myself, never cross the line\nNever once doubt in you, try to play my mind\nThe best things always come in twos\nBut after this one time, I couldn't stick around, cuz of the wicked way you choose\nThough you were my baby boo\nThe time came around to represent on what a man had to do\nSwirvin, weaving, hid beneath this section\nFuck all the drama never should I have to mention\nBut just incase you wanna really take a swirl\nDon't trust nobody when it comes to my world\n\n~Chorus~\n\n*[Verse 2:]: For just once I got a hold of my world\nThere's no more drama\nNo more sad or slow songs and drama about no girl\nI shifted out a foo and hit the breaks quick\nAnd thinking \"Damn i coulda been there with this chick\"\n(It's crazy) girlfirend don't care care if vatos think she's stuck\nShe was getting down with Anthony and Chuck\n(and for this chick?) life was nothing but an all day party she was livin\nAnd I couldn't get up in it, and if I did (guess what?)\nThen id be like the next man found fighting\nWhen I found that they're pounding on your back\nAnd its still the same, but you claim things change\nTryna blame me for your games. (Please)\nIt's all cool baby it's nobodys fault but mine\nFor goin on a ride on cloud nine\nI coulda gave you my whole world then\nBut I'd probably be sharing it with them\n\n~Chorus~\n\n2x: Nobody's gonna shape my world &\nNobody's gonna make my world &\nNobody's gonna break my world &\nNobody's gonna take my world\n\n*Verse3: The truth lies in the soul not to save the lease\nThere's noone to blame cuz the pain is in the beast\nYou know right from wrong\nSo stop holding on\nLook on the brightside\nYou're fortunate to be in my song\nThere's no exception, don't question what I believe\nIt's all good, till you tangled up the way I believe\nWith our heart and soul, and a mind of gold\nThere will never be another like you in my world\nYou still lookin at me sideways (why?) cuz I just sang my sad song\nAnd you still can't believe I'm gone\nBut you know I really understand, it's hard to swallow what I said\nWhen I think about the lies you fed\nAnd it ain't all bad, it's actually all good\nKnowing that I did what I could (for real)\nYou shouldn't let it get you down and blue\nThink I'm dedicating this song to you (You feel me?)\n\n~Chorus~", "title": "Akwid", "album": "Los Aguacates de Jiquilpan"}], "artist": "Akwid"}
