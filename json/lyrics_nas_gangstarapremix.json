We saw that last week, of course, in Brooklyn, with the tragedy over there, and then again last night, another police shooting.\"\n\"Here's what they think about you!\"\n\"I hate motherfuckers like you. You niggas ain't shit! Think you tough, huh? I could blow your head off with the Smith and Wesson and you couldn't do shit! How you feel now?\""}], "artist": "Nas"}
