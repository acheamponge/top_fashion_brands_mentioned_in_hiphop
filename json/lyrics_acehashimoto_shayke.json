That fly shit, that shit that the fly did\nThey telling me I'm losing it, but I ain't trying to find it\nRunning laps around you niggas, I ain't trying to time it\nReally, I'm just talking, coincidentally, it's rhyming\nI seen the hands of fate, hmm, I'm in\nNow do what I say like Simon or get maimed like a lion\nDrinks is on the house, hell, I'm buying\nI found this credit card outside\nAnd it ain't mine, so why not?\nLupe's new pupils getting big, give me some eye drop\nWhoa, did you not just hear that rhyme that I just dropped?\nGo back and listen to that, like, 20 times\nI got plenty rhymes\nI did this in six hours, imagine what\nI'll do for volume three, February is the release\nSo go and cop it when I drop that shit\nI'll get the toilets stopped up\nBitch\n\n[Outro: brandUn DeShay]\nMan, fucking 4:30 in the morning\nI'm having too much fun right now\nAnd I... did I not mention that I produce?\nSo it's not just the rapping shit\nEverything is easy\nI swear, I was born to do this\nAnd on that note...", "year": "2009-12-25", "album": "Your Favorite!
