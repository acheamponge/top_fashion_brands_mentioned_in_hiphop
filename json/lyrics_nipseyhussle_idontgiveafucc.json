"[Chorus]\nI don't give a fuck\nRide with my burner and my beat turned up\nAC blowin' and my window down\nChunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town\nI don't give a fuck\nRide with my burner and my beat turned up\nAC blowin' and my window down\nChunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town\n\n[Verse 1]\nLook, my mama wanna know why I'm bangin'\nShe told me I'ma lose my life\nI ain't trippin', I'm a crip and I'ma do it right\n'Fore I run from a nigga I'll lose the fight\nI gotta hustle, Mama, I'ma move the white\nIf I died and came back I'd do it twice\nBrainwashed by the block, it consumed my life\nCool nigga but a killa when the mood is right\nBullets have the dogs howlin' at the moon at night\nMama, it's cold outside, ain't no hope outside\nCouple niggas gettin' money, most is broke outside\nRocks in the house, sellin' dope outside\nReminiscin' on my niggas that got smoked outside\nSuckas in the house when them locs outside\nHustla gotta eat when them folks outside\nGot a burner on my lap and I'm dippin' in my bucket\nLife's a bitch, nigga, fuck it!\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't give a fuck\nRide with my burner and my beat turned up\nAC blowin' and my window down\nChunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town\nI don't give a fuck\nRide with my burner and my beat turned up\nAC blowin' and my window down\nChunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town\n\n[Verse 2]\nChyeah, they say we probably die slangin', bangin', pressin' the line\nAll a nigga really got is my respect and my pride\nGot a chopper for the coppers, keep a TEC in the ride\nEvery nigga got a limit, never step on the line\nWhen the set say it's on I'm expected to ride\nWhen the world say I'm on I got the set on my side\nMatter fact a nigga got the set on my back\nSlauson boy, the world ain't ready for that\nNigga, it's cold in my hood, ain't no hope in my hood\nCouple homies couldn't cope, smokin' dope in my hood\nBut I could never ever be from no other hood\nAnd I could never ever leave my folks in the hood\nThank the Lord every morning that I woke in the hood\nAnd summers that I rode chrome spokes in the hood\nIf I never sold a mil' off what I wrote in my hood\nI ain't trippin' 'cause niggas know I spoke for my hood\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't give a fuck\nRide with my burner and my beat turned up\nAC blowin' and my window down\nChunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town\nI don't give a fuck\nRide with my burner and my beat turned up\nAC blowin' and my window down\nChunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town\n\n\"Bigger Than Life\" (Starts at 4:20)\n\n[Intro: Nipsey Hussle]\nWhat up?\nWhat it do?\nMusic Corner\nI'd like to welcome everybody out tonight\nWelcome all the new marathon members\nTo the experience of a lifetime\nI need your hands up though\nYeah, look\n\n[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]\nI don't want your love, it\u2019s not why I make music\nI owe myself, I told myself back then that I would do this\nAnd I always look so out of reach, it just seems so confusin'\nThat I felt my place in life, a young black man, it's seems so useless\nBut I don\u2019t want no help, just let me suffer through this\nThe world would not know Jesus Christ if there was never Judas\nThis knife that's in my back'll be the the truth that introduced us\nAnd the distance in between us is the proof of my conclusion\nSo life is what you make it, I hope you make a movement\nHope your opportunity survives the opportunist\nHopin' as you walk across the sand you see my shoe print\nAnd you follow 'til it change your life, it\u2019s all an evolution\nAnd I hope you find your passion 'cause I found mine in this music\nBut I hope it\u2019s not material 'cause that\u2019s all an illusion\nAnd they all in collusion\nThis racist institution double standard\nActin' like they not the reason we ruthless\nBut tonight\n\n[Chorus: June Summers & Nipsey Hussle]\nTonight is my night, this is my moment\nFeelin' bigger than life but I gotta own it\nIt's a victory\nLet's make history\nDon't judge me by my progress\nLook\n\n[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]\nLook at where I started and look at where I\u2019m standin'\nY\u2019all can say it's luck but I know that it's plannin'\nShout out to the pain that gave me understandin'\nShout out to my gang, it turned me to a savage\nSo niggas could say what they want to but I go through what you haven\u2019t\nBut it\u2019s not ego driven, it\u2019s not me boastin' and braggin'\nThis road I chose to go down, hard to slow down when in traffic\nIn order for me to grow, I had to let go of some habits\nAnd it's easy to say I\u2019m on now 'cause you see it, and it happened\nBut before it ever did, I had to believe and get it crackin'\nSo I\u2019m gon' take you back then, 32 shots and my MAC-10\nWith a dream minus the means, my early teens was fuckin' tragic\nAnd deep inside my mind is buried crimes you can\u2019t imagine\nThat I wrestle with at night, demons that I fight I can\u2019t get past it\nSo no matter how straight your cash get, it don\u2019t matter if you plastic\nWe was lookin' for the lights and all we stumbled 'cross was flashes\nBut tonight\n\n[Chorus: June Summers]\nTonight is my night, this is my moment\nFeelin' bigger than life but I gotta own it\nIt's a victory\nLet's make history\n\n[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]\nSo if it\u2019s meant, then it\u2019s gon' be\nPeople love it 'cause they know that this the real me\nThe cops hate it, so they hope my homies kill me\nBut I ain't want the fame, I just wanted y\u2019all to feel me\nIt\u2019s my time so I\u2019m goin' in\nWe ball 'til we fall, fuck how the story ends\nI see these niggas hatin\u2019, I know you hoes plottin'\nI ain't worried 'bout it 'cause I know God got me (Got me)\nGot me (Got me)\nGot me (Got me)\nSay I know God got me (Got me)\nGot me (Got me)\nGot me (Got me)\nYeah, I know God got me (Got me)\nGot me (Got me)\nGot me (Got me)\nYeah, I know God got me\nSee, I ain't worried 'bout it\n'Cause I know God got me (Got me)\nGot me (Got me)\nGot me (Got me)\n\n[Break: Nipsey Hussle]\nOnce in a lifetime shit, you know?\nThis song dedicated to everybody out there with a muthafuckin' dream\nFuck what they say, do your shit\n\n[Chorus: June Summers & Nipsey Hussle]\nTonight is my night (Marathon, nigga)\nThis is my moment (This shit ain't gon' stop til' I say it's gon' stop)\n(It ain't  gon' stop 'til you say it's gon' stop)\nFeelin' bigger than life\n(And it ain't gon' be unless you make it)\nBut I gotta own it\n(It's your time, get up off your ass)\nA victory (10 toes down you here)\n(I swear to God I shed tears in this booth, nigga)\nLet's make history\n\n[Outro: Nipsey Hussle]\nFor my niggas that's gone\nFor my niggas that can't be here with me\nFor the ones that is\nShout out my beautiful little girl Emani\nShout out my big bro Black Sam\nShout out my nigga Fats\nShout out my bro Adam\nShout out my A and Bs\nYou know what this is, it's the motherfuckin' marathon\nAnd this shit ain't gon' stop, man\nOne hundred (One hundred, one hundred, one hundred)"}],
