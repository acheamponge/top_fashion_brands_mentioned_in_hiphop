I'll give you an example:\n\nYou talked about professionalism\nBut what does professionalism have to do with a real exchange\nYou are as professional as you have to be right now\nYou are as professional as you need to be\nYour sincerity has offended me in any way\nIt hasn't confused or complicated things\nIf anything it's broken down and made the environment more comfortable for everyone else\nWhat did it do, what was the cost of your lack of professionalsim, your so called lack of professionalism, because I don't call it that\nI believe a world can exist on honesty, I just do, you know. I'm a believer"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
