A lot was said when I wrote \"All for You\"\nAnd every feeling I expressed, it was true\nWe have no ideas what emotions really do\n'cause they pinned up inside 'fore they take control of you\nBut, I just know I'm a better man now\nRegardless of the fact how it all went down\nPlus me and your relationship is on solid ground\nYour boy better off simply havin you around\nFrom man to man talks, and man to man guidance\nFatherly advice REAL man be providin\nNo analyzin where we are in our development\nAppreciatin times spent with the other one\nAnticipatin for the day that I have a son\nSo I can tell him what we been through\nIt don't matter where I'm goin, where I'm at, or where I'm into\nYou much more than my kin, you\nYou much more than my friend who, wish me nuttin but success\nAnd it's that I'ma hand you\nAm I ending this with love? Yeah, I plan to\nPop, I think I finally understand you, f'real\n\n[Chorus]:\nI just want you to know, that your always close to me I feel you holdin me\nIn the world still moldin me, I know you proud on your face I see\nYou can smile pop (You can smile pop)\nI just want you to know, that your always close to me I feel you holdin me\nIn the world still moldin me, I know you proud on your face I see\nYou can smile"}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
