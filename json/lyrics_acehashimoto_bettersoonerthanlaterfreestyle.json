It\u2019s not dictionary\nI seen it, then I dreamed it like it\u2019s Pictionary\nForgot it, I had to find it inside of my mind\nCouldn\u2019t recall like star sixty-nine, it\u2019s fine\nFar from powerful, but [?]\nThe weakest in the room often speaks the loudest\nThey used to say that my beats was crowded\nSix bars ago, I was the prince, but now he\u2019s crowned it\nKind of sounding like it wasn\u2019t a word\nBut I couldn\u2019t do what I do if I wasn\u2019t a verb\nHip hop the caged bird and y\u2019all couldn\u2019t make it sing\nThe wings ain\u2019t make you fly and the crown ain\u2019t make you king\nAnd that brown would make you seem like the ish\nBut I\u2019m all about the real and y'all all about the dealing\nNo longer making tracks or making love, so tell me how it feel\nSo tell me how it feel\n\n[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]\nA J Dilla fan\nGot dope like the dealer man\nGot green like the dealer man\nI\u2019m off this like dealer man\nI\u2019m spinning like ceiling fans\nNo homo like Killa Cam\nI\u2019m feeling this feeling, man\nIt feels great\nI feel like they can\u2019t hate, they can\u2019t touch me\nThe MC Hammer that\u2019s not rusty\nMichael Vick, I\u2019m hawk, a stick that can\u2019t rush me\nWalk around the mall with a chick that\u2019s so busty\nShe hot, so they acting up, they mad as uff\nPlus my flow is like an aqueduct\nIf y\u2019all ain\u2019t notice something, I\u2019m from the Chi\nBut I\u2019m so far from the Chi, I\u2019m more closer to modest\nPlus all of the hoes, see I\u2019m the hottest\nBut that don\u2019t mean nothing, I\u2019m in a Cavalier\nWith a chick that\u2019s bad as Hell\nShe\u2019s riding shotty like she the cartridges\nI\u2019m on top of the game like the cartridges\nShe a love fool like the Cardigans\nI told her it\u2019s over and now she say she want to start again\nBut I don\u2019t sweat her like a Cardigan\nHeaven or Hell, I wear it well\nI'm ill\nI\u2019m ill\nBillionaire, yeah", "year": "2008-08-26", "album": "Volume: One!
