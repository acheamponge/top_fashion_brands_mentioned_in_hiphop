Are you keeping focus?\nAre you Moses? Are you why I'm inside of this swarm of locusts?\nAnd if so, can you walk on the red seas\nAnd see into the dark and make it light again, please, please, please\nPrince of Egypt prince of Persia prince of Paris\nYou\u2019re the prince of Champagne and sunnin' on the terrace\nYou\u2019re the prince of bubble bath, the crush i have is terrifying\nSuffer but i bear it, I know love will tear us\nApart\nAgain\nCuz you\u2019re nailing me to the wall, you shackle me like a slave\nI\u2019m failing I feel you fall of the back of me like a wave\nLike an impala so fast on the interstate\nI\u2019m mad that you say you\u2019ll call but you bastard, you make me wait\nI pissed on you like a mastiff, you\u2019re the hydrant\nRaise your mast with my flag on it like a pirate\nI\u2019m a good girl with a masters in wasting time\nAnd I feel like the pearl being cast among all the swine\nBut the sky turned light blue when we were inside\nAnd I don\u2019t mind, you say to spend the night-\nToo late, cuz the sky\u2019s already light blue"}]}
