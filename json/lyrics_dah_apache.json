{"songs": [{"lyrics": "Young nigga rolling cold, word to King James\nLooking for me? pictures prolly on your bitch page\nI wake up every day, schemes to get paid, get made\nI been the fucking man since the fifth grade\nForever faded, young Jimmy Rothstein\nIn a dark Caeser speeding and my speakers loud as my reefer Chiefing, leaving a permanent smell off in the car\nNah, this ain't that bag weed, I get mine in a jar\nAnd it taste so good that I don't usually do cigars\nJust papers, but on this occasion I have no patience\nCause after we finish blazing baby my dick meeting your jaws\nAnd I hope you give a performance worthy of an applause\nPause, or did you get it? shorty no hands\nName is D-A-DOLLA, never was a Ronny Romance\nLiving too fast, never learned how to slow dance\nAnd my cousins told me money be the only time you hold hands\nDamn", "album": "Caveman Files", "year": "2011-03-15", "title": "Apache", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8364eac38f8e9f936d9169b02883e6b0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Da$H"}
