(Yo, what the fuck is this nigga)?\nGive up the ghost. (Shit, niggas can't even get it on nowadays)\nNiggas probably think we crazy up in this motherfucker, ha ha ha\nI got my mob up in this motherfucker. (My cousins fightin cousins)\nOh and they ready for war\nLet me hear my regime, make some motherfucking noise\nIt's a war going on in the universe against good and evil\n(Crowd Roars)\nNiggas don't give a fuck out here, boy\nIt's a war going on out here, you ain't knowing\nCan I smoke, smoke? Can I smoke?\nI tell you, it's a war going on out here\nIt's good and evil man\nThat's my camouflage, motherfucker\nYou boys is off the hook\n\n(Bizzy Rapping)\nIt's a war going on and my dogs is raw\nNigga look in your rearview and tell me what you saw\nI see this bulletproof nigga with his hand on his gun\nI said nigga, you push the gas and somebody run\nWe all scatter from the chit chat bang\nYou think I'm high nigga, you got me fucked up\nI'm looking through your eyes nigga\nAnd I'm tough as fuck, coughing daily\nNigga, look the same popped comet coming at you\nWho's gonna stop it? I say we dropping these hits\nStraight platinum, can you hack it?\nHell yeah, I'm been rapping since you was going on, what's happening?\nRun DMC, can you walk this way?\nHell naw nigga, but I can sure pull my pistol and pop you\nStupid motherfucker"}], "artist": "Bizzy Bone"}
