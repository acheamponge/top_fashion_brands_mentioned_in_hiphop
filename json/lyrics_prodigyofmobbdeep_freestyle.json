They lost one\nFelt down the side of my forearm was wet\nAww shit, take the pain and bleed\nEmergency'll call the D's\nGrab the Codeine and swallow half the bottle\nGet treatment out in Long Island, tomorrow\n\nDedicated to K.B. and Yambo, the Scarface Twin\nTo all my niggas that won\u2019t think twice to sacrifice your precious life\nWord up! My nighttime niggas, during the sun\u2019s hour, keep your head up\nNigga, what? Word up!\nMy true-to-life thunns\nYeah\u2026", "year": null}]}
