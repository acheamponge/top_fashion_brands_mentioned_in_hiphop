It\u2019s really messing me up\nI got a brand new nephew in about a year\nHis lungs will be older than he is from the cloudy air\nNot saying cloudy like the molecules of H20\nI\u2019m talking about the factories and fumes, whatever you know\nAnd every time I\u2019m driving, I\u2019m thinking \"I\u2019m such a culo!\"\nMy contribution of pollution isn\u2019t very cool though\nBut what am I to do though? I got to work to live\nAnd if I happen to be living where my working is\nThen will I ever learn to celebrate it through my kids\nOne day I\u2019ll have 'em maybe but first I need a lady\nAnd will I give her all my time and will she really love me\nAnd will she give me shelter when the storms are up above me\nI know sometimes it be my personality is ugly\nAnd no amount of make up can make up for that\nBut know I recognize a game and when I\u2019m up to bat\nI\u2019m gonna put a little change into the thinking cap\nBecause to change the world you gotta change your mind\nWe can\u2019t go on living wrong inside of the same design\nIt gotta be that you and me agree to make a difference\nPut up a canvas and manipulate the color pigments\nTo paint a portrait of tomorrow full of broader figments\nIn your imagination could you imagine nations?\nAt peace and harmony instead of genocidal warring\nWhere borders don\u2019t exist and nobody\u2019s considered foreign\nMother Earth is respected, animals are protected\nSociety perfected, Capitalism's rejected\nWhat is the world coming to? Almost the end of us\nAnd it\u2019s the evils in the world today we tend to trust\nHow could we let the ashes crumble till they come to dust\nI guess that\u2019s what is meant to happen if you blind enough\nIf you ready for what is coming, then come on with me\nFollow my voice, if you can hear it let the song lift me\nInto the graces of Heaven\u2019s hugs, to learn love\u2019s embrace\nAnd share with every beautiful face\nI place my right hand on my heart\nAnd say, let me be the start\nI pound my fist on my chest and request\nAllow me to be the test, and when I\u2019m at my best\nI can make a Catholic priest confess\nCause guilt is worse than the parasite in his flesh\nAnd the flesh is weak but the pride is strong\nAnd it can make a little lie last a little bit longer\nThan it was ever intended by whom ever intended to send it\nWatch the evil manifest that it rendered\nAnd I hope you remembered your place in this\nLook up at a shooting star, go 'head and make a wish\nHopefully it will be granted by the gods\nAgainst all odds you\u2019ll be wise enough to see through the facades\nWhat is the world coming to? I wish I had a answer\nBetter than seeing human beings as a living cancer\nBetter than being what I\u2019m seeing hope I have a chance to\nRaise the consciousness\nPeace ya\u2019ll and god bless\n\n[Echoes]\nBlind World", "title": "Blind World", "album": "Now-Again Re:Sounds (Vol. 1)"}], "artist": "Aloe Blacc"}
