Thought the same\nOnly few was taught to get this, divorce the game\nVisualized as a young cat, saw the dream\nGet large, shit hard, and assorted CREAM\nSo many came that I saw and went wise on my ways\nMade livin for me more intense, divided my days\nWeekends, party nights, raffled the stakes\nLove sophisticated women, those that rather you wait\nTipped it off from the finest juice to 90 proof\nRocked it all, from designer suits to climbin boots\nAll in the summertime, workin the courts\nLookin mommy wit them thick legs, hurtin them shorts\nSo many ladies in the world today searchin for mates\nGot these non-players perpin for dates, hold up\nGive me love if you've got it in ya, hot as Virginia\nHot enough for me to slide this up in ya\n\n[Hook] x2\n\nGot the solar, Nat King Cole in his prime\nSo behold that, shoes unfold in each rhyme\nMove accordin like the Chosen Ones roamin the Earth\nGetting head until I'm dead, decomposed in the dirt\nPlay the same spot, bitch cast, lost it all\nRollin dice and G you're better, now you forced to ball\nHavin fun at the main event, toastin cups\nQuarter pieces tryin to get yours roastin up\nPlay the game if you got toys to match your words\nYou a vet, throw your net, nigga, catch some birds\nOnly a few left, still sincere, spread love\nThank God, it's a heaven above, talk to me\n\nHook to fade", "year": "1998-03-26"}]}
