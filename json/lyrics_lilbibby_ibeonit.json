Slaughter my opponent\nHomie where the cash at? Yeah I got to have that\nIf money getting low I found out where yo stash at\nCuffin' these hoes man that's where you went bad at\nYou probably get laughed at cause everybody smashed that\nIn the Benz truck tryna stack my M's up\nBillion dollar dreams fuck I need a friend for?\nI just threw a couple grand up in Pin Ups\nOwn it all night, yeah I gotta get my ends up\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Lil Bibby"}
