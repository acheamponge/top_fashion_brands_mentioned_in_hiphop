Me losin'? Y'all niggas must be buggin\nWe can battle for ten minutes and let your cousins be the judges\nI'm the illest rapper to come out thus far\nI'll shoot anybody; even the bitch who gave me CPR\nStep to the Outz' and end up getting burned\nFuck around and get raped like one of Bill Clinton's interns\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI'll shove a gun in ya grill, greasy and heated\nSmothered in hot mustard, so when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it (eat this)\nYou need to be immediately treated\nWhile you breathin' and you'll be leavin' the receivin' room this evenin' with Jesus\nYou hate on us and we'll be waitin' on eight corners\nSwarmin' ya hood with a thousand angry skateboarders (c'mon)\nI hop in a Jeep, slam on the gas and charge you\nAnd bombard you in the car that your mom bought you\nFuck around and get choked and found in a moat\nFloatin' around drowned, face down in a boat (damn)\nI'll pile five dudes in a Pinto and pull up\nTo the 7 Mile drive-through at McDonald's and pile-drive you\nI got the power to snatch a motherfucker out of his car\nWhen he rides by me at ninety miles an hour\nThis place is my house, I might as well erase my face\nWith white out, 'cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows\n\n[Verse 3: Fuzz Scoota]\nI'm dressed to please sucking nips\nYeah, she get it the same way that I fucked the chick\nStuck my hands in her panties like bitch suck my dick\n87 freak 187 heat the passion rolls I'm passin' clothes\nYou like it in the ass is what I'm askin' hoes\nAren't you Fuzz he has sold more albums then the Jacksons sold\nI love you baby if I'm not with you then I'm blastin' foes\nTelepathically harrasing foes\nI know your little sister is fourteen but her ass can grow\nIce-berg took down Titanic elastical\nGiven my fans the exact shit they askin' fo'\nFuzz Scooter fucking one man bout to show\nYou passing one blunt bitch we passing four\nI rode your ass and smoked take one pull and smoke your head up\nI'll send you to tell 2Pac to keep his head up\nI went to the fighting really Canibus who can get up\nI knew this shit was over from the fucking blood that he spit up\nRan a couple more miles should have done more sit-ups\nI want his dumb ass to jump up bitch and get lit up\nCall your bitch like, \"Bitch, come and pick this bitch up\"\nOn battle you be sweeter then I get this shit up\nI'll stomp you too you get up\nOr stomp you to the cops come\nEighty nigga's came when your fucking block got dumb\n\n[Chorus: Fuzz Scoota]\nTrife thieves, we can't be trusted\nSteppin' to my clique the wrong way and get yo' motherfuckin' dome busted\nWe got cement shoes for all you damn snitches\nWe ain't just shootin' niggas, we fuckin' bitches\nTrife thieves, we can't be trusted\nSteppin' to my clique the wrong way and get yo' motherfuckin' dome busted\nWe got cement shoes for all you damn snitches\nWe ain't just shootin' niggas, we fuckin' bitches"}], "artist": "Bizarre"}
