Roosevelt]\n\n[?]\n\n[Chorus: Amir Obe]\n[?]\nYou ain\u2019t gotta ask me who I\u2019m cool with\nYou see the facade we all maneuver through\nKarma got me thinkin' what I\u2019ll do to you\n\n[Verse 3: Amir Obe]\nI ain\u2019t tryin' to [?] for life\n[?] at the hills gon' take my life\nSwore to god I wouldn\u2019t jinx myself\nSomethin' about her made me rethink myself\nBest conversation with the voice in my head\nTellin' me to go before the yellow turns red\nFight in public and rejoice in the bed\nApologize and forget what I said\nSaid she hate that I\u2019m a Virgo\nOnly worried about the work flow\nIn the penthouse with the fur coat\nI get vertigo I\u2019m gonna keep the curtains closed\nYou just focused on the view\nYou need to focus on you\n\n[Outro]"}]}
