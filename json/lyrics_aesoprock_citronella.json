{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Intro]\nI stood before the glittery borders of new radius\nIn search of the fabled city of mud and crushed velvet\nWhat I found was a gutter where the love of entertainment\nMeets the lust for blood and demerits\n\n[Verse 1]\nCutters of the pie throw your summers in the sky\nCollar-pop Jolly Roger die motherfucker die\nApache on a ship shape, in Bristol fashion\nSnuck a jammy through the red tape and tiptoed past him\nWorm teeth grinding feverishly below\nAs little organic hacksaws eager to feed and grow\nSo when it's Blackhawk over the glass walk\nThey surface up through the cash crops\nWith clippers for your belly-up mascots and never dine alone\nMeanwhile, back at sea level, it was home by home zone for zone\nBloom County's homeless riot for home ownership\nI hope you put gas in the motor-home and know the roads\nI studied with the finest combs stuck under my thumb\nAs opposed to the loaded nose who pray Armageddon is numb\nAnd that's unevenly rendered\nTo those who grew up thinking faith was a surrender of reason\nBut not a reason to surrender\nCatch the Liberty Fire's catalog\nForty torched orchids and citronella for Algernon\nDon and Vagabond alike repent\nThis shit should have been Beta burns Babylon, the end\n\n[Hook]\nAnd when the radio stars climbed up out of the floors\nTo murder the medium that shot 'em thirty years before\nThey said\nKill television\nKill television\nKill television\nDifficult isn't it\nAnd when the cutters of the pie throw their summers in the sky\nNo love lost baby, the future is so bright\nKill television\nKill television\nKill television\nDifficult isn't it\n\n[Verse 2]\nNothing says charm like an armored car\nTaking the clone-farm 'tards to the arms bazaar\nWe were the homemade marker makers born to pour the marsh ink into right guard parts\nAnd march through the gauntlet of car alarms\nNo harps, no delusions of losing with something prettier\nThan ash around the metacarpal still clutching the teddy bears\nBut we can run with scissors through the city fair\nOr situate the nuzzle with the subtle art of splitting hairs\nDouble park the shuttle, some will arc the funneled cutty sark\nWhere budding narcs target the gushing heart in the muddy Clarks\nThese are the vices of the p-noid bastards\nWho will chew whatever tablets blur the axioms fastest\nBut crews lose lunches by the hundreds\nLose electricity, lose gas, phone, plumbing\nHumming keep your mouth closed\nKeep your cows cloned, go\nI am the pulse of this fucking town homes know\nMy what a convenient embargo\nAt least I'll always know which side of the gun I'm supposed to buy the farm from\nThe too-far-gone kicks, still in the box\nFix, still in the pill in his sock\nChilling, gill in the slop and a million watch Gideon scribes\nBut once the arc honor pussy and bribes, the animals will divide\nAnd that's a win for the garish who keep charity in the parish\nWhile profiting off the lack of a marriage amongst the classes\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe mobile infantry is so postal\nCoast into the quotient provoking the local Pistol Pete\nChoking his liberty and justice quotas and cloaking his folk in smithereens\nSmokey little pile of bloody pulp and co-dependencies\nDopey, no surrender, bender in effect\nSole defenders of the longest night New York had never slept\nAnd there were jumping jacks and whistlers over Christmas\nLike Rockets From The Crypt spilling the festive morning beverage of your preference\nI step in Hog Heaven, stony, with no weapons\nPissing on teleprompters, selling megaphones to hecklers\nWho broadcast eighty million versions of the sermon\nFor that one indisputable masterpiece before the curtains\nPale, Arcadian moon, high-definition, flat plasma\nIMAX, city-wide transfer\nArtificial Einstein-Rosen out the tenement\nEase into the Xanadu, let it hammer the tension out\nI'm talking cool, calm, dominant phenomenal\nMonitor face to the wall opposite\nU.F.O.'s and locusts sing the same old song\nWhile the Weathermen get retarded as the day is long\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Citronella", "album": "None Shall Pass", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3d6c4d11084714cc67f880d71310d197.288x288x1.jpg", "year": "2007-08-28"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
