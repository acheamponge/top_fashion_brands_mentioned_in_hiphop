Everything dead\nI\u2019m Akala\nCos my dad\u2019s black, I fool the whole world\nLike Obama\nThey really think I care about life, nah you\u2019re mad\nI murk everything on the dance done you\u2019re sad\nI had, quite a good time\nAnd spat, quite a good rhyme\nCos mine\u2019s, quite a good mind\nFor time, mic would shine\nSublime, bring who you could find\nCousins don\u2019t worry us\nIt\u2019s not school, we are grown men\nWell some of us\nTrouble us, bless you\nSweet heart you\u2019re special\nSuck it up, don\u2019t show pain, it\u2019s just a flesh wound\nTest whom? Don\u2019t do it to yourself\nThat\u2019s just disaster\nLike an honest third world leader in private planes that are chartered\nYou are not a martyr if you die for no reason\nCos you look like food, and we were hunting this season\nHigh treason to a royal emcee\nIs when you mimic me\nI am the metaphor and you are just a simile", "year": null, "album": "Sixteen 16's", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d63d64df777a3ef536fe94251e324962.1000x563x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
