Kelly]\nFunny faces is all I see\nAt my place, you on top of me\nPlayin' strip poker, sippin' Cristi'\nI grip your shoulders, you sqeeze the sheets\nI'm admirin' your heart shaped booty\nNothin' in your oven, baby feed me now\nWho's is this, who's is this, who's is this?\nWho's is this, who's is this, who's is this?\nMy ghetto queen\n\n[Chorus: R. Kelly]\nYou're my ghetto queen\nRight around the way from me\nWatering those ghetto trees\nWe be high just like them weeds\n\n[Verse 2: Crucial Conflict]\nMight be ghetto but you queen to me\nThat's how it's suppose to be\nDo whatcha gotta do for me\nForever fulfill your fantasy\nWhen you think of me, have your cream\nEverything my team must to do one thing\nYou're the meanest queen on the scene\nMake a player 'fien and be havin' dreams\nFor real, it's real as it seems\nYou bring the trees, I'll bring the B's\nBegin to freeze on to me, you can scream to please\nPlus I'm ready now, take a stand, got me on Rockland\nI can be your freaky man, you can climb in, suck a 10\nWant some ends? You outta there\nNo more funny face, put you in your place\nCome be the dinner, I'ma bring a plate\n\n[Verse 3: Crucial Conflict]\nShe's my ghetto girl in her own world, she's a queen\nQueen of all things, for that I mean she's Spring\nPersonality rings bells in my dreams\nNight to dawn, light spread tight, let's swing\nGrip it in motion, wet coastin' with a little bit of ridin' rough\nUp and down we stroke, strokin' puttin' things in her pocket is fat\nBut watch her stay cool, calm and collected\nFlexin', check it, never was on that stressin'\n'Cause she bring that hay for the day, what a blessin'\nRight around the way from me\nThis ghetto queen got up with a king\nKeep it clean and in essence\n\n[Chorus: R.

What's my name?\nIt's Wyldstyle from Chitown, no shame\nMe and the ghetto queen comin' up the main\nSwitchin' four lanes, to the airplane\nSky high we fly when we roll by\nOn the down low, doin' my thang man\n\n[Chorus: R. Kelly]\nYou're my ghetto queen\nRight around the way from me\nWatering those ghetto trees\nWe be high just like them weeds\nYou're my ghetto queen\nRight around the way from me\nWatering those ghetto trees\nWe be high just like them weeds\n\n[Bridge: Crucial Conflict & R.
