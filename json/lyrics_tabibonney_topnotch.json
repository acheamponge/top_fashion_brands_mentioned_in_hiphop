On the throne, where we belong\nWelcome to the fashion show, you are now in my chateau\nBeautiful girls on overload, scan that like a bar code\nWhatever you want so non-chalant, guard that like avant\nShe all that, and then some. We kill for that where we from\nOther than that, it's all love, that's parbey even unplugged\nAnd you don't know what you do to me, definition of foolery\nStraight jacket and all that, your welcome packet is on the map\nI'm a member, if I remember --give it a sec. let it render\nHer waist line, still on my mind. I think about her all the time\nAnd I like, I likes, I like\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Tabi Bonney"}
