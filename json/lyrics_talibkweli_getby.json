Rap shit, Living to Let Die\n\n[Hook]\nThis morning, I woke up\nFeelin' brand new, I jumped up\nFeelin' my highs and my lows\nIn my soul and my goals\nJust to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'\nI've been thinkin' I've got my reasons\nJust to get by, just to get by\nJust to get by, just to get by\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe keepin' it gangster, say fo shizzle, fo sheezy, and stayin' crunk\nIt's easy to pull a breezy, smoke trees, and we stayin' drunk\nYo, I activism, attackin' the system, the Blacks and Latins in prison\nNumbers have risen, they're victims lackin' the vision\nShit, and all they got is rappin' to listen to\nI let them know we missin' you, the love is unconditional\nEven when the condition is critical, when the livin' is miserable\nYour position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin' you\nNow, why would I lie? Just to get by?\nJust to get by, we get fly, the TV got us reachin' for stars\nNot the ones between Venus and Mars, the ones that be readin' for parts\nSome people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers\nSaturday sinners, Sunday morning at the feet of the Father\nThey need somethin' to rely on, we get high on\nAll types of drug, when all you really need is love\nTo get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by\nOur parents sing like John Lennon: imagine all the people watch\nWe rock like Paul McCartney from now until the last Beatle drop\n\n[Hook]\nThis morning, I woke up\nFeelin' brand new, I jumped up\nFeelin' my highs and my lows\nIn my soul and my goals\nJust to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'\nAnd I've been thinkin' I've got my reasons\nJust to get by, just to get by\nJust to get by, just to get by\n\n[Outro]\nYoyoyo, yo, yo\nSome people cry, and some people try\nJust to get by, for a piece of the pie\nYou love to eat and get high\nWe deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly\nWhen the people decide to keep a disguise\nCan't see they eyes, see the evil inside\nBut there's people you find\nStrong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs\nSome people cry, and some people try\nJust to get by, for a piece of the pie\nYou love to eat and get high\nWe deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly\nWhen the people decide to keep a disguise\nCan't see they eyes, see the evil inside\nBut there's people you find\nStrong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
