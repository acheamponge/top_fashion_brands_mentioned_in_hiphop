Broke Again]\nCaught in them schemes (Yeah yeah)\nDubba-AA flex\nI don't believe, in what you believe (Yeah yeah, ugh)\nThat I gotta leave (Yeah, ugh, I gotta go)\nThis is the sound\n\n[Chorus: Youngboy Never Broke Again]\nGotta watch who around you\nBetter not get yourself caught in them schemes\nWe ain't the same I don't believe in what you believe\nI can't live forever, I know someday that I gotta leave\nCan't get caught in that fame, if I go broke I know they gon' leave\nGotta watch who around you\nBetter not get yourself caught in them schemes\nWe ain't the same I don't believe in what you believe\nI can't live forever, I know someday that I gotta leave\nCan't get caught in that fame, if I go broke I know they gon' leave\n\n[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]\nThought we was forever, no I wasn't ready for you to just leave\nThis shit ain't forever, I know someday it's all gon' leave\nI'm in love wit' the drank, back to back, I'm steady sippin' that lean\nThese niggas hate me but I'm up in the streets and I stay wit' that heat\nDon't mess wit' nobody but you running over me\nI swear to god I ain't havin' it\nSteady spendin' that money, we run it back up\nWe get it and flip it and stack the shit\nMy godmother white, I live the same, my lil' cousin AJ is african\nSo don't come at me wit' that racist shit\nCommentin' under my Insta pic\nRalph Lauren everything, I'm so fresh and clean\nAsics on my feet, around my waist a V\nFuck wit' DGK but rather rock Supreme\nTrue Religion beanie, True Religion jeans\n\n[Chorus: Youngboy Never Broke Again]\nGotta watch who around you\nBetter not get yourself caught in them schemes\nWe ain't the same I don't believe in what you believe\nI can't live forever, I know someday that I gotta leave\nCan't get caught in that fame, if I go broke I know they gon' leave\nGotta watch who around you\nBetter not get yourself caught in them schemes\nWe ain't the same I don't believe in what you believe\nI can't live forever, I know someday that I gotta leave\nCan't get caught in that fame, if I go broke I know they gon' leave\n\n[Verse 2: Dubba-AA]\nGrowing up in my city I had to hustle\nSee momma ain't have it, I had to get it off the muscle (Off the muscle)\nKill or be killed niggas killed or be real\nNiggas plot on your spot, tryna make it to the top\nSee I done heard plenty niggas waiting on my downfall\nChel passed me the rock, told me that it's time to ball\nFlexing and finessing, I'm flexing never stressing\nStay prayed up, that's why God keep on blessing (The killer)\nMe and my family, the lessons that he taught to me\nGet the money first, hoes second, that's the strategy\nDubba-AA you know I doubled up on my profit\nI'm never broke again shoutout to YoungBoy he my partner, aye\n\n[Chorus: Youngboy Never Broke Again]\nGotta watch who around you\nBetter not get yourself caught in them schemes\nWe ain't the same I don't believe in what you believe\nI can't live forever, I know someday that I gotta leave\nCan't get caught in that fame, if I go broke I know they gon' leave\nGotta watch who around you\nBetter not get yourself caught in them schemes\nWe ain't the same I don't believe in what you believe\nI can't live forever, I know someday that I gotta leave\nCan't get caught in that fame, if I go broke I know they gon' leave\n\n[Verse 3: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]\nI'm uppin' so you need to stay the fuck up out my business\nWhen I go through it, it ain't your problem so to you I would not mention\nStacking paper and I pray that I don't never stop gettin' it\nYou was in it but you flopped, I won't flop now that I'm in it\nRidin' round in a Rolls Royce, I'm always [?] baby\nCelebratin', Ace Of Spade got me feelin' brazy\nRollie watch up on my arm, look I'm proud I made it\nI just gave my mom the racks, I'm still thanking Jesus\nI'm just signed to Atlantic and I can't believe it\nWon't chase you, you can't see you're worth\nThen baby I don't need you\nNiggas just can't play they role, rippin' off they people\nNigga you can play that role and get hit with this heater\nSince I was young it's been my dream\nBut this shit ain't what it seem\nIt get grimy for that money, everybody tryna scheme\nWe hit bottom know we running, we gon' stick him out his green\nThey conniving and profiling, stay concealed by any means\n\n[Chorus: Youngboy Never Broke Again]\nGotta watch who around you\nBetter not get yourself caught in them schemes\nWe ain't the same I don't believe in what you believe\nI can't live forever, I know someday that I gotta leave\nCan't get caught in that fame, if I go broke I know they gon' leave\nGotta watch who around you\nBetter not get yourself caught in them schemes\nWe ain't the same I don't believe in what you believe\nI can't live forever, I know someday that I gotta leave\nCan't get caught in that fame, if I go broke I know they gon' leave"}], "artist": "YoungBoy Never Broke Again"}
