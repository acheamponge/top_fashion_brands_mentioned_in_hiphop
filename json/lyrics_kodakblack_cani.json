Can I chill?\nCan I stunt?\nWill I live long enough to raise my son?\nMade something out of nothin'\nAin't nothin' where I'm from\nCan your boy do something productive for once?\nAnd once a nigga make it, they gon' wanna take it\nMoney don't change ya, but it do drive ya crazy\nLil' nigga out the projects, they rootin' for the baby\nEven when you showin' love, they still gon' wanna hate ya\n\n[Verse 1]\nIf I tell you how I feel, can I fuck?\nI gotta see if the pussy good before I cuff\nI'm really in the field so I need someone to hug\nI'm out here like for real so I be needin' a little love\nAll you gotta do is grind\nIt's gon' take time\nAin't no time to chill\nAin't no time to vibe\nAll my people wanted me to sit my ass down\nBut I been on go since I got off my behind\nEverybody wanna shine\nNobody wanna grind\nSee my nigga workin' hard, that shit paid him off fine\nNone of this shit just fall from the sky\nI'm puttin' in work, I done forgot that I was tired\n\n[Chorus]\nCan I ball? Can I chill?\nCan I stunt?\nWill I live long enough to raise my son?\nMade something out of nothin'\nAin't nothin' where I'm from\nCan your boy do something productive for once?\nAnd once a nigga make it, they gon' wanna take it\nMoney don't change ya, but it do drive ya crazy\nLil' nigga out the projects, they rootin' for the baby\nEven when you showin' love, they still gon' wanna hate ya\n\n[Verse 2]\nCan a nigga eat in peace?\nYou leechin' for a crumb\nNiggas ain't even showin' ya love where ya from\nThem people took my 40s, so I'm about to go buy a pump\nWhat if the trolls roll up on me right? Should I run?\nCan I take you out to lunch?\nI just wanna get you full then get all in your stomach\nI just made shawty tell a man that she done\nLately she been tellin' me she love me, should I run?\nI'm gone, I'm done\nI shook and went describin'\nI'm not a bad kid, I just didn't have no guidance\nFuck a home run, you boys be runnin' in houses\nRobbin', connivin', wylin' and burglarizin'\n\n[Chorus]\nCan I ball? Can I chill?\nCan I stunt?\nWill I live long enough to raise my son?\nMade something out of nothin'\nAin't nothin' where I'm from\nCan your boy do something productive for once?\nAnd once a nigga make it, they gon' wanna take it\nMoney don't change ya, but it do drive ya crazy\nLil' nigga out the projects, they rootin' for the baby\nEven when you showin' love, they still gon' wanna hate ya"}]}
