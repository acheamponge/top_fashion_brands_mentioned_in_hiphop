Lot of plans have been put in motion. Now it's only a matter of time. I feel like that time is here. You know, I said it before and I can say it again, man: every street nigga's not a rapper. Every rapper's not a street nigga. But when you get them two things together, in the right of rightest of ways, it's like magic, baby. So 2 Chainz, pass me a cup. About half full. I'm good with that. And let me do what I do best, man. They don't call me Drama F. Kennedy for no motherfuckin' reason. See, I'm here on this Codeine Cowboy with the hottest in the city without a gangster grill"}], "artist": "2 Chainz"}
