{"songs": [{"lyrics": "I'm a hyphen hater\nIf you are in between my words  I'll see you later\nCause I'm a hyphen hater\nYou are silent when I speak but I can see you on paper\nYou are higher than an underscore\nBut no more\nTo me, you're as dead as Latin\nI can't even hear you, when I am chattin'\nZ comes after Y, we all know that\nSo why did you have to get involved? Like some big man that\nWas there something wrong with my grammar? Well now it doesn't matter\nMy name is four letters split by the button which is fatter\nYou are only good for pause, but when I got my flow\nNo one will stop me until I bring the applause\nMy alphabet goes from Jay to Z, you are not a proper letter\nSo that is why, I have decided that a space is much better\nThis should not be a surprise to you, your kind of character was up for being dismissed\nSo now that you are free go catch some vibes with brother asterisk\nForward slash, back slash, hash tag, comma, no thank you\nOnly the alphabet will do, I'm keepin' it simple with syllable two\nAfter zero is where you belong\nAt the end of all those numbers is where you are strong\nSharing with cousin underscore\nPlus and equals sitting next door\nAll is not lost, you have set a legacy\nOn websites, tickets, records and CD\nThis is not the end\nYou were more than a connector, you were my friend\nThere is a new journey on the horizon\nGo and enjoy life by saying 'Hi Fun!'", "title": "Hyphen Hater", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf0f68ee56f29c8542ad805c6419682b.676x676x1.jpg", "year": "2014-09-01", "album": null}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
