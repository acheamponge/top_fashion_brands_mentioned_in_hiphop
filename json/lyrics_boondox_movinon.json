And when my light faded\nI'm still alive and I'm still kickin but It also jaded\nFucked up relationships\nThe king is striking love to matches\nSoaked in gasoline and burned away on every mattress\nAnd yes I know that burns you up\nI know I did you wrong..\nThat's why the only thing to do is leave on living on\n\n[Hook: Demi Demaree]\nAnd If you see her\nTell her I've been gone\nAin't nothin left to talk about\nTell her I've moved on\nAnd tell her I've been thinkin\nThinking all night long\nAnd if she ever comes around\nTell her I've been gone\nAnd tell her I've moved on\n\n[Verse 2: Boondox]\nMy hands are dirty with some things that I can't wipe away\nJust like some words that are said and I forgot to say\nThey say that time can heal, but time is all that's left to kill\nI might end up alone but that's the hand they had to deal\nThe easy path, that never been the one for me to take\nI think sometimes I'm only happy with the shit I break\nI know I'm hard to love\nMy demons keep me in the black\nSometimes I wish that I could change, but ain't no turning back\nThat's why I roll with heed of revengeance. Serve the bittersweet\nA jealous rage that might be waitin' for me in the street\nTo put a end to all the pain I seem to leave behind\nThat might be why I make it easy, I ain't hard to find\nI wish that I could I'm say sorry for this trail of tears\nApologize for wasted time and all the wasted years\nBut that's the way I live my life\nI put it in a song\nYet we was just another verse and now I'm living on\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Jelly roll]\nWish I had the time a day, been grindin tryin to find a way\nBeen grindin tryin to start a movement\nModern day Violent J\nWhiskey makes me tipsy for a  minute I forget the pain\nAll of a sudden people know my name, I swear this shit's insane\nFrom penitentiary blues to sold out shows\nAin't seen my daughter in some months, man I've been out on the road\nMan I've been running from reality through all the songs I say\nAnd somehow I fucked off relationships along the way\nLet me pop another pill but I'm still feelin the same\nWouldn't know I was alive if I didn't feel any pain\nI was engaged to a woman\nShe got up and moved away\nSaid I was a lunatic that can't communicate\nSo I wish that I could find her so that we could have a talk\nAnd then burn the bitches house down and just wait for the cops\nRiddled they called the bullets the moment that I see em\nThen maybe they'll kill me and my life will be complete\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/181444660a65d0000670a98f7f5af756.400x400x1.jpg"}]}
