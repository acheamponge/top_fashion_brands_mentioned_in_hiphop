I'm the poetical pastor\nSlave to a label, but I own my masters\nStill get it poppin' without artist and repertoire\n'Cause Monch is a monarch, only minus the A&R\nWhen my brain excels, your train derails\nPop shit, make you feel the Clipse like Pharrell\nYou will feel me, you will admire\nMy struggle, my hustle, my soul, desire\n\n[Chorus: Showtyme]\nOoh, oh, yeah\nSaid, it's my desire, yes it is, yeah\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nSaid, it's my desire\n\n[Verse 2: Pharaohe Monch]\nMy book is a ovary, the pages I lust to turn\nMy pen's the penis, when I write, the ink's the sperm\nDesire, the fire that ignites the torch to burn\nThis is not rocket science, this is easy to learn\nMy mic's the gavel, when I talk, court's adjourned\nRespect, even if you were ashes, you couldn't earn\nI embody antibiotics, you are infected with germs\nRap's fatally ill, please get concerned\nPlayers pick turns to play, get burned\nI color commentate the game like Chick Hearn\nThis is the moment of truth for my opponents and liars\nVocals alone invoke the emotion of black choirs\nFire, you don't wanna get burned like Rich Pryor\nMove back, who's that there? The live wire\nYou will feel me, you will admire\nMy struggle, my hustle, my soul, desire\n\n[Chorus: Showtyme]\nOoh, oh, yeah\nSaid, it's my desire, yes it is, yeah\nIt's my desire, keep pushin', keep strivin'\nMy passion, my fire, that's my desire\nI keep pushin', I keep strivin'\nThat's my desire, I keep pushin', I keep strivin'\nThat's my desire, I keep pushin', I keep strivin'", "year": "2007-06-26"}]}
