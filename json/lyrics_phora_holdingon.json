I fuckin' needed you\n\n[Pre-Chorus: keshi]\nMovin' on, never feel the same\nNothin' seems to cover up the pain\nBaby, I've been tryin' but you can't hear what I say\nBaby, baby-y-y\n\n[Chorus: Phora & keshi]\nBaby I\u2019ve been tryin', nothin' seems to cover up the pain\nI\u2019ve been tryin', holdin' on, holdin' on\nBaby I\u2019ve been tryin', nothin' seems to cover up the pain\nI\u2019ve been trying, holdin' on, holdin' on\n\n[Outro: keshi]\nBaby, baby, baby, baby\nNothin' seems to cover up the pain\nBaby, baby, baby, baby\nNothin' seems to cover up the pain", "year": "2018-03-30"}]}
