Let's go\n\n[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]\nA wise man know what he know, and what he doesn't\nIf he's not really sure what he's saying, he don't discuss it\nA righteous man walks the earth without judgment\nAnd loves his enemies enough to deliver justice\nA pious man relies on religion for his direction\nAt times he introspective, but his biblehood never questioned\nA dying man will make a confession, try to get into heaven\nThinking his lifestyle is blocking his blessing\nA violent man will stock up on weapons and go to war for his\nGet post-traumatic stress disorder, become an officer\nA man of peace uses his words in different mediums\nHe'll bleed for his beliefs practicing civil disobedience\nAn honest man knows only liars are scared of the truth\nHis word is his bond but his action's always the proof\nA faithful man never need evidence to believe\nBut still he gotta work for the blessings that he receives\nLet's go\n\n[Chorus: Yummy Bingham]\nSometimes it's hard to believe\nIn what you don't see or understand\nBut the picture is so much bigger\nThan what we could even imagine\nIt's hard to feel better\nWhen the weight of the world make you feel sadder\nPut your faith into action\nHeads up and eyes open\n\n[Verse 2: Rick Ross]\nTop tier niggas blossomed in the basement\nAll the nights that we were lacking those refreshments\nRain down, thunderstorm with the flows\nArticulate with the bounce now I'm back like I'm Derrick Rose\nOnce the one on the bench with the snotty nose\nNefertiti would hold me when I was cold\nCommunion Sunday, my twenties went in the bowl\nForgive me Lord for them bitches the night before\nBusiness deals and the Bentleys I can't afford\nGotta be the example for children to do their chores\nBlowing weed smoke on the cover of The Source\nRolling Stones, on the gone, it was the boss\nFallen soldier on his own so we march\nRoll up a bag of that weed, therefore I spark\nRecite the Quran, I'm in the dark\nDevil knocking on my door, he like a narc\n\n[Chorus: Yummy Bingham]\nSometimes it's hard to believe\nIn what you don't see or understand\nBut the picture is so much bigger\nThan what we could even imagine\nIt's hard to feel better\nWhen the weight of the world make you feel sadder\nPut your faith into action\nHeads up and eyes open\n\n[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]\nNo excuses, if I start it then I'll see it through\nGod is what I see in you so you might as well believe in you\nThink what you see on TV's true? The media deceiving you\nThey misrepresenting, misquoting then they misleading you\nBelief is a funny thing, in case you're wondering\nIf they want the ring, they coming for the throne like they the sons of kings\nThese average rappers is acting up for the dough\nYeah I tell you what I believe but I back it up with what I know (oh!)\nIt's the facts versus the facts simile, your raps killing me\nMy last victory was great moments in Black history\nI celebrated with a bottle I just brought back from Italy\nAnd some loud, I got super packs like I backed Hillary\nLost in desire, I walked through the Devil's fire\nI inspire the resurrection of kings like Hezekiah\nThe trust you put in me to be a, beast with this rhyming\nThat's where the rubber meets the road and where your faith meets science\nLet's go\n\n[Chorus: Yummy Bingham]\nSometimes it's hard to believe\nIn what you don't see or understand\nBut the picture is so much bigger\nThan what we could even imagine\nIt's hard to feel better\nWhen the weight of the world make you feel sadder\nPut your faith into action\nHeads up and eyes open\n\n[Outro: Talib Kweli & Yummy Bingham]\nTake it to the top, take it to the top\nYeah, yeah, take it to the top, take it to the top\nTake it to the top, take it to the top"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
