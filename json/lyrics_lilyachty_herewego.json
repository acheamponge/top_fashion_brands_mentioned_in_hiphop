Do ya?\nI bet so cause when I'm at home alone\nAnd you come across my dome, I hear voices of your moan\nAnd when I look at my dresser every time I see your thong\nAnd it make me think about when I get you alone\n\n[Hook]\nOhh ohh, Baby here we go\nEvery time we doing great this nigga always mess up the picture\nTell me what\u2019s the issue\nI need me some Swishers, to take my mind away\nI need to escape\nOhh ohh, baby here we go\nEvery time we doing great this nigga always mess up the picture\nTell me what\u2019s the issue\nI need me some Swishers, to take my mind away\nI need to escape\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I\u2019m getting tired\nTired of trying\nTrying to drag us, but that shit goes nowhere\nI miss when you loved me\nBut I know that means nothing\nWhen I move on I hope that you feel the punishment\nThe punishment of being stuck with that lame nigga\nWho can\u2019t do shit for ya\nYou know that I\u2019ll be there for ya\nBut you gotta let me know what\u2019s up\n\n[Hook]\nOhh ohh, Baby here we go\nEvery time we doing great this nigga always has to mess up the picture\nTell me what\u2019s the issue\nI need me some Swishers, to take my mind away\nI need to escape\nAnd I\u2019m getting tired\nTired of trying\nTrying to drag us, but that shit just goes nowhere\nI miss when you loved me\nBut I know that means nothing\nWhen I move on I hope that you feel the punishment\nThe punishment of being stuck with that lame nigga\nWho can\u2019t do shit for ya\n\n[Outro]\nIt's RD\nMy brother Earl on the beat\nI need me a bitch who gon' be a nasty freak but only for me\nOhh ohh, ohh ohh ohh\nBaby here we go\nOhh ohh, ohh ohh ohh"}], "artist": "Lil Yachty"}
