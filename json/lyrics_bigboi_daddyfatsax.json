C'mon!\n\n[Hook: scratches by DJ Cutmaster Swiff]\n\"Look at the way you look at me\" \u2013 \"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\"\n\"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps\"\n\"Look at the way you look at me\" \u2013 \"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\"\n\"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps\"\n\"Look at the way you look at me\" \u2013 \"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\"\n\"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps\"\n\"Look at the way you look at me\" \u2013 \"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\"\n\"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy daddy told me it was mine for the takin'\nA true gift from God, the stars aligned when they made me\nHim and Rena's baby, their first born son\nI'm Antwan Andr\u00e9 Patton, the only one\nBloodline of a champion with heart of the lion\nI'm defyin' all the laws like a caterpillar flying\nWay before my time and reside in the Dirty Dirty\nWhere they still hangin' nooses like we in the early '30s\nGoddamn, you know who I am?
