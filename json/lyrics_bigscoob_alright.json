Lord knows where he\u2019s at\nHow the story goes, mama could never be exact\nToo many sexcapades, always layed on her back\nEven Marley said he saw it, quit coming back\nLil mama, she's a victom of the same life\nLiving trifling with a different nigga every night\nSeaking love, but don\u2019t really know what love is\nNever had it, never felt it, she's a lil kid\nOld enough to take it rough, plus she hella thick\nLil niggas on loan, she's the hood's bitch\nNow she\u2019s starting to grow, and really starting to show\nSo every nigga she be hitting they got ghosts\nOnce again all alone, it's the same song\nComing to them days, she got a child to raise, and she's on her own\n\n[Chorus :?]\nAlright, it's gonna be alright\nAlright, it's gonna be alright\nAlright, it's gonna be alright\nAlright, it's gonna be alright\n\n[Verse 3: Irv Da Phenom]\nMama told me there'd be days like this\nBut I would never think that they'd hate like this\nThey see the young nigga winning, and they all straight pissed\nBut they won't bring it to my face, they switch it up like this\nI mean really though, they hated on Jesus Christ\nSo how you think there ain't gon be no suckers in your life?\nI'm just rolling with the punches, gotta learn to stick and move\nKeep it silant, keep it true\nWhile I do what I do\nNever let them see me sweating, never folding under pressure\nSo when the times get hard, it's never me they get the best of\nCause I know something they don't know\nOnly mission is to pray, hop back on your toe\nSometimes, it might feel like the world's on your shoulders\nBut just keep pushing, it'll make you stronger\nThat's what you gotta do, I'm young and got a lot to prove\nCause I won't stop till I'm on top, and above you\nI'll get it, as long as god is by my side\nTrippin off of nothing, I know it's gon be alright\n\n[Chorus :?]\nAlright, it's gonna be alright\nAlright, it's gonna be alright\nAlright, it's gonna be alright\nAlright, it's gonna be alright"}], "artist": "Big Scoob"}
