I got 4 or 5 of those\nBest of the best\nI'm clever with words\n[?]\nThey couldn't bet on my worst[?]\nYou're all jokers with punter rhymes\nYour punches are [?]\nI don't sound like Slim\n[?]\nI got signed by Mike but I don't sound like Him\n\n[Hook]\nI got the trunk shit\nPlay my CD and bump it\nI'm PG and I run shit\nHow dare you run lips\nAnd what how quick I run this\nI'm not to be fucked with\n\n[Verse 2]\nI could be [?]\nCharged off a knee[?]\nI could still bury these rappers in half of a key[?]\nThats two bars[?]\nBuddy your new sound weak[?]\nI will succeed like a budgie with no teeth\nMy old bars make your new sound sound dated\nIn fact my old bars make you new sound ancient\nSo run and hide before you get mummified and wrapped up quick\nYour man suck dick\nYou lick balls for a living\nI lick 8 balls for a living\n[?]\n[?]\nI'm cool because I live it\n[?]\nMy cockney swagger could not be badder\nFor east and polite[?]\nYou could not be madder\nFrom now til the day they lock me in the slammer\nYou know I bangers up[?]\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don't think I don't need nothing\nDogs are your companions\nCats only come back when they need something\nI'm a shopper I know what cash is\nKeep notes in 10 folds elastic bandages[?]\nBalls in my reefa[?]\nWalking through the streets of East looking like I need to pull my jeans up\nI'll be sagging my jeans in my 30's\nI'm dirty I'll be bagging green till they hurl me [?]\nBreath ingest [?]\nTrying to breath for stress\n[?]\nI'll sleep when I'm dead\nDragging on a big spliff, I ain't high\nA real man talk softly but be carries a big stick\nFuck life I'm getting a .9 to get you[?]\n[?]\nI'm going to where I'm trying to get to\nHigh speed so you best move\n\n[Hook]", "year": null}]}
