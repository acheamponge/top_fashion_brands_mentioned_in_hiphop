{"songs": [{"title": "Bust a Move (Don Rimini Ravekid extended remix)", "lyrics": "This here's a jam for all the fellas\nTry to do what those ladies tell us\nGet shot down 'cause you're overzealous\nPlay hard to get, females get jealous\nOK smarty, go to a party\nGirls are scantily clad and showin' body\nA chick walks by you wish you could sex her\nBut you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter\n\nNext day's function, high class luncheon\nFood is served and you're stone cold munchin'\nMusic comes on, people start to dance\nBut then you ate so much you nearly split your pants\nA girl starts walkin', guys start gawkin'\nSits down next to you and starts talkin'\nSays she wanna dance 'cause she likes the groove\nSo come on, fatso, and just bust a move\n\n(vocal scatting)\nJust bust a move!\n\nYou're on a mission and you're wishin'\nSomeone could cure your lonely condition\nLookin' for love in all the wrong places\nNo fine girls, just ugly faces\nFrom frustration, first inclination\nIs to become a monk and leave the situation\nBut every dark tunnel has a lighter hope\nSo don't hang yourself with a celibate rope\n\nNew movie's showin', so you're goin'\nCould care less about the five you're blowin'\nTheatre gets dark just to start the show\nThen you spot a fine woman sittin' in your row\nShe's dressed in yellow, she says \"Hello\nCome sit next to me, you fine fellow!\"\nYou run over there without a second to lose\nAnd what comes next? Hey, bust a move!\n\nIf you want it, you got it\nIf you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move!)\nIf you want it, you got it\nIf you want it, baby, you got it\n\nIn the city, ladies look pretty\nGuys tell jokes so they can seem witty\nTell a funny joke just to get some play\nThen you try to make a move and she says, \"No way.\"\nGirls are fakin', goodness sakin'\nThey want a man who brings home the bacon\nGot no money and you got no car\nThen you got no woman and there you are\n\nSome girls are sadistic, materialistic\nLooking for a man makes them opportunistic\nThey're lyin' on the beach perpetratin' a tan\nSo that a brother with money can be their man\nSo on the beach you're strollin', real high-rollin'\nEverything you have is yours and not stolen\nA girl runs up with somethin' to prove\nSo don't just stand there, bust a move!\n\nIf you want it, you got it\nIf you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move)\nIf you want it, you got it\nIf you want it, baby, you got it. (Break it down for me fellas)\n\n(vocal scatting)\n\nYour best friend Harry has a brother Larry\nIn five days from now he's gonna marry\nHe's hopin' you can make it there if you can\n'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man\nYou say neato, check your libido\nAnd roll to the church in your new tuxedo\nThe bride walks down just to start the wedding\nAnd there's one more girl you won't be getting\n\nSo you start thinkin', then you start blinkin'\nA bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin'\nShe thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back\nAnd now you're feelin' really firm 'cause the girl is stacked\nReception's jumpin', bass is pumpin'\nLook at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'\nSays she wants to dance to a different groove\nNow you know what to do, G, bust a move!\n\nIf you want it, you got it\nIf you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move)\nIf you want it, you got it\nIf you want it, baby, you got it. (Move it, boy)\n\n(vocal scatting)", "album": null, "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/038529dc16c13b795320436dc4e3d212.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young MC"}
