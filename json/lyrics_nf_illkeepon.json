You said you've always got your hands out\nAnd I cannot continue on my own, so take my hands now\nI give you everything, God, not just a little bit\nTake it from me, I am nothing but a hypocrite\nI hate sin, but I built a house and I still live in it\nAfraid to open up the door to You and let You into it\nMy soul is lost and what it needs is Your direction\nI know, I've told You I do not need Your protection\nBut I lied to You, this thing is tiring\nAnd man was not created for it, God\nPlease retire me now\n\n[Hook: Jeremiah Carlson]\nOh these hands are tired\nOh this heart is tired\nOh this soul is tired\nBut I'll keep on\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on\n\n[Verse 2: NF]\nTrust is something I am not accustomed to\nAnd I know the Bible says I should always trust in You\nBut, I don't never read that book enough\nAnd when I have a question I don't take the time to look it up\nOr pick it up\nIt collects dust on my nightstand\nI'm just being honest\nPlease take this outta my hands\nI have no control - I am just a person\nBut thank the Lord that I serve a God that's perfect\nI do not deserve the opportunity You've given me\nI never knew what freedom was until I learned what prison means\nI am not ashamed, I don't care if they remember me\nMy life will always have a hole, if You are not the centerpiece\nTake me out of bondage, take all of my pride\nIf I don't have a Savior, I don't have nothing inside\nTake all of my lust, take all of my lies\nThere's no better feeling than when I look in the sky, in Your eyes\nIt's amazing\n\n[Hook: Jeremiah Carlson]\nOh these hands are tired\nOh this heart is tired\nOh this soul is tired\nBut I'll keep on\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on\n\n[Outro]\nWoaahh\nWoah woah woah\nWoaahh\nWoah woah woah\nWoaah\nWoah woah woah\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on\n\nWoaahh\nWoah woah woah\nWoaahh\nWoah woah woah\nWoaah\nWoah woah woah\n\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on\n\nWoaahh\nWoah woah woah\nWoaahh\nWoah woah woah\nWoaah\nWoah woah woah\n\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on\nI'll keep on"}], "artist": "NF"}
