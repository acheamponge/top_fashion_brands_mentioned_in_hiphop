Can you blame him?\nWith his light straining face with the ultimate ultimatum\nYou either starve\nPlay the sideline and get involved\nThey urge you to get a job\nYou gave resumes, not a call\nAnything for his kid\nNever cared to be rich\nThe thought of consequences gets dismissed when eatin' chips\nBought that life for a murder, his momma left, he was six\nGuess he a son of a gun and a son of a bitch\nHomie said the smackin' gavel's like the smokin' barrel\nBut you can hardly blame a world that ain't hardly travel\nJust know we brothers, only God can judge us\nAnd with this music I'ma make the haters love us, that's real\n\n[Chorus]\nJust 'cause I'm gone doesn't mean that I don't love you, oh\nAnd through this window I just wish that I could touch you, oh\nAnd even though I'm goin' away\nI'll be home one day\nI'll be home one day\nKnow that I'll be home one day\n\n[Verse 2]\nPicture this\nAss, tits and hips\nNothin' less than thick\nMac all on her lips\nTop down on the whip\nBarely 25, in a newest ride and her momma ain't buy that shit\nShe tried high school and she quit\nHit the strip then learn to script\nMet the dawg, that was it\nFell in love, had a kid\nAverage black ghetto male\nEven broke I'm doin' bids\nLast I heard servin' 25 to life\nShootin' over dice\nHead crack, hunnid dollar game, said he shot him twice\nTissues for the woman with the bad ammunitions\nWhat don't kill you gon' build you\nJust buy the pistol, I feel you\nThem perverts testing your patience\nIf you had options you quit\nBut gotta see that you think\nJust watchin' tricks from this tricks\nShe put the pussy for rental\nAnd a price on the dental\nBut if she knew her potential\nThat girl could be monumental\nBut can you blame her?\nDamn, can you blame her?\nAll for her daughter she sells prized possessions to a stranger\nUntil the night he raped her\nFallowed her home\nPistol in her purse\nHoldin' her own\nStill haunted by the scent of his cologne\nOne in his dome, she call 911 and hang up the phone, shit\nWill they believe me or you? You or me?\nAnd cop a plea\nServin' 25 to life for 23\nAnd for somethin' she ain't tryna be\nThey found the fingerprints and they believe a story\nGone for homicidal robbery, damn\n\n[Chorus]\nJust 'cause I'm gone doesn't mean that I don't love you, oh\nAnd through this window I just wish that I could touch you, oh\nAnd even though I'm goin' away\nI'll be home one day\nI'll be home one day\nKnow that I'll be home one day\n\n[Bridge: Female vocals]\nAway\nI'll be home one day\nI'll be home, home one day\nI'll be home\nI'll be home one day\nI'll be home\nI'll be home one day\n\n[Chorus]\nJust 'cause I'm gone doesn't mean that I don't love you, oh\nAnd through this window I just wish that I could touch you, oh\nAnd even though I'm goin' away\nI'll be home one day\nI'll be home one day\nKnow that I'll be home one day\n\n[Interlude 1]\nYo, ya already know man it's big ol' G, greezy motherfuckin' money, bitch\nShout all my niggas, real niggas fuckin' shit man\nShout out man, that nigga should be posted in here, in that motherfuckin' cell block and shit\nThese niggas ain't hear that shit, go get that motherfuckin' body man\nThese niggas greezy motherfuckin' money, you dun know man\n[?] do this motherfuckin' [?] right now\nGive that nigga that motherfuckin' bail\nFuck a bail, fuck a bail\nMan, another hundred motherfuckin' years on paper\nA nigga ain't cryin' over that motherfuckin' job\nHe won't do, man\nWe the motherfucker up here, man\nWe the motherfucker up here, man\nMy niggas already told me, man\nThe black coffee will be well [?]\n\nKnow that I'll be home one day\n\n[Interlude 2]\nYo what's goin' on this is Bob, a.k.a.
