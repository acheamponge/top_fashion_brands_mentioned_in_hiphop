You know I'm the man ho\nNothing but a bird, I'mma leave you where you stand, ho\nHeard you got a man ho, hope he understand though\nYou ain't nothing but a creeper baby, I'm just saying though\nSaying though, aye, it ain't nothing to cut that bitch off\nIt ain't nothing to cut that bitch off\n\n[Verse 1]\nCreeping on the low, hope your man don't see\nShe will bust it down for some damn Lime-A-Ritas\nChew me like some bubblegum, something like Rasheeda\nGotta get my partner some, she on me like Adidas\nBaby, you can't hold back, better stop flexing like you not\nYour man tryna patrol then I guess he is a cop\nBut he really can't cuff if he busting at my spot\nBut I done had enough cause you making my shit hot\nBlowing up a nigga phone, what I tell yo ass 'bout that?\nTryna hold something, hold my nuts, can you do that?\nCan you play around with that mouth while he hit it from the back?\nYou can't say nothing now cause we all been through that, through that\n\n[Hook]\nIt ain't nothing to cut that bitch off\nIt ain't nothing to cut that bitch off\nSo what you saying ho? You know I'm the man ho\nSo what you saying ho? You know I'm the man ho\n\n[Verse 2]\nBaby I'm ashamed, why you acting this way?\nHeard she 'bout that action, you can bring her this way\nHit her on yo mattress, make you feel some type of way\nPass her to my migos, they gonna bust it, \u00a1Andale!\nPlease don't play no games cause I know thats what you like\nKnock it out the frame, baby girl, it's alright\nYeah that pussy bomb, I just call it dynamite\nYou ready? Here I come, I can do this shit all night\n\n[Hook]\nIt ain't nothing to cut that bitch off\nIt ain't nothing to cut that bitch off\nSo what you saying ho? You know I'm the man ho\nNothing but a bird, I'mma leave you where you stand, ho\nHeard you got a man ho, hope he understand though\nYou ain't nothing but a creeper baby, I'm just saying though\nSaying though, aye, it ain't nothing to cut that bitch off\nIt ain't nothing to cut that bitch off"}], "artist": "K CAMP"}
