Yep for real\nAs we rolling out the hills on course for the city\nGoodbye to Heineys Bonjour to the Whitneys\nHeres a number you can hit me on\nRoll a joint bro forget the bong and pour some liquor that'll get me gone\nSo now im hazed and I'm boozed\nFeeling like Mitch from Dazed and Confused\nLookin' at the older dudes\nLike they Matthew McConaughey\nWe just some gonners aye\nAnd Aquemini Track 8 is all I wanna play cause\n\n[Chours]\nI'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased\nI got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East\nSo flyin, or floatin, a Brougham is what I'm sportin\nSade is in my tape deck, I'm movin in slow motion boi\n\nI'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased\nI got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East\nSo flyin, or floatin, a Brougham is what I'm sportin\nSade is in my tape deck, I'm movin in slow motion boi\n\n[Verse 2 PNC]\nStayin Blas\u00e9 on a Friday Faded\nPlayin Sade or Sade's Greatest\nSmooth operaters yeah we're top rated\nLaying in the weather where you hear the cicadas\nClub overpaid us and I'm bout to drop it all on a new pair that came out\nThe Decade I was born so\nCheck the status no check the status though\nEither way you say this I'mma still remain the baddest yo\nBefore I had the flow, I was slick daddy'o\nBack when I was drawing pictures on my grans patio\nChasing women with the fanny ??and the nudy teens??", "year": null}]}
