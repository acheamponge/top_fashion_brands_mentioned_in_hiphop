Is it clearer?\nWho you see when you look in the mirror?\nAll the dreams and fantasies that come together\nI'll be shining like a diamond that\u2019s forever\n\n[Hook]\nNow congratulate me (x8)\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow this the moment I\u2019ve been waiting for my whole life\nDidn\u2019t believe it \u2019til I seen with my own eyes\nImma need a black tux and a bow tie\nDouble cup, white chucks and a strobe light\nNiggas have bad luck when they roll dice\nThe numbers add up and they don\u2019t lie\nShowtime, my bread butter on both sides\nTook it to the champagne from the Morvite, now everybody come on\nAw\u2019bula boot (aw\u2019 bula boot)\nJC le Roux (aw\u2019bona)\nThat\u2019s all I think about, sitting up in my room (sitting up in my room)\nAw\u2019kuze kuse (aw\u2019kuze kuse)\nAw gin and juice (Aw\u2019 gin and juice)\nIt\u2019s all coming back to me like D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThink back to my old days\nAll I wanted was a gold chain\nSo stuck in my old ways\nNow we all household names\nWhat you know about sacrifice, flashing lights, rights of passage for bragging rights\nBad romances, packs of pampers\nAnd this ain\u2019t time to be camera shy\nMy one homie got a gun in the cupboard\nMy other homie got a bun in the oven\nBaby mama getting big in the stomach\nPop champagne or the Four Cousins\nI think it\u2019s time to be a man now\nI feel like moving to my gran\u2019s house\nEverybody lined up for a handout\nReally I just wanna make my old man proud\n\n[Bridge]\n[Hook]", "year": "2014-02-28", "album": "Levels", "image": "https://images.genius.com/963ed72af6b68081dc449da63b1d2c81.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "AKA"}
