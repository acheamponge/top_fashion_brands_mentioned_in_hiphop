S.O.L.A.R\nAnd people think I'm mad (Or on one)\nThen won't you tell them I'm mad, solar\nAll the things that bother me\nAin't no other way I can be\nOh, and people think I'm mad (Or on one)\nThen won't you tell them I'm mad, solar\nM.A.D. S.O.L.A.R\n\n[Verse 2]\nI guess I'm loony, I guess I'm on one\nGuess I got to finish my movie\nSee my heart has been swollen, it's healing slow\nHope I don't live to grow old, no one at home\nStaring at myself in the mirror, take one to know one\nWant to find out 'bout the real me?\nCertain moments reveal you\nEspecially friends who were never good friends\nBut want to act like they know me\nYou better keep going and keep on strolling\nIt's so crazy how you think you can play me\nShow them pussies you're growing\nHard times, they mold you\nTo the haters, I told you\nLet the world see how you win\nNo matter how you seem to them\nFuck 'em\nFuck 'em\nFuck 'em\nFuck 'em\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd people think I'm mad (Or on one)\nThen won't you tell them I'm mad, solar\nAll the things that bother me\nAin't no other way I can be\nAnd people think I'm mad (Or on one)\nThen won't you tell them I'm mad, solar\nM.A.D. S.O.L.A.R\nAnd people think I'm mad (Or on one)\nThen won't you tell them I'm mad, solar\nAll the things that bother me\nAin't no other way I can be\nAnd people think I'm mad (Or on one)\nThen won't you tell them I'm mad, solar\nM.A.D.
