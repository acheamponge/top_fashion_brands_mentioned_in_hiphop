(Ayy, ayy)\n\n[Chorus]\nGoin' through the motions, I'm just tryna make it through\nHard to keep in touch when I'm always on the move\nYou tell me that you love me, I don't know what I would do\nIf you wasn't by my side, will I be able to move?\nGoin' through the motions, I'm just tryna make it through\nIt's hard to keep in touch when I'm always on the move\nYou tell me that you love me, I don't know what I would do\nIf you wasn't by my side, would I be able to move?\n\n[Outro]\nBut it's okay..."}], "artist": "Lil Skies"}
