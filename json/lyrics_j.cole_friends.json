Cole]\nCop another bag and smoke today\nCop another bag and smoke today\nCop another bag and smoke today\nCop another bag and smoke today\nCop another bag and smoke today\nCop another bag and smoke today\nCop another bag and smoke today\nCop another bag and smoke today\n\n[Chorus: kiLL edward]\nI got thoughts, can't control\nGot me down, got me low\nRest my mind, rest my soul\nWhen I blow, when I blow\nAm I wrong, let them know\nFeels so right to let things go\nDon't think twice, this is me\nThis is how I should be\n\n[Bridge: J. Cole]\nBut I'm aggravated without it\nMy saddest days are without it\nMy Saturdays are the loudest\nI'm blowing strong\nSome niggas graduated to powder\nI dabble later, I doubt it\nMy database of narcotics\nIt's growing long\nBut I'm aggravated without it\nMy saddest days are without it\nMy Saturdays are the loudest\nI'm blowing strong\nSome niggas graduated to powder\nI dabble later, I doubt it\nMy database of narcotics\nIt's growing long\n\n[Verse: J. Cole]\nI wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction\nTo my niggas --- I hope you listening\n--- and ---, I hope you listening\nThis is for the whole fucking Ville, I hope you're listening\nSmoking medical grade, but I ain't got prescription\nAll the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-\n-tation, feeling like the only one that made it\nAnd I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition\nFuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition\nBlame it on crack, you can blame it on the system\nBlame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction\nTo ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in\nBlame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing\nBlame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton\nBlame it on trap music and the politicians\nOr the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen\nBut they only got 12 slots on the Pistons\nBlame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip\nWhat I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas\nJust to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's\nThere's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see\nType of shit that normally would call for therapy\nBut you know just how it go in our community\nKeep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be\nFast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees\nAnd popping pills due to chronic anxiety\nI been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus\nThis ain't no trial if you desire go higher please\nBut fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend\nWithout the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin\nI know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in\nYou running from yourself and you buying product again\nI know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend\nBut I know depression and drug addiction don't blend\nReality distorts and then you get lost in the wind\nAnd I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end\nOne thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day\nI'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away\nI understand this message is not the coolest to say\nBut if you down to try it I know of a better way\nMeditate\n\n[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]\nMeditate, meditate, meditate, meditate\nDon't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate\nMeditate, meditate, meditate, meditate\nDon't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate\n\n[Chorus: kiLL edward]\nI got thoughts, can't control\nGot me down, got me low\nRest my mind, rest my soul\nWhen I blow, when I blow\nAm I wrong, let them know\nFeels so right to let things go\nDon't think twice, this is me\nThis is how I should be\n\n[Outro: J. Cole]\nCop another bag of smoke today\nCop another bag of smoke today\nCop another bag of smoke today\nCop another bag of smoke today\nCop another bag of smoke today\nCop another bag of smoke today\nCop another bag of smoke today\nCop another bag of smoke today"}], "artist": "J.
