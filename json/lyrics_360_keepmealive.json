This is the scene of the crime\nWe need to be bleeding it dry\nWhere evil is winning and people\nAre dying and pleading to keep me alive\n\n[Hook: Bright Young Things]\nLove got us through the storm\nWhere we fell across for that high price built inside\nKeep\u2014keep me alive\nKeep\u2014keep me alive\nLove got us through the storm\nWhere we fell across for that high price built inside\nKeep\u2014keep me alive\nKeep\u2014keep me alive\n\n[Bridge: 360]\nYo, I'm thinking it's time we left\n'Cause not much time is left\nAnd I don't want to die just yet\n'Cause I know a lot of life is left\nAnd I'm needing to find my breath\nRight now, we're reaching the final steps\nSoon enough, you're going to find me dead\nWith no one taking the time of death\n\n[Hook: Bright Young Things]\nLove got us through the storm\nWhere we fell across for that high price built inside\nKeep\u2014keep me alive\nKeep\u2014keep me alive\nLove got us through the storm\nWhere we fell across for that high price built inside\nKeep\u2014keep me alive\nKeep\u2014keep me alive"}]}
