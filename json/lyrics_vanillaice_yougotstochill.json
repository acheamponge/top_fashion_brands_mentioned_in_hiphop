Cause she's a skeezoid\nWhen I'm on the scene I always rock the spot\nI grab the steel with the crown on top\nIn the beginnin -- I like to let my rhymes flow\nAnd at twelve I press cruise control\nSit back and relax, let my rhymes tax\nMaintain MC's while the Double E macks\nAlways calm under pressure, no need to act ill\nListen when I tell you boy, you gots to chill\n\nI be the personal computer information on rap\nLike the B-I-Z Markie says, I'll make your toes tap\nI format the rhymes, step by step\nMake em sound def to maintain my rep\nPrepared to come off, in case of a diss\nNot worried about a thing, cause we can do this\nI can turn the party out just by standin still\nMake the ladies scream and shout while the brothers act ill\nTake total control, of your body and soul\nPack a nine in my pants for when it's time to roll\n\nI'm the P, double-E, M-D-E-E\nAnd one thing I hate, is a bitin MC\nWhen I enter the party suckers always form a line\nThen they ease their way up, and try to bite my lines\nI did thousands of shows, dissed many faces\nAnd deal with new jacks, on a one-to-one basis\nBut every now and then a sucker MC gets courageous\nAnd like an epidemic it becomes contagious\nBut never the least they all R.I.P\nFor all those unaware it means Rest In Peace\nCause M.D. -- stands for Microphone Doctor\nAnd the capital P (capital P) capital M (capital M)\nCapital D-E-E's no doubt the chief rocker\nDon't like to get ill, but if I have to I kill\nSo believe me boy, you gots to chill\n\nCatch every word I'm sayin, no there's no delayin\nDon't hestitate to motivate the crowd I'm not playin\nSeeing is believin, you catch my drift?\nDon't try to a-dapt because I'm just too swift\n(How swift?) I'm so swift and that's an actual fact\nI'm like Zorro, I mark a E on your back\nI don't swing on no ropes or no iron cords\nThe only weapon is my rappin sword\n\nIntimidate MC's with the tone of my vocal drone\nWhen I'm pushin on the microphone\nCause I'm the funky rhyme maker, MC undertaker\nThe one who likes to max and relax..\nAnd when it's time, issue diggum-smack\nI keep their hands clappin, fingers snappin, feet tappin\nWhen it's time to roll Uzi patrol was packin\nThe PMD, the mic's my only friend\nAnd through the course of the party, I kill again and again\nSo if you're thinkin bout battlin you better come prepared\nCome witcha shield and your armor geared\nYou gots to chill", "album": "Vanilla Ice Is Back!
