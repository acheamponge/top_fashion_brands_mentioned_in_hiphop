Shit whats wrong with you?\n'Cause me I'm feeling good\nMe, I'm in my zone I look up in the sky, and I know this can't be home\nAnd I know I ain't alone\nThey try to take your home\nThey try to sway the weak, and they try to break the strong, huh\nBut I'm not a quitter\nGod's child not God's dinner\nOn God I'm Godzilla\nTry to plot, I'll make the plot thicker, huh\nSee the middle class got a lot slimmer, and the upper class got a lot richer\nThey want a revolt, they want you to riot, they want you to try it\nThey wanna provoke us to keep us divided, but the people are no longer quite\nThey say Bob they gon' to take you out if you keep rhyming this way!\nHuh, I say fuck it we all going to die anyways", "title": "ESCAPE", "album": "A.I.R.
