I got a bitch\nShe get round, she stay round\nGirl just wanna have fun, your bitch found a playground\nI swing by, slide through, see-saw'd her before\nNiggas won't believe this, record the freak broad\nOn the road to riches, these broads get detoured\nThey just firecrackers, we more like C4's\nThink we talking blowing up, pop a cork and pour it up\nLife in the fast lane -- you think talk'll slow us up?\nNuh-uh, never that, not in this lifetime\nThought the game was dead, it just got new lifeline\nI revived that real shit, y'all deprived from real shit\nSmall hood to all good, we strive like Will Smith\nFresh Prince of Bel-Air; flow sick, need health care\nThey ain't got nothing for the kid, I'm gonna need welfare\nHell yeah, she down, down like she upset\nI took her down two months ago, bitch ain't came up yet\nMoney over bitches, dirt on top of bitch niggas\nPut you in your place -- it happened to be a ditch, nigga\n\n[Hook: Fabolous]\nGet down now\nIf you gon do it, baby, then do it now\nCause later on I might not be on the shit that I'm on\nYour chance'll be gone\n\nSo get down now\nGet down now\nGet down now\nGet down now\n\n[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]\nStack the heavy bread away, sleep on the small bills\nEvil growing every day, keep on your toe heels\nBrung her Ecstasy, now she geeked off of four pills\nSnuck her from the blind side, screeched off on four wheels\nI'm so ill, too slick\nWith boys I get horse\nShe ain't really trying to pop the clique off, the chick tossed\nI think I fucked the world, six toys and lip gloss\nShe yelling for the Lord, I threw on my big cross\nI get mine, get yours -- I'm score-bound on fourth down\nDon't make us bring them bulldogs round, Georgetown\nVixens in great jeans, unzipped those since eighteen\nYou won't use me, use that strip pole to make clean\nI get high, space lean, enough clothes for ten troops\nSame time, I spend loot on BM's and Benz coupes\nPorsches and Lambos and 'raris for candles\nFront if you want, my four-five in my camo\nBlam-o! Don't touch 'less you wanna get burned up\nYour good girl's a renegade, I got her all the way turnt up\nBag dimes like ten a day, episodes in my first truck\nWe ain't gotta go home, we can go right there in the cut and..\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Get Down or Lay Down"}]}
