P. Lovecraft]\n\"I am writing under appreciable strain\nSince by tonight I should be no more\"\n\n*Casting spell*\n\n[Canibus]\nYo, my hands are dirty cause I shook yours\nYea, you tried to curse me cause I took yours\nBut where?, somewhere, nowhere near\nI walk where no man dares\nSo the world could share one man's fare\nMy cares are your cares\nYour tears are my tears\nWhen you talk to God, I eavesdrop on your prayers\nI eavesdrop on your prayers\nThe industry could not stop my career\nFuck your record sales, where's your skills at?\nYou gotta million fans, but you're still wack\nI can't feel that, what they've been exposed to is not real rap\nReal rap is like chemical crack\nI'm drippin' by my addiction is stealin' and bring it back\nI prove it on every single track; I prove it on every single track\nThis is real Hip-Hop before it became rap\nDo these magazines mention that? NO!\nDoes radio pay attention to that? NO!\nDo they thank us for representin' that? No!\nYou think I let 'em get away with that? NO!\nThey just use us, abuse us\nStupid fuckin' reality shows do not amuse us\nBut they don't give two fucks; I said they don't give two fucks\nNow it's all up to you, 'Bus...\n\n*Church bell sounds*"}]}
