Where the trust at?\"\nUsed iMessage to send my main bitch that, she still ain't hit me back\nI'mma pretend this gat is the place I\u2019m supposed to lay my head at\nLemme take this nap\n\n[Bridge:]\nIf you want me dead, gon' head and shoot me down\nIf you want me dead, gon' head and kill me now\nAnd I\u2019ve been dead\nI\u2019ve seen so many legs, arms, tear apart\nHow did this start?\nHow did this start?\nHow did this start?\nHow did this start?\n\n[Outro:]\nYou think it\u2019s wrong for me to die?\nShit, I\u2019ve been dead my whole life\nI'm still searching for what\u2019s right\nBut we all know I ain\u2019t right\nGotta stay focused, aye\n(You can cut it now.)"}], "artist": "Kevin Abstract"}
