C-Rayz Walz\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nSay, \u201cWord.\u201d  Say, \u201cLetter\u201d\nSay, \u201cUnite.\u201d  Say I\u2019m better (Come on)\nSay, \u201cWord.\u201d (Word)  Say, \u201cLetter\u201d\nSay, \u201cUnite.\u201d  Say I\u2019m better\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nThe mind-meddling flows define head and it shows you not\nFresh like a Bill Cosby sweater with holes.  Half-\n-ass, you wack on a whole, quick to fold\nUnder pressure like women in the laundry, surrounded by clothes.  You know\nA blind man will see more success than you.  Your thoughts\nBoil and turn your brain vegetable.  Your\nMind stews.  You\u2019ll simmer down, but soon\nYou\u2019ll get stabbed in the dome with a spoon, you stupid souphead\nWhat\u2019s cooking?  Looking pretty kooky in here\nTrying to be my friend and buy me beer?  Get the fuck out of here.  Don\u2019t you\nKnow the challenge of my talented flows give me enough\nSkills to play the piano with my toes? (Did you know?)\nMy symmetry is of scientifical slaughter, attacking\nYour nerve endings in alphabetical order like\nBefore the Ice Age, I\u2019ve been cool, playing bas-\n-ketball with your girl like, \u201cWhoo!  Watch the spin move\u201d\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nSay, \u201cWord.\u201d  Say, \u201cLetter\u201d\nSay, \u201cUnite.\u201d  Say I\u2019m better\nSay, \u201cWord.\u201d  Say, \u201cLetter\u201d\nSay, \u201cUnite.\u201d  Say I\u2019m better\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nNo pressure.  Fresh forever, clever with the best of lines, set\nTo stand the test of time\u2014all-terrain, all-weather.  My last\nRaps/Wraps stacked as a mummy uniform.  The last unicorn\nWriting cuneiform scribes in my human form.  I\nCatch wreck like the J room, bless the door.  I\u2019ll kill it\nB.  You see my energy swarm?  You feeling C?  Say\n\u201cWord,\u201d speak paragraph, make the average crash, driving them-\n-selves crazy on a narrative path.  Circle\nCircle, dot, dot.  Hip hop immune to wackness, sounds\nTight like Abercrombie & Fitch on black kids.  Half\nPast the monkey\u2019s ass, a quarter to the twenty-fives and juice\nFrom penny candy to a Pennywise suit.  This is\nIt!  Disturb the lie.  You heard the vibe.  Now feel the\nTruth as proof and pressure the mind\nThe pen and pendulum, sword and strategy\nI pity the fool who would choose to battle me\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nSay, \u201cWord.\u201d  Say, \u201cLetter\u201d\nSay, \u201cUnite.\u201d  Say I\u2019m better (Come on)\nSay, \u201cWord.\u201d  Say, \u201cLetter\u201d\nSay, \u201cUnite.\u201d  Say I\u2019m better\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nI\u2019m the\nMeaning of raw spitting\u2014you\u2019ve never seen glass.  You went\nTo SEGA Dreamcast for an audition.  Listen, the thoughts\nI think could make your shrink crippled.  I can smell\nWater, I\u2019ll see the color of tickle\u2014(Word?)\u2014red, yellow\nPurple, intellect, fiery breathe, spiritual\nRehearsal.  Physical commercial\u2019s death.  Oh\nWhat a tangled web we weave when you thought God\nBlessed you only when you sneezed\u2014indeed, my school\u2019s\nOn the roof to upgrade my education.  Like Ramon\nScheming on tracks at the nearest station, roaming\nThe bling is ringing in itself, so when the ring start\nBlinging, you\u2019ll think it\u2019s something else\u2014then I\u2019m felt.  The sce-\n-nario: my life\u2019s story on a popup video.  On some\nRun-D.M.C. shit, yelling \"Here We Go.\u201d  And it\u2019s\nNot you, so believe it\u2019s me, one of the\nSickest emcees since Eazy-E\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nSay, \u201cWord.\u201d  Say, \u201cLetter\u201d\nSay, \u201cUnite.\u201d  Say I\u2019m better\nSay, \u201cWord.\u201d  Say, \u201cLetter\u201d\nSay, \u201cUnite.\u201d  Say I\u2019m better"}]}
