Who knew?\n\n[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]\nTurned 7 to a 14, 14 to a whole thing\nLord knows it's a cold game, switched up on you hoes, mayne\nBig body take both lanes, backseat blowin' propane\nAll black, five gold chains\nYoung rich nigga bossed up on his own mayne\nMy new shit sound like it's \"Soul Train\"\nTookie Williams over Coltrane\nEric B by the rope chain\nRSC, we fo' sho bang\nTiny locs and they go crazy\nWhat you know about the dope game?\nWas you born in the 80's? Did your mama smoke cocaine?\nHave you ever seen a whole thang?\nWhat you drove through to the streets 'cause you grew up on short change?\nFucked up when the dope age\nIt remind me when these rappers drop duds and they clothes change\nHad the part with the low fade\nI would stand in front of Nix wit my sack for the whole day\nDrive-by's, that was road rage\nThen we park and hop out, learn levels to this whole thang\nOld school play the O'Jays\nTryna make a slow change, mama still slavin' for a low wage\nTryna\n\n[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle & Belly]\nDouble up\nThree or four times, I ain't tellin no lies, I just run it up\nNever let a hard time humble us\nDo-do-double up\nI ain't tellin' no lies, I just (yeah)\nI ain't tellin' no lies, I just\nFive, four, three two\nThat's time, I got, to you\nThat money, my dreams, come true\nMy life, in diamonds, who knew?\nWho knew? Who knew?\n\n[Post-Chorus: Belly & Dom Kennedy]\nI leave it behind if you let me\nI probably got drowned just to hold you down\nI'd jump off the ledge if you with me\nI'd break you up, you just let me down\nLet me down\nGot my All Money In chain too\nLet me down\n\n[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]\nIt's hard to catch what you can't see\nI grew up to be who I wanna be, so\nThe more niggas talk I'ma shine\nMight a been way before its time\nPosted wit my back against the wall\nLife is a bitch but she mine\nThe rag six deuce yeah it's mine\n\"The Westside II\", yeah it's mine\nWhat you know about\nYour poster on the wall like the dealership?\nLeave her in the bed, legs tremblin'\nGettin' banged on for your Pendleton's\nWhat you know about\nYour response be the reason you exist?\nLucky I ain't get caught up in the twist\nYoung nigga, blue pager on my hip so\nAs the champagne spill\nAnd the car accelerate and the beat gon' cry\nI be goin' to the bank at least three, four times\nGetting handshakes from the branch managers\nWe keep doing fly shit when the cameras cut\n\n[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle & Belly]\nDouble up\nThree or four times, I ain't tellin no lies, I just run it up\nNever let a hard time humble us\nDo-do-double up\nI ain't tellin' no lies, I just (yeah)\nI ain't tellin' no lies, I just\nFive, four, three two\nThat's time, I got, to you\nThat money, my dreams, come true\nMy life, in diamonds, who knew?\nWho knew?
