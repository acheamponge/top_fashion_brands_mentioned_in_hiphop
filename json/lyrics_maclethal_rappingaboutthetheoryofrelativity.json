You're on Earth, and Earth is moving through space\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nEarth is moving relative to the Sun and uh\nThe Sun is moving relative to the Earth and uh\nThey're both moving relative to the Galaxy\nWhich is moving relative to the Universe\nNow, idea two of Special Relativity states:\nThe Speed of Light always moves at the same speed\nIt don't matter what source it's from\nIt could be coming from an iPhone, or coming from the Sun\nThe light from this flashlight\nAnd the light from this light sabre\nMove at the exact same speed\nBut depending on where you're at in the Universe\u2026\nAnd how fast you're moving\nYou might see them differently\n\n[Verse 4]\nThis is General Relativity:\nLet's say Time is a road paved with Space\nThere's no beginning or no ending\nThe Speed of Light is the speed limit\nAnd the faster that you move on the road\nThe more the road starts bending\nBecause the faster that an object moves\nThe bigger the object gets\nThe more it pushes Space to slope downward\nAs Time slows down and Gravity gets more dense\nThat's the reason Earth revolves around the Sun\nThe mass from the Sun pushes down Space-Time\nEarth rides the curvature of the Sun's Gravity\nBut if the Sun was gone, Earth would move in a straight line\nSo in conclusion: Space is the same thing as Time\nThey're not separate, they're intertwined\nIt's a behaviour, an action\nThe movement of atoms\nCoordinates in the Universe for which things happen\nYou can set two stopwatches to the same time\nBut Gravity could make them both tick at different speeds\nGPS has to use Relativity to work\nIt's not a hypothesis it's guaranteed\n\n[Outro]\nOkay, I'm gonna end the video now\nThis was a challenge to make \u2014 I learned a lot\nI'm feeling proud\nSometimes it's not about the reason, why? Or How?\nIt's simply what the Universe allows", "year": "2018-09-13", "album": "YouTube", "title": "Rapping About the Theory of Relativity"}], "artist": "Mac Lethal"}
