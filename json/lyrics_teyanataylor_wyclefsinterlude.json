It's your boy, Wyclef Jean\nI'm giving you this call, I'm all the way out in the islands, checkin' up on you\nI gotta tell you, the mixtape is very, very crazy\nI just wanted to call you\u2014I gotta tell you things to look out for, you know what I mean?\n'Cause I came in the game I was like what, like 14, 15 years old when I came in the game\nI couldn't even speak English, you know what I mean?\nI came from Haiti coming to America, like that Eddie Murphy story Coming to America, real talk, that was my story\nOne of the things I remember they telling me is you boat people, you ain't never gonna make it\nSo if somebody has time to concentrate on you 24 hours, hatin' on you, tellin' you ain't gonna be successful, tellin' you you different, tellin' you you ain't gon' go nowhere, that's when you know you have a shot to get to the top\nSo what you do is you take all that hate, all that aggression, all that hate, and you turn it into some good music, you know what I mean, and you bound for nothin' but success, you know what I mean?\nBut when you get up there, you know, invest that money right, don't blow it, you know what I mean?\nBuy some buildings, you know what I mean?\nOccupy some buildings, you know what I mean?\nGet your neighborhood back, you know what I mean?\nPut some people to work\nIt's your boy Wyclef, you know what it is, words of wisdom\nAite TT, love you\nAnd you are sexy as fuck! I'm out"}], "artist": "Teyana Taylor"}
