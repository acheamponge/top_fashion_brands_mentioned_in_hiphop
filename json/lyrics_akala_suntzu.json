Ah bless your soul\nYou ain\u2019t ready for the Shaolin vibes\nWake up when it\u2019s still dark in the sky\nWith the heart for the grind and an art full of rhymes\nAnd the sharpest of lines and a spark of the mind\nSo bright that I\u2019m leaving them partially blind\n\n[Refrain]\nAny which way some of you want to come through\nI\u2019m ready for you like Sun Tzu\nReady for you like Sun Tzu\nReady for you like Sun Tzu\nAny which way some of you want to come through\nI\u2019m ready for you like Sun Tzu\nReady for you like Sun Tzu\nReady for you like Sun Tzu\n\n[Hook: Asheber]\nDon\u2019t be foolish\nWhat you want to test I for?\nI\u2019m a man on a mission\nDon\u2019t let I catch you slipping\nIt\u2019s no competition\nI\u2019ve been studying the art of war\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt\u2019s the hardest of times we\u2019re living in, isn\u2019t it?\nSo why ain\u2019t you disciplined just a little bit?\nLittle git, wanna throw a little hissy fit?\nHere\u2019s a question, tell me can you riddle it?\nDoes it take effort to make yourself really shit?\nOr is that your best that you\u2019re giving it?\nNah, it can\u2019t be\nWell, rhyming just ain\u2019t for everyone\nNow every little son of a gun seems to think\nFrom the moment they come out their mum they are the one\nWithout ever having what it takes to become\nTen lifetimes ain\u2019t enough\nI was a griot, I was a Sufi\nI was a Mayan priest but not in the movies\nI was a druid pouring out fluid\nBlessing the ancestors cos we come through them\nHundred more times I was born before\nBefore The Windrush came and Britain forever changed\nEnergy and memory it remains\nIn my veins and it don\u2019t take much to reclaim\nAll I gotta do is say my own name\nAnd the power of Greyskull reigns\nYes, ruthless student, nuisance mutant\nTrains with the Shaolin monks, I\u2019m reclusive\nName is a thousand thumps with a pool stick\nThat reigns on a silly little punk for the bullshit\nGame for a round, punch and we all kick\nElbows, knees, let\u2019s go for the full kit\nTell your G\u2019s I\u2019ll believe that they\u2019re all sick\nWhen I see degrees they achieve, we\u2019re talking\nA school called wisdom, you could go there anywhere\nYet you are never there\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt\u2019s the art of a warrior, heart of a foreigner\nThat\u2019s living in an all-white town from a toddler\nGraft that your body does half wanna honour us\nBut you've gotta tell them that you\u2019re past wanting followers\nA class for the coroners, who the ras wanna collar us?\nKill rate way past choleras\nLook at all the revellers, look at what a rebel does\nSekkle, metal can\u2019t settle us\nDope, but the CIA can\u2019t peddle us\nNope, we go for the throat what you telling us\nChoke, on the little hope that you\u2019re selling us\nJoke, I take Britain like Severus\nCult, it\u2019s the occult and its elements\nThey wanna reign high but we come to be levelers\nWe know the design and we\u2019re done with the evidence\nGo with the times get bun for the hell of it\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2015-03-30", "album": "Knowledge Is Power II", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7c518a58eebfd479e5ad2216b0cd1a85.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
