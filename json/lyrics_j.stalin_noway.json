Stalin]\nYou out your rabid ass mind, think I'm slippin' nigga?\nClear the field up\nAnd we don't rock with safeties\nMy compact .45, that's my lil baby\nFive-O hit the trap, we hit the back door\nNeighbors must have told 'em he was servin' out the window\nEverytime I ride, I got that strap up on my lap\nI been to jail, but I ain't goin' back\nShoe string with a Mac, bet I rock it like a chain\nNiggas playin' the same games, but we be playin' with them bricks\nWe don't draw attention, 'cause we don't box shit\nNiggas playin' the same games, but we be playin' with them bricks\nAnd We don't draw attention, 'cause we don't box shit\nShit\n\n[Hook: J.
