Project", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI wanna date all of y'all\nKiss you on the forehead 'fore you go to bed\nTell you tomorrow girl we're hitting the mall\nProblem solved\nLost a few pounds, need a new fit\nGot a new man, got a new whip\nGot a new life now you the new shit\nWish I could make love to all of y'all\nDo it to you real good like you never had\nMaking your mattress mad\nIf the walls could talk\nThey would call the law\nTell it all, tell it all\n\n[Hook]\nHeard you've been going through the worst\nYou had this coming\nWell I'm not Mr fix the hurt\nI'm just good karma, I'm just good karma\nHeard the world's been getting on your nerves\nYou had this coming\nWell I'm not Mr. fix the hurt\nI'm just good karma, take this good karma\n\n[Verse 2]\nI hope I reach all of y'all\nWhether in the dorm room or the break room or the radio in your car\nLet it touch your heart\nClose you eyes, take a deep breath\nPicture me, touching you\nDoing what you want me to\nI wanna get all of y'all\nIn the same place on the same day\nAt the same time girl I ain't lying\nIf the walls could talk\nThey would call the law\nAnd tell it all, yeah\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Break]\nYou know this is just procedure baby, you really deserve this\n(You deserve everything, yeah)\nYou just reaping what you sewed, this is all for you baby, all for you\nKarma comes in a lot of ways, and you just happen to be looking at one of 'em. So baby please, close your eyes\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "BJ the Chicago Kid"}
