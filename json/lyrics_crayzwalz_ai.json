You don't wanna try that\nI'm the type to say \"Bye\" to Jill, then \"Hi Jack\"/hijack your hi-hat\nIn this, I'm Nat.  Damn, no love lost\nBeyond Volume One.  Fams, take gloves off\nDon't get it twisted.  There's crack in the weed sack\nAnd I'mma burn Phillies \u2018til I get my Sun Cycle tees back\u2014believe that\nBoy, girl, penis, or tits, it don't matter\nI'mma stomp that ass into quick pancake batter\nScatter my daggers (Too visual).  Make your landscape shatter\nStagger your data with laughter in this mad chapter\nI don't give a fuck (What?).  Beyond stuck, I'm crazy wet\nPhone ringing off the hook, dog barking, baby's wet\nAnd I ain't even make up my bed\nMake up my face?  I'd rather make up my mind instead\nStay focused\nIn the land of the culprits\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\n(I) build degrees and keep it hyper\n(I) kill MCs to meet they ghost writers\n(I) not concerned with who's hotter than who\nI (I, I) bring my own heat\u2014the Sun Cycle\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nIf you owe me a check, in the long run, you owe me your neck\nBe ready for cold war\u2014this is Soviet threat\nI rep Stronghold, a hard act to follow\nThe truth hurts\u2014that's a hard axe to swallow\nTen thousand sold, 12 inch gold without a dime\n\u201cThe Specialist\u201d\u2014you'll see my \u201cPerspective\u201d in time\nUsing common sense, your train of thoughts at the station (Boom boom)\nAnd all that fake shit.  Get the fuck out my face, bitch\nThe top dog gets his vaccination.  What?\nSee how not minding your business is real creative?  Us\nI inspire to retire liars who wanna try us, rhyme buyers\nGetting higher than most frequent fliers\nLive wire facts from the tracks.  Sire staff lie attract\nIn my PackFM knapsack for most rap buyers\nI hate rivers\u2014that's why I kill flows\nAnd y'all dicks reflect each other like double-headed dildos\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\n(I) build degrees and keep it hyper\n(I) kill MCs to meet they ghost writers\n(I) not concerned with who's hotter than who\nI (I, I) bring my own heat\u2014the Sun Cycle\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nI spit on your grave while I'm ripping the flav\nAliens in Wonderland got Alice afraid\nJumping out white Broncos with a bloody, muddy glove\nKilling it, trying to get fat off rap like Buddy Love\nIn my effect, my reality sparks danger\nThe stark angel of death marks players\nAnd six shots through your chest\u2019ll have you breathing like Darth Vader\nOn a respirator\nC-Rayz Walz shine brighter than car fenders\nAnd for the right price I'll serve anyone like bartenders\nHardly a herb.  Beat you to death with godly words\nThey'll have me calling niggas out like the Army Reserves\nYour majesty's capacity anti-gravity\nI'm the apocalypse\u2014none shall flow after me\nBefore I fax this message and get my stats out\nDrop my balls before I smack jacks out your mouth (Okay)\nNo doubt\nThat's a wrap.  I'm out"}]}
