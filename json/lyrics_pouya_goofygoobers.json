Fuck it\nLet's chop it up like Obi Wan Kenobi\nEatin expired cheese so when i spit its funky\nTake the light out my spot\nIts for the love of money middle finger to you bops\n5 and 0 Charlie Sheen but motherfuck the cops\nIm on my winnin' streak fuck the hoe until she feelin weak\nBabygirl dont talk just let the pussy speak [x2]\nIm on my supermodel flow finister\nMortal combat get her wet then i finish her\nShe pop that pussy open time for dinner sir [x2]\nLayin' in the bed layin' lyrics down\nCause once you get a little buzz ladies come around, haters come around, foes come around\nPeople put you down so they feel better, but they don't know better\n\n[Outro x2]\nWatch your back\nDon\u2019t fuck with the rats\nPick up the slack\nComin and rippin it just like that\nHaters on my back\nThat\u2019s where they stab\nRight in your back\nSo turn around before they do that\nBefore they do that that that that", "year": "2013-02-05"}]}
