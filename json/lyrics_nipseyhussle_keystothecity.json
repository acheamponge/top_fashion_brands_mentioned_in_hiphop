Make sex scenes so irrelevant\nForget about the risk we took, I never can\nRebel in this white man's world until they bury him\nBeing broke is so un-American\nThat's why I'm screaming all money Till the End!\n\n\nChorus:\n...\nAnd I stay...\nCause I do what I need\nAnd that's the reason that they love me\nCause I've been making money\nThe keys to my city!\nIt feels good to be on top, I got the keys to the city!\nThis is how it feels to be a big shot!\n\nPull up the old school, me and lil Shady Blue\nFresh up out the County jail, they held us up without no bail\nTen stacks to my lawyer, said a plan so we prevail\nJealous niggas hated that love to see a nigga fail\nMiss me with that \"Bro I love you\"\nSuck a nigga beef for real\nFake as 4 dollar bills\nHit the gas, we out of here!\nOh no, wait! A fox heels, spinning like we got a meal\nSmoked so mush Kush got us feeling we off a Pill\nThey know we got dollar still\nAnd bitches know we got the bill\nEating ..  Been here daily, drive my baby momma crazy\nName a nigga that could faze me\nPussy dad does not persuade me\nI swear I'll make them hate me\nPlus we never shop at Macy's\nLouis V, Gucci, maybe\n... Blue Mercedes\nWe were both familiar faces\nSpinning faster, dogging cases\n... Bring the cases, that's what we told the waitress\n... For all you try to play us\n\nChorus:\n...\nAnd I stay...\nCause I do what I need\nAnd that's the reason that they love me\nCause I've been making money\nThe keys to my city!\nIt feels good to be on top, I got the keys to the city!\nThis is how it feels to be a big shot!\n\nPlus, plus, straight pants,...\nYou thought that I'll be dead doing life, cause what I rap is true\n\nJust another you know who\nSam had some time to do\nAnd yea, Steve is cool, but I heard Mick used an animal\nFuck with what they were talking about\nWe just did what we had to do\nIt became the most valuable, after I dropped that on you tube\nFrom the West Coast at least, and for the West Coast I speak\nCause I'm filled with guilt,...\nWhere I'm supposed to be\nI'll be yours... Been this shit\nYou all forgot to...\nAnd like the... My pistol will smoke for free\nIf money ain't got no on streets\nGot to keep her close to me\nPut that on the man that's on the cross...\nIt wasn't always banking but I speak about it openly\nNo shame in my game\nI did my thing, go in... Streets\nWho's the hottest on the West\nAll you niggers know it's me\nSo tell whoever had the luck that Nipsey Hussle stole the key\n\nChorus:\n...\nAnd I stay...\nCause I do what I need\nAnd that's the reason that they love me\nCause I've been making money\nThe keys to my city!\nIt feels good to be on top, I got the keys to the city!\nThis is how it feels to be a big shot"}], "artist": "Nipsey Hussle"}
