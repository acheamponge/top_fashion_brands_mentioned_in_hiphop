see how many of em run from me\nGuerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear\nCause they don't love a nigga here\nGuerilla till I die, mama don't cry\nWhen they come for me, if I blast\nWe gon see how many of em run from me\nGuerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear\nCause they don't love a nigga here\n\n[Verse 1: Z-Ro & Taz ]\nAmerican me\nCould it be my own mob is out to murder me?\nI'm ready to kill, and I'm ready to die\nBut have these cowards heard of me?\nThe rumors are real, better keep your Glock cocked\nLeaving em stiffer than a statue\nReady to defend my guerilla maab by any means\nAnd I'd murder if I have to\nHeard my homie's working as an undercover\nReady to kiss my cheek, and earn your silver pieces\nCould it be that I've seen my last supper?\nMighty Jahova, please protect my spirit from the danger\nAnd I know you said you would strike down upon thee\nWith great vengeance and furious anger\nThose who attempt to poison your brothers\nWas it nothing but the word of God\nThat kept a nigga from taking the lives of so many others?\nAnd I'm trying to keep my ways right, but every mother's day\nI'm bawling around a gravesite, pud punk I hate you to death\nBut yet I loved you so, wanted you to feel my pain since '91\nSo brother come with me, and die slow\nI hate you to death, but yet I loved you so\nWanted you to feel my pain since 91\nSo brother come with me, and die slow\n\n[Chorus]\nGuerilla till I die, mama don't cry\nWhen they come for me, if I blast\nWe gon see how many of em run from me\nGuerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear\nCause they don't love a nigga here\nGuerilla till I die, mama don't cry\nWhen they come for me, if I blast\nWe gon see how many of em run from me\nGuerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear\nCause they don't love a nigga here\n\n[Verse 2: Taz]\nAs my life flashes before my eyes\nVisions of wicked ways, keep me puzzled\nWondering why I was introduced to a life\nFilled with drama and trouble\nAnd everyone's always got something to say\nWhen I come around, when I clown\nOn the DL, smile in my face\nAnd stab me in my back, when I turn around\nAnd I can feel hateful eyes, watching plotting to get me\nThey underestimate me, and hate me\nBut never approach, cause they can't fade me\nAnd I'll be damned if I go softly, shouldn't of crossed me\nGuerilla till I die, and I'mma blast when they come for me\nPlease tell me is there a place, where my guerillas could seek refuge\n'Cause it seems each time we gain one, that's one more we lose\nWhatever the rules, whatever you choose, whatever you give, I accept\nJust let me twist up one and smoke one for the world before my last breath\nHow can I go on, how can I take away my anguish\nA permanent frown on my face, cause non-guerillas are strangers\nAnd nobody knows my soul, so I show no fear\nMobbing till I die, cause they don't love a nigga here\n\n[Chorus]\nGuerilla till I die, mama don't cry\nWhen they come for me, if I blast\nWe gon see how many of em run from me\nGuerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear\nCause they don't love a nigga here\nGuerilla till I die, mama don't cry\nWhen they come for me, if I blast\nWe gon see how many of em run from me\nGuerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear\nCause they don't love a nigga here\n\n[Verse 3: Z-Ro]\nCould it be I'm too good for hell?\nHeaven don't want me, because I keep slippin'\nEven though I do drugs I still preach to motherfuckers\nAbout how to be Christians\nI got a problem I suppose, but I know\nI'm gon' solve it with a 4-4, ten sticks of fry\nAnd about 25 Tylenol 4's\nBut they tell me to hold my head up and finish my tape\nBecause its gon jam\nDo they really respect my music, or hang around Z-Ro just to meet Bam?\nI really don't know, all I can say, that I don't trust not a man on this earth\nBeen that way, ever since my birth\nAnd it's gonna stay that-a-away till I'm down in the dirt\nNiggas, are raising up out of my business\nIs something they better do, but I may hit the cut\nWith a pocket full of rocks, and I won't leave\nUntil I got rich, and who gotta put it down to the bullets\nDump a lot of bullets, till the job done\nTill a nigga really wanna, kill myself\nNigga shut the fuck up, while my record is spinning\nI'm really trying to feel myself\nGotta get em all, gotta get em dead\nWhen I'm filling the bed, put the infrared to the head\nEverybody come up dead, better roll on or get stole on\nNigga really better gone on, cause I just can't hold on\nI'm ready to kill and I'm ready to die, with nuts of steel\nLiving on the motherfucking edge\nNigga don't run up, because its real\nNigga can you feel me\n\n[Chorus]\nGuerilla till I die, mama don't cry\nWhen they come for me, if I blast\nWe gon see how many of em run from me\nGuerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear\nCause they don't love a nigga here\nGuerilla till I die, mama don't cry\nWhen they come for me, if I blast\nWe gon see how many of em run from me\nGuerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear\nCause they don't love a nigga here\nGuerilla till I die, mama don't cry\nWhen they come for me, if I blast\nWe gon see how many of em run from me\nGuerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear\nCause they don't love a nigga here\nGuerilla till I die, mama don't cry\nWhen they come for me, if I blast\nWe gon see how many of em run from me\nGuerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear\nCause they don't love a nigga here", "year": "1998-06-16", "image": "https://images.genius.com/50eb430b755a13059c2a4c05d5d2b239.500x496x1.jpg"}]}
