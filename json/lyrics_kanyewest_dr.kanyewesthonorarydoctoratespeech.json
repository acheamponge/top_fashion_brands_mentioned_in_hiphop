Your visionary and ambitious career is a true reflection of the creative spirit. So, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Board of Governors of the School of the Arts Institute of Chicago and the Board of Trustees of the Art Institute of Chicago, I now confer upon you the degree of Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts, Dr. West\n\nDr. Kanye West: I\u2019m sorry, that was just my opinion\n\nI am a pop artist. So, my medium is public opinion and the world is my canvas\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d is something that you can use a lot. It gives you the opportunity to give your opinion, apologize for it, and give your opinion again. People say you should not be sorry for your opinions. George Bush\u2026 has some very cool self-portraits. I didn\u2019t know he was an artist\n\nI felt my nerves a bit, and I don\u2019t feel that feeling a lot. The nerves of humility and modesty when being honored; a humanization, a reality of being recognized. And all I thought as I sit here kinda shaking a little bit is \u201cI need to get rid of that feeling.\u201d I need to not be nervous\n\nThis honor is gonna make your lives easier. Two reasons: you don\u2019t have to defend me as much, and I\u2019m gonna make all of our lives easier. And it\u2019s these Floyd Mayweather belts that are needed to prove what I\u2019ve been saying my entire life. Whether it\u2019s the cosign of Paul McCartney grabbing me and saying, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, he doesn\u2019t bite white people,\u201d or the New York Times cover, or the Time \u201cMost Influential\u201d cover, and now a doctorate at The Art Institute of Chicago\n\nWhen I was giving a lecture at Oxford, I brought up this school because when I went on that mission to create in other spaces \u2013 apparel, film, performance \u2013 it would have been easier if I could have said: \"I have a degree at the Art Institute of Chicago.\"\n\nThank you"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
