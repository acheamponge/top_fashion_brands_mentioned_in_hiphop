No, no\nMy parents are 1 and 2, and I am their child\nI am 3, I am the wild\nI am free\nWe are the children that sing the ancient song\nAnd we can sing it very well\nBut there's still so much to learn\nThere's still so much to earn\nBut I yearn\n\nWho am I scared\nWho cut us open\nTiyawn\n\n[Verse 2]\nOrganization and classification is ruining the hearts of our generation\nI said it\nBut actually, True told me that\nTrue made the map\nTrue took us to the forest to the top of the mountain\n\nIt's true, it's true, it's true\nHe told me to get on the mic and spit what's in my lung\nI tried to say, I tried to tell him\n\"Boy, I don't do that, I don't do the things that you do\"\nBut then he looked at me and said, \"You do, you do\"\n[?] got face too, went into my room at night\nThey tried to talk about who\nAnd I'm like, \"Let me sleep\"\nBut they just wake me up\nThey just try to tell me the things I know already\nIn my cerebral capacity\nBut it's locked, why can't I get in?\nMaybe I should ask Finn, maybe I should ask Jake\nMaybe we go to a lake that I found\nMaybe we go right now\nAnd it's snowing but it's warm outside\nWrite a letter on the beach at night\nGo to bed and then I see those lights\nI see those lights, I see their eyes\nStaring back at me, telling me about the symmetry\nTelling me about atomic structure\nThe way she loves her, the way\nThe ocean rolls around and 'round and 'round\nAnd 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round\nAnd the Taurus goes around and down\nAnd down and down and down and down, it never stops\nNever rock\nI call it crystal, now you call it rock\nI'm in the spot\nYou don't want to walk around on the hot coals of self-acceptance\nMan I get you, MSFTS here to rep yah\nWe'll do this together\n\n[Outro]\nOrganization and classification is ruining the souls of our generation\nWe said it\nAnd the kids know very well\nAnd the kids will dig the well\nDeep inside of their third eye and get all the messages inside", "image": "https://images.genius.com/47e950d4037e02d2f0c7a9888f03b3dd.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "ARDIPITHECUS", "title": "Organization & Classification"}]}
