Whatever he does prospers\n\n[Hook]\nNow let this mothafucka rise until you feel the soul\nNow let this mothafucka rise until you feel the soul\nNow let this mothafucka rise until you feel the soul\nTo change the way the people thinkin'\nLord that's my only goal\n\n[Verse 2]\nFuck a platinum plaque, bitch I want some monuments\nA sacrificial concubine with 12 o' clock masters\nA masters and doctorate for the bastards that I've indoctrinated\nSpit the body of Christ, you sip it, you feel intoxicated\nNow I ain't stoppin' 'til I reach the fuckin precipice\nSayin' my Hail Mary's I'm spiritually invested\nPuttin' scriptures together, I'm craftin' 'em with some message\nThis blasphemous nepotism is older than Nefertiti\nThat's evident in my rhymes and we edit that for your T.V\nThe Bible's my dictionary contingent upon convictions\n'Cause Jesus wasn't weepin' from the pain of crucifixion\nBut the loss of innocence within the truth that he had givin'\nMy flow is Old English like it's Victorian diction\nWhen I spit it's automatic like weapons with ammunition\nI fire with repetition then I throw another clip in\nAnd aim it at my sins so I eternally glisten, AH!\n\n[Hook]\nNow let this mothafucka rise until you feel the soul\nNow let this mothafucka rise until you feel the soul\nNow let this mothafucka rise until you feel the soul\nTo change the way the people thinkin'\nLord that's my only goal\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe properties of distention make you mentally dependent\nWhen you focus on the pendant instead of words in the sentence\nConceptions of this irreverence was birthed by Mary Magdalene\nI'll never trust my Reverend for pedophilic malevolence\nSlice the wrists of a hypocrite, spittin' the sickest ignorance\nIllegal drug smoke is engulfed in my own chest\nAnother breath and I'ma visit Pope Benedict in the flesh\nStrategizin' in the Vatican to start a new religion\nThey fiendin', they need it, they want it, I seen it\nSaid open your conscious so you can receive it\nI'm spittin' the truth and I hope you believe it\nI write on the page 'til the paper is bleedin'\nI'm hopin' my prophecies come to fruition\nI murder all men, man I kill competition\nI'm breakin' away with the skill that I'm given\nGet back to my roots with the way that I whip it\nGet back to the truth with the way that I spit it\nYour cup runneth over the way that I fill it\nMy style's illicit my flow is the ill-est\nJust give me a beat and you know that I kill it\nI studied the legends that all came before me\nI'm bumpin' Rakim 'til my systems exploding\nA cyst on your brain that insists on imploding\nCreated a movie my vision is gory\nI wrote this multivious biblical story\nI pray that the people embrace and endorse it\nThese words out my mouth are salvation and glory\nBut shit is a shame when no one will endorse it\nI'm guessin' the money is way more important\nI do it this way for some clarification\nThat's rarefied there in the rhymes that I've written\nAnd all that I covet's the mind I was given"}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
