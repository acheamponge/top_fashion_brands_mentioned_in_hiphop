I think that's literal hypocrisy\nAnd fuck the constitution, that's just an idiosyncrasy\nThe words \"pursuit of happiness\" scribbled by slaveowners\nMalt liquor for your liver, no longer an organ donor\nFastest way to kill a people is diminishing their minds\nGive them drugs of different kinds, good grapes from a vine\nThey choose to procrastinate and waste all of your fucking time\nFuck getting educated, niggas getting medicated\nPopping pills like they vitamins\nOxycontins & Vicodin\nBut don't forget the weed and make sure that the odor's pungent\nWe living in a society that praises over-indulgence\nMy generation's either locked up or on the substance\nThese niggas lack focus, always into dumb shit\nI practice what I preach and watch the people that I run with\nThe truth is in my rhymes, that's divine & sublime\nComing directly at your face like that officer's mace\nSo get the fuck off of the couch and stop waiting on a meal ticket\nRap game full of ignorance\nAm I the only one to find that shit sickening?"}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
