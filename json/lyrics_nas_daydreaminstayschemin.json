What!\n\n[Verse 1]\nLooking back in time, when I had on my shine\nI saw you standing there\nI never tried to diss you, you didn't need your pistol\nWhy did you have to take it there\nBut then again, it was just my imagination\nWhen my crew told me it was you that was player hating\nThen we had to have that terrible confrontation\nThere's nothing I can do to help this situation...\n\n[Hook]\nStay scheming (ya niggas kill me)\nNiggas wanna get at me\nStay scheming\nNiggas wanna get at me\n\n[Verse 2]\nIts been awhile since the last time we hung out\nFull of weed, drinking henny until we all passed out\nStretch bently, Queens clique, pushing mean whips\nAnd ho I'm with, glad who see she with\nShorty with the don\nMe and horse switch cars\nJazz ruff for the six, this is it par\nThug nigga never thought I get this far\nWho is that icing me from over there in the fog?\nYou got the mack god, you got the gat par\nDam, why they gotta do it to the black god\nEverytime we chilling niggas want to act hard\nMy nigga Jungle known to slap a nigga back-ward\nSo we chill pay no mind, think about about shit\nI'm for the love of it\nStubborn niggas always plotting on the brother tip\nCan't even chill cause niggas just\n\n[Hook]\nStay scheming\nNiggas wanna get at me\nStay scheming\nNiggas wanna kidnap me\n\n[Outro]\nBut they never do it motherfuckers..."}], "artist": "Nas"}
