Kelly]\nNo matter what ya'll say or do\nWe gotta get this money\nWatch out playa, we come for you\nTake all of your honies\nFirst of the month and rent is due\nWe gotta get this paper\nCome for us, we'll wait for you\nA million men can't take us\n\n[Chorus: Tone]\nDid you ever think that you would be this rich\nDid you ever think that you would have these hits\nDid you ever think that you would be the don\nHave a crib with a fifty acre lawn\nDid you ever think that you would be this paid\nWere there times when your ass was real afraid\nDid you ever think that you would sell out tours\nHave a show with fifty million viewers\n\n[Verse 1: R. Kelly]\nI used to think about how I was gonna make it\nStruggling day to day just trying to get this paper\nHoping the day would come when things would go my way\nBut now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say\n\n[Chorus: Tone]\nDid you ever think that you would be this rich\nDid you ever think that you would have these hits\nDid you ever think that you would be the don\nHave a crib with a fifty acre lawn\nDid you ever think that you would be this paid\nWere there times when your ass was real afraid\nDid you ever think that you would sell out tours\nHave a show with fifty million viewers\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nHey yo\nNow who knows poverty like Robert and me\nDid you ever think you'd be dancin' and vibin' with me\nDid you ever think you'd push a Ferrari, blast a Nas CD\nWith 5 TV's and DVD's, come on ride with me\nAin't naan nigga fly like me\nHoney you heard about the style I got\nWe from the wildest blocks, where police\nMake arrests, carry heat wear vests, we ghetto\nNever thought we'd ever reach this level\nMy people behind metal\nThe streets coulda had us, but now we live lavish\nOur freaks be the baddest\nBus 'em out while maids change the sheets on the mattress\nIt's deep cuz I never thought I'd reach this status\nWalk around and grown women stop and look\nThey recognize me, no longer hide they pocketbooks\nHate me now cuz I ain't gonna stop, you're stuck\nThe remix is R. Kelly, please drop the hook\nCome on\n\n[Chorus: Tone]\nDid you ever think that you would be this rich\nDid you ever think that you would have these hits\nDid you ever think that you would be the don\nHave a crib with a fifty acre lawn\nDid you ever think that you would be this paid\nWere there times when your ass was real afraid\nDid you ever think that you would sell out tours\nHave a show with fifty million viewers\n\n[Bridge: Tone]\nAmerica\nDid you ever think\nYa ever know\nDid ya ever think\nYa ever know\n(Come on)\nDid ya ever think\nYa ever know\nDid ya ever think\nYa ever know\n(Trackmasters)\n\n[Chorus: Tone]\nDid you ever think that you would be this rich\nDid you ever think that you would have these hits\nDid you ever think that you would be the don\nHave a crib with a fifty acre lawn\nDid you ever think that you would be this paid\nWere there times when your ass was real afraid\nDid you ever think that you would sell out tours\nHave a show with fifty million viewers\n\n[Bridge: R.
