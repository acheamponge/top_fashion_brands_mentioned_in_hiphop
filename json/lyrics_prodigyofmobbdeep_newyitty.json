Couple spins, this nigga is wack\nYou's a ugly dipshit, the black Craig Mack\nI'mma handsome shooter, I'll simple clutch the ruger\nAnd blow your bummer clout rot face to Bermuda\nI'mma mobster, wit' the two B's front to O\nYou pull my foul, all you gon' see is gold\nAnd platinum music, homey go make a hit\nWith 15 minutes of fame consider it a gift\n\n(Chorus) Prodigy X2", "year": "2008-04-22"}]}
