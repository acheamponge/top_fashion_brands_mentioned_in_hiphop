Mind your business\nIn my bag, until it's empty\nI really need somebody with me\nI don't think nobody gets me\nAre you with me or against me?\nI stay grippy like I'm 50\nI ain't worried 'bout the police\nI can't blink without the [?]\nThey must think I caught a body\nExtortion without a shotty\nBobby stepping with my Whitney\nShe come through, I get her tipsy\nFuck her good, she call me Papi\nSwitch positions, give her options\nNow she wanna stay with me\nI say \"Sorry but I'm busy\"\nNow she calling me cocky\nIce on my pinky looking Rocky\nStack ten, got the pockets stupid\nStuck in the trenches, I was ruthless\nStuck on the bench, I couldn't do it\nMost of the bitches speak truth-less\nI swear I ain't got no time for it\nIf they can't make it, they copy it\nMe and my stylist are stylist\nWe pick out our outfits\nYou know I'ma body it\nI was just picking out colleges\nNow I'm performing at colleges\nI watch the money keep piling\nThey hate while they smiling\nI always acknowledge it\n\n[Chorus]\nBetter not come over 'round me\nThink in a Maserati\nGo fast, or go slow\nI think the feds is watching\nThink I'll be catching bodies\nAnd if they ask just say \"I don't\"\nBetter not come over Friday\nAre you gon' tell somebody?\nSay yes, or say no\nI think the feds is watching\nThink I'll be catching bodies\nAnd if they ask just say \"I don't\""}], "artist": "A Boogie Wit da Hoodie"}
