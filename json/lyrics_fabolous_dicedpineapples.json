so cold, pussy winter fresh\nReservations to eat and you\u2019re my dinner guest\nShawty cleaned up nice, never been a mess\nCould take a little pain, I see them tattoos in her flesh\nBut I ain\u2019t try to hurt her, \u2018cause i\u2019ve always been the best\nI\u2019m making my shawty feel it till she feel it in her chest\nSex excellent, get a hundred when I test\nI\u2019m a fan of her talent, so i\u2019ve always been impressed\nSex in the city on my black satin sheets\nWet as Hurricane Sandy on the Manhattan streets\nLit a few candles like my power hadn\u2019t reached\nThen I took you places that her last nigga hadn\u2019t reached\nBitch so bad know her parents went through hell\nSmart mouth when we argue, you would swear she went to Yale\nI wanna touch her, not using my hands\nMake her dance without using the bands\n\n[Chorus: Cassie]\nCall me crazy, shit, at least you call me\nFeels better when you let it out, don\u2019t it, boy?\nKnow is easy to get caught up in the morning\nWhen you say \u2018cause you\u2019re mad and you take it all back\nThen we fuck all night till things get right\nThen we fuck all night till things get right\n\n[Verse 2: Fabolous]\nThe club popping but she ain\u2019t trying go there\nHer friends know where she going every time she tell them \u201cnowhere\u201d\nI\u2019m the only one that get up in the vip\nMy money grown, baby, ain\u2019t no need to see id\nSlide her something just to come through, host money\nAt least niggas know you\u2019re getting through the most money\nClub my place, you wear what you wanna wear\nBut you\u2019re overdressed if you\u2019re wearing underwear\nI turn up, couple js to burn up\nCouple spots to hide out, now let that playlist right out\nWhere I live on sunday, her place monday\nHer hand in my pants, call that Al Bundy\nPull it out like a pistol, yo, kiss it on the balls like the dick the mistletoe\nTell her do the thing I like, best she listen, yo\nBad bitch good girl around the christmas, though\n\n[Chorus: Cassie]\nCall me crazy, shit, at least you call me\nFeels better when you let it out, don\u2019t it, boy?\nKnow is easy to get caught up in the morning\nWhen you say \u2018cause you\u2019re mad and you take it all back\nThen we fuck all night till things get right\nThen we fuck all night till things get right\n\n[Verse 3: Trey Songz]\nPussy sweeter than some fresh fruit\nShe gushing and I drink the best juice\nI\u2019m drinking till nothing left to\nAnd she playing with herself, too\nI be thinking about her all day\nShe perform like it\u2019s Broadway\nYeah, we hop in the range, she off top wit' the brain\nGot the windows down, broad day\nJust look at her, spectacular\nThrow her on the stove, flip her like a spatula\nOther niggas want her, but you see the niggas whack to her\nSide bitch tripping \u2018cause i\u2019ll never get back to her\nMy bitch like bitches, but none of my bitches bad to her\nShe\u2019s said \"Trigga, why I never seen her with a bad bitch?\"\nUnless she\u2019s meeting on these other bitches average\nHundred percent real while these bitches is plastic\nMoroccan goddess, she walk like she need her ass kissed\nWalk like she need her ass kissed\nDiced pineapples, super fine at you\nIf she\u2019s giving head, she\u2019s throwing her mind at you\nFuck these other bitches, nigga, she don\u2019t mind what you do\nI just wanna watch, I ain\u2019t taking time at you, dudes\nNever faking, why they hella friend?\nKeep it real with her, yeah, that\u2019s what she ever wants\nSomethin' 'bout to alchemy, she don't ever disappoint\nLondon on the balcony, we\u2019re about to smoke another joint\nMiami on the yacht, she pulling on my pistol saying how she love my cock\nMetaphoric bliss, shawty, you\u2019re the shit\nCouple days with her, man, that\u2019s all I ever get\nAnd she got a little sister, that\u2019s what she ever with\nGame like a nigga man, that\u2019s all she ever speak\nMontreal was our first time, swear pussy just like the first lines\nScars on my back, she left couple, spent a couple stacks, had her put a couple pair\nTry to beg mine, my nigga out of bootie\nNever retract statements, nigga, I\u2019m never scared\nNiggas be switching up, but nigga, I\u2019m never weird\nBack on another leer\nI leave niggas here, all in another year\nAll in another lane, all in another gear\nAll of you niggas lame, all of your niggas here\nListen up, bitch niggas bitching up\nI guess you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re supposed to\nLet a real nigga hold you\nBack to my baby girl though, I just need you in my world, yo\n\n[Chorus: Cassie]\nCall me crazy, shit, at least you call me\nFeels better when you let it out, don\u2019t it, boy?\nKnow is easy to get caught up in the morning\nWhen you say \u2018cause you\u2019re mad and you take it all back\nThen we fuck all night till things get right\nThen we fuck all night till things get right", "title": "Diced Pineapples"}]}
