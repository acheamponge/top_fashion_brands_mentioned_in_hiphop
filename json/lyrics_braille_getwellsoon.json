Today's special is\nBroken into many parts. It's served with a side of disappointment and garnished with anxiety. Although it seems like a heavy meal dessert will be much lighter. Please excuse my messy outward appearance but I assure you that this waitress is beautiful on the inside\nBy the way, get well soon. Right?\nYou're sick. Get well soon, man\nHope that thing clears up cause that is nasty\nYou been walking around carrying that?\n\n[Verse 1]\nGrab your bubble goose fleece, I'm cold blooded beast\nWhen I utter my speech so better beats for the most gutter streets\nTo the most luxurious I flow fast and furious The four cast is frigid\nFreestyle a written\nI'm a riot when I rip it [?]\nRippin' on the rhythm\nI don't rhyme about the frivolous forget about it\nAuthentic sugar plums plummet\nPassion in my voice because it comes from the stomach\nSo what you feed on is the type of tick you beat on\nFake fought a phenom, wake up dream on\nI stay and hide a man\nYou know China Japan\nCause I light up the jam\nNo magic tricks or slight of the hand\nBraille briz gonna sail to Brazil\nMove to Brazil\nGet well soon, the kid's ill\nI'm taking off, write me a card\nWhen I return I'm coming back on a lightening rod\n\n[Hook]\nWe gotta get well soon\nCause we're all so sick\nWe gotta get well soon\nCause we're all so sick\nGet well soon\nGet well soon\nGet well soon\nGet well soon\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm under the weather\nWhether the storm trying to get better\nWaitin' till the weather is warm but will it ever\nChange if I don't\nChange if all I do is complain\nThen it stays the same\nAnd I can't stay here, lets make that clear\nI don't want next year to be like last year\nI don't want to feel like I'm always trapped here\nIt's bigger than my record sales and rap career\nRap with me\nWhat if I snap like bear traps\nYou feel that like gorilla slaps on bare backs\nEmbarrass my enemies, expose the pharisees\nGive 'em a taste of their own disease\nAnd they don't like that, when animals attack\nWho gave the prisoners cannon balls and gat's\nWho's the real ones and who's the rats?\nIt's hard to tell cause the sickness is so easy to catch\n\n[Hook]\nWe gotta get well soon\nCause we're all so sick\nWe gotta get well soon\nCause we're all so sick\nGet well soon\nGet well soon\nGet well soon\nGet well soon\n\n[Verse 3]\nI hope it's not contagious\nSomebody call me a doctor\nI hope it's not contagious\nIf it is then you caught it\nI hope it's not contagious\nSomebody call me a doctor\nI hope it's not contagious\nIf it is then you caught it\nLord please won't you heal me\nOpen my eyes reveal the real me\nHelp me see, help me be healthy and free\nHelp me see, help me be healthy and free\nLord please won't you heal me\nOpen my eyes reveal the real me\nHelp me see, help me be healthy and free\nHelp me see, help me be healthy and free\n\n[Hook]\nWe gotta get well soon\nCause we're all so sick\nWe gotta get well soon\nCause we're all so sick\nGet well soon\nGet well soon\nGet well soon\nGet well soon", "year": "2010-04-27", "album": "Weapon Aid"}], "artist": "Braille"}
