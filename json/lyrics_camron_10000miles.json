Let's get this money, baby\nLet's get this money, baby\nAin't nothin' funny, baby\nLa-la-la-la-la\n\n[Chorus]\nLater on that night, I laid in my bed\nThem birds was chirpin', so I'm countin' up bread\nBut I can't get her up out my head\nOh man...  damn\nLater on that night, I laid in my bed\nThem birds was chirpin', so I'm countin' up bread\nBut I can't get her up out my head\nOh man...  damn"}]}
