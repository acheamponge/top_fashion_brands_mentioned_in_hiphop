Man, you think I'm stopping?\nI'm going hard for my people, gone not forgotten\n\n[Outro: Cappadonna (Q-Dini)]\nYo, Dini? (What up)\nYo, remember you used to be chasing them cars, man\nIn the streets (I'm saying them days is over for me, daddy)\nI hear that (remember them days, when you used to come through\nTo cut through the building, with the get ya on your side\nWith the fucking...) Mask on... yeah, son\nThem days is behind me, I'm saved now\n(So I guess it's safe to say, we gon' move forward with this)\nUntil them future songs, with a new psalm\n(Trying to Cappatilize) Off of everything we doing"}]}
