McVey", "title": "Happy Feelingz", "lyrics": "[Z-Ro]\nLately, my luck has taken a turn for the worse\nI used to ride in luxury now I'm headed for a hearse\nAt least it feels that way; my day-to-day is full of sufferin'\nMy headaches can't be relieved by aspirin or Bufferin\nAm I tougher than my problems? I like to think so\nBut every time I try to rise all I do is sink slow\nLike I'm out in the Pacific and my vessel capsized\nSeems like I been going through it since I got baptized\nMr. Jesus I can feel him all up in my bones\nCause he be giving me game on how to live my life long\nCan't forget about the angels at the psychiatric center\nHelping me to feel like I'm a winner\nGot me taking Lexapro, just so I can improve my mood\nIt got me feeling like I'm giant, all obstacles better move\nOr get flattened in the process of me reachin' to the top\nY'all know that I'm the cream of the crop\nAnd all my people say...\n\n[Hook]\nGetcho' ass up out my way Satan\nI got a mansion, robe, and a crown waitin'\nNever again will you catch me livin' in sin\nCause when the pearly gates open I wanna be steppin' in\nGetcho' ass up out my way Satan\nI got a mansion, robe, and a crown waitin'\nI do away with you devils so I can make it to the top\nAnd remain sane even when a nigga dealing with a lot\n\n[Z-Ro]\nI'm all alone but guess what that's all right\nFacing my fears and producing tears that's all night\nYeah I'm a grown man but I still cry sometimes\nCause I'm a sponge soaking up pain trying to come out the rain\nI been doing right all my life and still sufferin'\nWhile murders and crooks out there bubblin'\nI need a break, so many decisions to make\nI can't concentrate, cause everybody in my life is so fake\nAll the years that I wasted lovin' and tryin' to build\nWith somebody who was never even feeling me for real\nI thought I had a family but out the window it went\nWith all my legal problems and all this beefin with thirty cents\nI'm a loner, pillow to post, solo on the corner\nBitch don't know nothing 'bout Joseph she just want \"Z-Ro\" to bone her\nBut I'm old school till I'm in my burial plot\nI just need a lady to dig me when I'm dealin' with a lot\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Z-Ro]\nAin't no happy feelingz in the air\nSo lately I been searching for happiness through my prayers\nHoly Father, can you hear me when I'm down on my knees?\nI need a bridge over troubled water, save me please\nI'm just a lost soul tryin' to find his way back home\nEverything I love has been takin' away from me now I'm alone\nBut it's all good, tell me when the sun gon' shine\nOn this nothing ass motherfuckin life of mine\nMama it been 20 years since I seen yo face\nDo me a favor, ask god if I'm included in his grace\nCause I'm feeling abandoned like the last man standing\nSo much poverty and pain this ain't the way that I planned it\nAll I wanted was to make a little money and split\nTake care of my people and grow old with grandchildren and shit\nI'm still happy, even if my cases don't get dropped\nAnd remain sane even when a nigga dealing with a lot\n\n[Hook]", "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/8071cca9b63005db0a9a0c179a0e6a44.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
