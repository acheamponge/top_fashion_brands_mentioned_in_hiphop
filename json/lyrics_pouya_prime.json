She getting Randy Moss'd\nTo the lonely homie playing on that Sony Playstation\nNeed me a vacation, been feeling kinda famous, let's face it\n.44 by the waistline if somebody wanna play me\n'Case somebody wanna\nI'm writing lyrics in my desolate room\nWondering what would of happened\nIf I would've stayed in school\nProbably end up just like you\nSitting on the couch watching television\nWishing you was one of the motherfuckers on the television\nGet up off your ass and go and get you somethin'\nI see you talking 'bout it but you don't do nothin'\nI see you looking at me wanna get involved\nI can almost guarantee that you would take a loss\nYeah", "year": "2016-04-29"}]}
