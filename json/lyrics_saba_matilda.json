Well stop watching the lifetime channel\nCause this here is primetime ammo\nLike Janet, and the tit seen around the planet\nGet to know, like Bobby Brown and blow\nEverybody knows, like I\u2019m in the garden growing vegetables\nCause it shows, like I bruise easily\nLosings predetermined if we need to vis-\u00e0-vis\nThe unflappable vanguard\nYou already know it, fucking with me, you better come hard (no homo)\nMaybe that was out of order\nLike this whole courtroom, but there is no justice it\u2019s just us\nBrother\nBlack exploitation like the undercover brothers\n\n[Verse 2 \u2013 Saba]\nGet caught up in a reflection like kiddy pools\nMy art is like the babes in the video\nYou ain\u2019t touching me (bounce that ass)\nGet comfortable, class in session like summer school\nI\u2019m the last one standing like royal rumbles with 100 dudes\nSo who\u2019s that? You got a hunch or two?\nI\u2019m back like the hunchback after 300 lose (spartans)\nKing Leonidas, I\u2019m on top of my flow like Poseidon\nPissing on everything in the water coming through\nSo find me, with a gun and [?]\nBombing bodies at parties for nothing, just because it\u2019s fun to you\nSo turn up, turn up\nAin\u2019t no telling where you turn up, on the furniture or furnace\nBurn ya, iron and scorch and abort this mission\nI\u2019m sick of this like Aborigine must be pissed with location switching\nRadio station switching, please do not play that here man\nI bet they pay to see me, remake a pay for CD's\nLike screw your internet and your cable, push it to the max like beta\nSo I Dreamcast like a forecast, nigga it don\u2019t rain it\u2019s Sega\nVincent Vega, your diction is fiction\nI send it to you like my curtain then burp like I\u2019m finished with him\nMe and your girl bump and grind like a pendulum nigga\n\n[Outro]\nBack up in that ass\nFor the 9 dre\nAftermath production\nMotherfucker\nPIVOT!", "album": "GETCOMFORTable"}], "artist": "Saba"}
