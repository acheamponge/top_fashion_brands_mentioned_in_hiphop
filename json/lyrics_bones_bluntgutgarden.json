Kennedy sample]\nFor those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with, to be filled with, hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man\n\n[Verse: Bones]\nI'm in the garden with the roses\nCup full of oceans, Backwoods smoking\nRare rocks on my fingers\nFeeling like a young prince back in 1346\nMoats full of acid, ash on my mattress\nDrawbridge up, \"Thou shall not pass\"\nFine art on all the walls, bitch I make and break the laws\nHorse and buggy, no cars\nWhole village bow down\nStep up to my balcony and wave at the crowd\nCane made of emeralds, coins made of gold\nSpider silk robes, let them drag on the floor\nI never knew I'd be the one\nLooking in the mirror at the legend I've become\nI never knew I'd be the one\nLooking in the mirror at the legend I've become\nWhat?\nBones\nSESH\n\n[Outro: Robert F. Kennedy sample]\nWhat we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another", "image": "https://images.genius.com/86b77d819332b64b9de1c6fb6c17d105.960x960x1.jpg"}]}
