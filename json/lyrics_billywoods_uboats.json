(x2)\n\n[Verse 2]\n[Elucid]\nKaleidoscopic, black agnostic\nBought my burial plot on Craigslist, rock bottom discount\nExtinction agenda, supreme rallies [?] me\nBlack hoodie, black Timbs, oh the gods must be crazy\nPeonies and daisies, cocaine 80's\nCop killer queen, she raised me from the dregs\nDead lectures on a ship named Jesus\nSinkin' faster, it's all a trap\nAtlantic floor to hornet tabernacles\n\n[billy woods]\nOff the coast of Formosa, send them to the ocean floor\nNo mea culpa, send boys to war\nDeep water, she seemed gorgeous\nMap, they compass, gat in cutlass, boat black as dungeon\nSmoke crack pungent\nLeviathan looms, a hundred harpoons plunging\nThe loom winds its way to days of judgement\nYour doom finds you lying awake and lunges\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
