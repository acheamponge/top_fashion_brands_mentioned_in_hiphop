And I also think that's caused him to be very independent, which is- which is great. Like he's sitting here with a green hat and orange pants, and like a wrestling shirt on\nLove it\nAnd I don't know anybody else that would like out like that, but that's exactly what I like about him 'cause he's like, \"what? This is is it.\""}]}
