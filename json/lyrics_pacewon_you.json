Yo! Yo! Yo!\nLight a blunt, get pumped\nP-A-C-E\nLive entertainment, replace TV\nMade for the kids, the DJs and fiends\nMakin' y'all jam like freeways and streets (Screech!)\nI keep it moving like soul to soul\nRecord label, my whole team going gold\nDumbin' out\nYou run your mouth rapid\n'Till I see your face and I slap it\nYo! I'm a wizard at this\nWeave a spell, it's like magic\nTurn that bully boy into a faggot\nTurn that pig cop that been jockin' you right back to maggots\nTurn his blue steel into plastic\nYo! I turn boogie in the goodie, sit back and roll a fat one\nTurn a vinyl record into platinum\nTurn a real calm motherfucker to a thug that want action\nI'm here to heal the sick, I'm like aspirin\nYo! I walk on water like the saviour (Pacewon!)\nI declared war on the mayor\nYou know me, low key\nSittin' on my porch gettin' high I'm like Smokey\nChipped up celly\nCussin' out Sony (Where the fuck is my cheque?)\nYo! I don't just live by reputation\nI'm thuggin', with a weapon waitin'\nTo slug you\nLove to\nTreat me like Gotti when I come through\nRun crews, aunts and uncles I love\n\nI touch (You! You! You!)\nLet me set it off for (You! You! You!)\nAlways keep it raw for (You! You! You!)\nRock it to the core for (You! You! You!)\nYo! What you want? Yo! (You! You! You!)\nYo! Can't touch me (You! You! You!)\nMad 'cos your girl wanna...Uhhh (You! You! You!)\nWho got as much money (You! You! You!)\nYo! What you want?\n\nYo! I always think busy\nKeep the money crispy\nSmoke out back to back phillys\nLet's go half\nI got fifty\nYou fuckin' with a grisly\nHippie, make you feel jiggy\nMake your girl wanna fuck, wanna cuddle up and kiss me\nLicky, licky, tricky, dizzy, silly\nI don't need game, I just keep it on the real-ly\nBust shots like they 9 mill-y\n'Tis for my people in The Bricks\nFor my people out in Philly\nConnecticut, New York city\nBad Boy, see the no smokin' signs\nStill light a blitty\nDance around like P. Diddy\nGreedy motherfucker, don't care\nGrab your kitty by the titty\nShe love it\nLike Kim do Biggie (Huh!)\nDig me, the world move quickly\nKillin' off the weak and the sickly\nBelieve it or not it's like rippies\nSome niggas rap, some niggas flip keys\nSome bitches strip-tease\nSome work at Wimpy\nGotta crush, hot and heavy on an MC\nAnd like Fat Joe, jealous ones envy\nPacewon, you wanna be like me\nCarhartt cap on, new pair of Nikes\nVirgo vibes, might pull a Piscies\nToo close to Aries, turn out to be sheisty\nYo! I'm being watched by a strike team\nWanted by the feds before the age of nineteen\nYo! Yo! Be careful standin' by me\nI'm tricky, might slip a mickey in your ice cream\nYo! Yo! Yo! 'Till my day come\nBest regards all of y'all\nPacewon\n\nYou! You! You!\nYou! You! You!\nKeep it raw for (You! You! You!)\nRock it to the core for (You! You! You!)\nYo! What you want? Yo! (You! You! You!)\nYo! Can't touch me (You! You! You!)\nMad 'cos your girl wanna...Uhhh (You! You! You!)\nWho got as much money (You! You! You!)\nYo! What you want?", "year": null}]}
