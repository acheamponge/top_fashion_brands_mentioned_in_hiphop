It's Chris, he's on the other line with Diddy\nBut I don't wanna talk right now, my day is going shitty\nWhy's Jay rocking that Urkel look, man, isn't he from Marcy?\nThey say he's growin dreads and now he's talking like a Yardie\nMan, everything is changing, I don't understand a thing\nI guess this is that bullshit that all the money brings\nI'm on flight\n\n[Hook]\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy baby mama boyfriend like to talk like he can hurt me\nI'm laughing cause she kissed him in his mouth and gave him herpes\nThat just makes him one of 50 niggas wanting to murk me\nNiggas found my truck and burnt it up out there in Jersey\nYou can ask my son, he'll tell you \"my dad's fucking crazy\"\nShe filled his head with shit and now I think he fuckin' hates me\nShady didn't invent me but a star is what he made me\nI'll blow your fuckin' mind out if I told you what he paid me\nHe gave me all the pills he had left, that's why I'm so high\nIt makes me feel so good now that I'm not so scared to die\nI wish a nigga would, I dare a motherfucker try\nYou get at me and miss you kiss your black ass good-bye\nI'm on flight\n\n[Hook]\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy lawyers on retainers every month, I give \u2018em stacks\nIn case they wanna send me up for murder like Max\nMan I wasn't the shooter, I was never on the scene\nSo if they do forensics they'll find out it wasn't me\nThere's no need for a lie detector, I ain't sayin shit\nThe more you talk the higher chances you're doing a bid\nToday I read the paper, it said Tru Life caught a case\nThey said they found a victim with a knife stuck in his face\nI spoke to Michael Vick, I told him I'm happy he home\nYou tell them crackers sorry nigga then you get back on\nWhen dogs are fighting in the hood nobody gives a fuck\nSo you get back and shake it on the field, show them what's up\nI'm on flight\n\n[Hook]\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nOne-eighty-seven, one-eighty-seven\nDeparture from the hood, destination hell or heaven\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider\nI'm a rider, say I'm a rider", "year": "2009-11-09"}]}
