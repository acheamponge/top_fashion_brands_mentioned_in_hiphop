My deformed sculpture\nBeauty\u2019s in the eye of the beholder\nAnd the mic\u2019s in the hand of the soldier, storm ultra\nPerceptual extrasensory.  Now vision me\nA gaseous element that burnt down your ministry\nMACadocious, my rap ferocious\nLiving in the projects with rats and roaches\nThe theme\u2019s over when you fiend for culture\nBut ain\u2019t seen mean green since I steamed clean okra\nI hope to leave The Underground and overdose exposure\nNearsighted\u2014now everything seems closer\nBut I don\u2019t want to be a star\u2014I\u2019m might supernova\nGunning these bars.  You looking for change?  Check the sofa\nAnd I heard you doing hip hop too (Hahaha)\nToo bad it\u2019s not doing you (Aw, true)\n\n[Hook: Samples with DJ Sean One Scratches and (C-Rayz Walz)]\n\"Y'all could play the front line.

The difference between you and me:\nI\u2019m something real to feel\u2014you just something to see\nI shine behind bars like brothers in jail with jewelry\nYo, Shyne, behind these bars, peep the jewel, B\nReal recognize real, so I feel bad (Uh huh)\nYou was holding the steel, caught the raw deal.  I\u2019m real mad\nAnd after observing these fool-headed dragons bragging of wealth\nThe only thing left to do now is battle myself\nBut I\u2019m the illest emcee I seen in the world.  Only time\nI\u2019m not nice is when I\u2019m being mean to my girl\n\n[Hook: Samples with DJ Sean One Scratches and (C-Rayz Walz)]\n\"Y'all could play the front line.

All this unconscious bitching\nWhat\u2019s all the bullshit and bickering for?  How y\u2019all gonna change\nHip hop to a civil war?  (Come on).  When they\nFind you, pa, they find I\u2019m raw.  And I\u2019ll be here when y\u2019all\nGone like sediments of dinosaurs\nThose vagina whores are more like Golila\nOut to zap your strength, extinguish your fire\nDo the knowledge to the wisdom you\u2019re spitting, understand the vision\nOr get lost in the prism rhythm of spitting\nThe Limelight could turn to a sour lemon, and all good\nThings come to a end\u2014ask John Lennon\nThen \u201cImagine\u201d I\u2019m N.W.A., taking it Eazy\nBut just like a referee, \u201cthe game needs me\u201d (Sample from Jay Z - \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\")\nLast quarter.
