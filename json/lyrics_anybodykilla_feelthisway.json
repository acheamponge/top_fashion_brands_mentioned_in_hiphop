Someone help me, someone tell me\nWhy do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?\nWhy do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me\nWhy do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?\n\nI try to focus and just handle things that come my way\nDon't let shit get to me 'cause there will always be another day\nMaintain my emotions if I don't then I'll be sure to fall\nAnd I'll be damned to let myself desaulve. So you better get used to me\n\nWhy do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me\nWhy do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?\nWhy do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me\nWhy do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?\n\nThese nights are getting shorter, this ride is seeming longer\nWhen will it end? Even though I really don't want it to\nThese nights are getting shorter, this ride is seeming longer\nWhen will it end? Even though I really don't want it to\n\nThese nights are getting shorter, this ride is seeming longer\nWhen will it end? Even though I really don't want it to\nThese night are getting shorter, this ride is seeming longer\nWhen will it end? Even though I really don't want it to\n\nWhy do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me\nWhy do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?\nWhy do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me\nWhy do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?\n\nWhy do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me\nWhy do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?\nWhy do I feel this way?
