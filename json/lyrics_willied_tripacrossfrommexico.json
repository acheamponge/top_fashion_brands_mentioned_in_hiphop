Two hundred years later and the black man is still not free. The failure to appoint blacks to high government positions is just another form of slavery. I for one will never believe in equality until we're no longer on the outside looking in.)\n\n[Verse 3: Willie Dee]\nThey, I'm talking about the other race\nKidnapped us from our place\nThey didn't want us to have what it took\nSo those crooks hid the damn textbooks\nI wonder can I get y'all to drop the pipe\nAnd get high on life\nThe dopeman could give a damn if you live or die\nIt's time to get right\n\n(Come on, tell 'em)\nTrip across from Mexico\n\n[Verse 4: Willie Dee]\nThree homeboys in Houston\nOnce hit up a liquor store\nTwo got away, one got shot\nIn the back, went through the glass door\nHe died at the scene at the hands of a clerk\nThe [?] was hurt\nThe police got a good description\nOf a prime suspect\nThey knew his name, they knew his game\nThey knew from where he came\nThey went straight to his house, arrested him\nBegan to tamper with his brain\nThey threatened to incarcerate him for years\nUnless he snitched\nHe brought the story, broke his vow\nSurrendered his accomplice\nThe punk who plead bargain was sent to the pen\nDue for ten\nThe friend he turned in had people in the courts\nHe now resides in Oregon\nThe boy got the jacket, became a faggot\n'Cause nobody likes a snitch\nThey took his drawers, gave him panties\nNow he walks with a switch\nHe went to the warden, crying about the deal\nBack in '83\nSix years locked down, booty pound\nYet still no amnesty\nThe Warden just smiled and said\n\"Remember that brother you betrayed from the liquor store?\n\"Well that was my nephew, ho\"\nTrip across from Mexico\n\n(Go back, you dirty black)\n(Go back, you dirty black)\n\n[Outro:]\nTrip across from Mexico as defined by Willie Dee.
