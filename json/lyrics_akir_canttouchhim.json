But we\u2019ve been doing this for years, son.  And I\u2019ma explain something.  Yo, yo\n\n[Verse 1: AKIR]\nIller than ever, AKIR, the trendsetter appear like a\nBeretta bucking straight in your ear, the shots clear\nGot as my witness, my word is my bond.  Let\u2019s get\nIt on, write my life down, reflect it through song.  Running\nThis shit like a marathon.  Just getting warm, hotter\nThan summer sex, wet like the sweat from my balls\nSee, before I buy Smirnoff or Christian Dior\nI\u2019ll be busting nuts while your knees scraping the floor\nPick you up and drive you off and have \u2018em cleaning your drawers\nHad a wife.  She did me trife.  I ain\u2019t trusting these whores\n\u201cNo More Drama\u201d in my life like Mary J. Blige\nI\u2019m a king.  My entourage got to have new cards.  My fam\nDo music large like it was out the barge\nLivewire inspired by the niggas in charge\nFly, I\u2019m nasty with the shit I be on.  You just\nA peon.  My name\u2019s in neons, embraced for eons\n\n[Hook: AKIR] (x4)\nY\u2019all can\u2019t touch him\n\n[Verse 2: AKIR]\nYo, don\u2019t touch\nThe dial\u2014I\u2019ma keep it in tune.  Niggas is gassed like\nBalloons, showing their ass like baboons\nI don\u2019t wet it like Gremlins and chickens\nPretending they don\u2019t suck cock.  Now what the blood clot?\nHeart stop.  I\u2019m in the vein with my art\nResume pumping, I\u2019m thumping.  Stainless, I\u2019m sharp\nAnd, in the dark, I\u2019m sight.  I\u2019m like a hawk in the\nNight, spitting sparks for light to guide you through the flight\nLike Mike Tyson fights, I don\u2019t bark.  I bite\nI don\u2019t talk that hype.  I just do it like\nMikey.  Might be one of the most vivid since\nSpike Lee.  Hype bleed, the crowd gets in it\nTurn it out like the lights when we finish\nFinally, we did it.  Now ask, \u201cWho\u2019s the illest?\u201d\n\n[Hook: AKIR] (x4)\nY\u2019all can\u2019t touch him\n\n[Verse 3: AKIR]\nNever I claim to be the best, got respect for the vets\nThough I stay on your set like video cassettes, and the\nMediocracy leaves me bored.  Spit\nFreestyle cinema, produce the Scar\nTake different avenues and open new doors, but this\nTime, I\u2019ma rhyme using all metaphors\nGirl jock like Shaft, blow brains like gats\nRelease mainstream cream like this rap and\nShe can\u2019t save face like Mike Jack\nSon is a fag.  That\u2019s all he know about crack\nYou over here on some tracks.  I\u2019ll oversee like\nA MAC.  Hungry like turkey, spread like herpes, attack\nBack to basics, y\u2019all niggas still faking that wack shit.  Head for\nThe hills \u2018cause we only letting out classics, nigga\nY\u2019all can\u2019t touch him", "year": "2004-11-15", "album": "Street Edition Vol. 1 & 2", "image": "https://images.genius.com/509e7a4852ad536f53153265417b296d.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "AKIR"}
