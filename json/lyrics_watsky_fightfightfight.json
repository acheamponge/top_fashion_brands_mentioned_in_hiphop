Perhaps\nI'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\nTill the roof comes off, till the lights go out\nTill my legs give out, can\u2019t shut my mouth\nTill the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps\nI'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\n\n[Verse 2: Dahlak Brathwaite]\nSince I was little I\u2019ve been fiddling with the riddle\nFocus like folks addicted to Ritalin craftin' it with no chisel\nYou soft as Malcolm in the Middle\nI\u2019m strong as the Nation of Islam with Malcolm in the Middle\nUh Izza, Uh Izza, can you save them\nPlayful like skittles or that little minstrel delicious was kissing like a switch\nSwitch it up like a schizo\nPretty motherfucker would get ugly like Gizmo\nIt\u2019s okay maybe it\u2019s not your day\nI\u2019m a winner couldn\u2019t even get beat by Dr. Dre\nI couldn\u2019t even get beat if I was your slave (Yay)\nI got [?]\nMy designer clothes look like [?]\nAngry like sin case thoughts once his chains unlocked\nAnd this is why I\u2019m hot\nBut not in that M.I.M.S sort of way\nMore like you better get him sort of way\nCause until I kill Bill he won\u2019t put his sword away\nBeen a professor like you got your tenure today\nGot my vendetta to settle I ain\u2019t settlin' for close\nWhen it comes to wantin' change I\u2019m as unsettled as Mos\nSpittin' live from the boondocks\nWith my boombox\nSittin' on my soap box\nSpittin' got my folks locked\nThey patiently waiting for me to give em' some of freedom fighter\nKind like Huey Freeman of 21\n\n[Chorus]\nTill the roof comes off, till the lights go out\nTill my legs give out, can\u2019t shut my mouth\nTill the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps\nI'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\nTill the roof comes off, till the lights go out\nTill my legs give out, can\u2019t shut my mouth\nTill the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps\nI'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\n\n[Verse 3: Watsky]\nI don't need a chart to see that I look hard to me\nThere's no Chardonay pumping through my arteries\nAnd my heart\u2019ll say I should take the harder way\nIf I got a part to play, I won\u2019t make it Bartleby\nAt least this Starter T is feeling like an armor piece\nIt's guarding me like it\u2019s righteous artistry\nSo far to lead us to inagaddadavida\nTo seeking god in your freedom\nTo God I gotta lead a vida bonita\nCause see to lead a beautiful life\nIs more than eating, sleeping, and meeting suitable wife\nYou gotta fight\nWhile luda\u2019s throwing bows in A-town\nI\u2019ll be throwing blows like little children on the playground\nYou should know the bay, we're seeming sorta tame\nBut we can go insane\nAnd if you\u2019re on lower plane like when a boeing lands\nMy fist detaches at the wrist, so I\u2019ll be throwing hands\n\n[Chorus]\nTill the roof comes off, till the lights go out\nTill my legs give out, can\u2019t shut my mouth\nTill the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps\nI'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\nTill the roof comes off, till the lights go out\nTill my legs give out, can\u2019t shut my mouth\nTill the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps\nI'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3433966a73a598eca7e6120b7f0cbab3.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Guilty Pleasures", "title": "Fight! Fight!
