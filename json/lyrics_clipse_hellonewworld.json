This is ya man Grimey from downtown Norfolk. Just want y'all to know it's about time for us to come up and make a change, man. They keep tryin' to keep us down, but that ain't the way to be, man. It's about time for us to get it together, man. Ery'body else put they shit together. Why the niggas can't get together, put they money together? Hustlers come together with hustlers, know what I'm saying? This ain't just for the playas in VA. This for playas all over the world. This is Grimey\n\n[Verse 3: Pusha T]\nTimes-a-wasting, niggas doin so much hatin\nFree ya heart, and show ya greatness\nI, like you, had to come from up under the basement\nJust like you, had Satan tryin my patience\nStill you look at me through jealous eyes\nI wish to see all my niggas rise up! Get that money\nPut them 9s up, piggy-back out the ghetto \u2018for times up!\nNiggas rush!\n\n[Hook: Pharrell]\nHello new world, here we come on them Twinkie trains\nWith the hood screaming, \"We on our way\"\nCan't forget where I come from\nSo I extend my hand to my man, screaming, \"I'm on my way!\"\nYes, I rap, but best believe, them things still get wrapped\nBy Papi, screaming, \"It's on its way!\"\nI can't wait for the next nigga from my hood to say\n\"Look out world, I'm on my way\""}], "artist": "Clipse"}
