We can make a lot of money\nBuy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly\nI was yea high and muddy\nLookin' for what was lookin' for me\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I don't need to lie no more\nNowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and\nShe don't cry no more\nShe tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...\nI ain't askin' \"Why?\" no more\nOh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines\nIt ain't 2009 no more\nYeah, I know what's behind that door\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, they ask me what I'm smilin' for\nWell, because I've never been this high before\nIt's like I never felt alive before\nMhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind than war\nSee me and you, we ain't that different\nI struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'\nTake my time to finish, mind my business\nA life ain't a life 'til you live it, I was diggin' me a hole\nBig enough to bury my soul\nWeight of the world, I gotta carry my own\nMy own, with these arms I can carry you home\nI'm right here when you scared and alone, and I ain't never in a hurry\nYou don't ever gotta worry\nEven when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low\nWhen your heart get cold\nSee what's behind all them unturned stones\nAnd I'm a pro when it come to my job\nBut really I'm just tryna start believin' in God\nNow when it gets hard\nI don't panic, I don't sound the alarm\n\n[Chorus]\nBecause I don't need to lie no more\nNowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and\nShe don't cry no more\nShe tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...\nI ain't askin' \"Why?\" no more\nOh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines\nIt ain't 2009 no more\nYeah, I know what's behind that door\nI don't need to lie no more\nNowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and\nShe don't cry no more\nShe tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...\nI ain't askin' \"Why?\" no more\nOh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines\nIt ain't 2009 no more\nYeah, I know what's behind that door", "year": "2018-08-03", "album": "Swimming", "title": "2009"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
