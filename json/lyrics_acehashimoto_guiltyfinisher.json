Definitely\nHollering \u201cA Bay Bay\u201d like the Chesapeake\nI try to not to let the speakers speak\n\u2018Cause my actions so loud\nI know these other guys act foul\nBut try not to trip \u2018cause when I put in the script how they gonna act now\nWow, feel bad dropping this line\nNervous, you got me going out of my mind\nTelling you about the guys that have waste your time\nIf you wanna go [?] like Optimus Prime\nWell, I\u2019ll be your beast if you want to be my beauty\nI know I\u2019m far from the saint-like [?]\nBut I just want to be your man\nI\u2019ll kiss you on the brain in the shadow of the train\nOver the light of the full blue moon\nAnytime you leave, it\u2019s too soon\nI can\u2019t think of nothing better that me and you together\nOh, you too?\n\n[Hook: Yah Sed]\nRound and round and round we go\nIt\u2019s hard to tell us, carousel is\nSpinning high, fast and slow\nWhen no one\u2019s waiting while it\u2019s spinning round\n\n[Verse 2: Aris P!]\nCan\u2019t wait the moment of words will only take a second\nI know I\u2019m sad, least still blessed by your presence\nJust by your essence, you put me in a trance\nBe glad when God bless me to put me in your plans\nMan, your voice is my favorite song when I hear it\nIn fact, the [?] in my tongue is a lyric\nI\u2019m obsessed with the spirit, trying to see the blame\nWhy you don\u2019t know this? Even science can\u2019t explain\nHow I feel, I would love to carry you away\nToo afraid to talk, for the fear of scaring you away\nSo, I think about, \u201cwhat should I say now?\u201d\n[?] situation just to play out\nI keep telling myself, \u201csome other time\u201d\nBut hate seeing you walk away with some other guy\nSo, if I want to begin to finalize, then\nI got to make a move to stop this fantasizing\n\n[Hook: Yah Sed]\nRound and round and round we go\nIt\u2019s hard to tell us, carousel is\nSpinning high, fast and slow\nWhen no one\u2019s waiting while it\u2019s spinning round", "year": "2008-08-26", "album": "Volume: One!
