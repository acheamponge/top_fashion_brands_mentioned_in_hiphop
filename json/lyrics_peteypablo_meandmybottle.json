Thunderbird with grape kool-aid inside it\nFolks knew about it\nFuck it, I ain't hiding\nNo more ass whoopings\nCause I ain't finnen' to wild out\nI ain't really wild out, until Friday\nCause Friday, and that's when folks got they checks\nAnd they checks was getting cashed\nWe was right there\nTo catch that, snatch that\nAfter folks cashed they checks\nYeah, I know we shouldn't done that\nI was a kid\nAnd kid did, what kid did\nI wasn't no different\nThan other folks kids\nI wasn't the only one that did it, shit\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]\nI drive better after I been sipping\nUse all my signals\nEspecially if the police sitting\nI be cautious than a son a bitch\nSeat belt clicking\nBoth hands on the steering wheel\nSo serious\nNo swerving, no hitting the curb\nDon't wanna talk, my radio going in there\nI'm sitting straight up like a nerd\nDestination ????\nThis stop sign ever turn orange\nI been sitting here for an hour and it still ain't turned\nBut I dare not run it cause it's ?\nAin't got but one more point and my license\nAnd my license is going, going, gone\nSat there so long, I done sobered up some\nAnd I'm feeling real dumb\nCause I realized what I'd done\nSitting at a sign and waiting for it to turn\nSo I take me a sip\nAnd keep on going\n\n[Hook]", "year": null}]}
