Self-explanatory\nTake it back to Timexes and Outies\nPushing through 1-39th, seeing Spanish, Jesus and Ralphie\nYou know when we came we was holding\nBesides bread, it was lead\nGo head, search us, guns is by the shoulders\nWe countin' every one in the back of the store\nDifferent whores will jump out, different walls smelling like cum\nNowadays niggas know hustling\nYeah, go head, tell it wrong and get jinxed by the FBI\nWord to every kingpin's wish\nMove humble and hard, play the right men, slay the right bitch\nThrough the mix of concurrent drama\nWe honor niggas that died, got trapped up and fell behind karma\nThis real nigga lecture his destiny\nPlay the perfect hand of perfection, everything's a blessing at heart\nI sat back like the giant from start, play number two position learn\nTo listen, gamble insmarts\nNow we pushing from town to town\nRealizing credit's the shit, but can't trust no niggas around\nI try to establish life on my own, blaze a hundred bones\nAnd think, I'm painting by the second, it's on\nYo, call the flag of a Muslim son, who base his life on guns and murder\nFree business, handling chumps\nNow alot of niggas is gone, sleeping on the Rican on the catwalk\nHawk on his leg, back on his own\nA wise man set up for failure\n\n[Interlude: Raekwon]\nYo, yo, yo, untie him man\n\n[Hook 2X]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/99ff63951f21bd5532d81bd64d3cbd69.800x800x1.jpg", "album": "ILL Bill Is The Future Vol. II", "year": "2006-10-13"}]}
