I just want to make music\nMy only passion, why is it so hard to understand this?\nThis is what I'm doing, this is who I am\nComposing music until the day I am\nOne hundred and ten years old, matter of fact, with a ten-year-old\nThat grew up and had his own ten-year-old\nUntil I got tens of thousands of euros that I can give to charity and fluoros\nAs much as I can, I hope that you know\nMy soul and my passion is so true\nIt may be me and it's not so you\nSo don't give your opinion if I ain't ask for it\nI just want to do my thing, not get cash for it\nThey can pay me, but it's only going back to the people who need it\nThe people who breathe in this music who can't live without it\nIt's like carbon dioxide and oxygen, CO2, I can get\nWhatever I need, so whatever I bleed\nIs whatever you can take with you the day that I leave this earth\nThis body is worthless\nWhen I get to Heaven, that's when I'll be perfect\nAnd that's certain, my purpose is to\nLift up the lovers from the ground\nWhen all the fighters come around\nLike a hero, I can save you\nSo, what's happening, little boy?\nWhat you saying?\n\n[Outro: brandUn DeShay]\nYou want you a car?\nYou want you the girls?\nYou want you the money?\nYou want you the world?\nWell, good luck\nBe blessed\nI'm blessed", "year": "2009-02-23", "album": "Volume: Two!
