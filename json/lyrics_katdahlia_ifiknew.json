Silent sorrow?\nIf you would just acknoledge how I feel\nThen we could re-negotiate the deal\nBut you got up and you cleared the closets\nNever thought you'd go and leave\nI guess you were one to try and fix this as bad as me, ay ay\n\n[Chorus]\nBut If I knew you'd make it so hard\nI would've never ever begged you to stay\nYeah If  I knew you'd make it so hard\nI would've never begged you to stay ay ay\nI woulda never ever begged you to stay, yeah ay ay ay ay ay\n\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh my girl, she wanna lie to me\nOh my girl, she made us a tragedy\nOh my girl, she's tryna run away\nOh my girl, like a fool I been broke ever since you went away ay ay\n\n[Chorus]\nBut If I knew you'd make it so hard\nI would've never ever begged you to stay\nYeah If  I knew you'd make it so hard\nI would've never begged you to stay ay ay\nI woulda never ever begged you to stay, yeah ay ay ay ay ay"}], "artist": "Kat Dahlia"}
