'cause she don't want no drama\nI'd rather take your ass to the Bahamas\nThan give you thirty thousand a month like Diddy, baby momma\n\n[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]\nI know you're sick and tired of waitin' on me girl\nBut I'm just tryin' to get my money right\nSo unless I'm done we could take a flight\nSo I can take you all around the world\nPlanes, trains, automobiles\nBentley or a Range, chromed out wheels\nFirst class ticket, G-4, you that deal\nFor real (I can take you all around the world)\n\n[Verse 2: Game]\nPicture me thuggin'\nPicture me lovin' you like Bobby love Whitney\nNow picture me fuckin'\nPullin' your ponytail, smackin' you on the ass\nTellin' you how (I can take you all around the world)\nThat nigga can't do it like this\nEven Beyonc\u00e9 couldn't move it like this\nShe only fuck with soldiers, that's her shit\nI hate to admit it but I love my bitch so much\nI'm sittin' outside in the Benz\nThinkin' back to Dre's house when I fucked her best friend\nThe pussy wasn't nothin'\nNow I'm dealin' with the diary of a mad black woman with Louis Vuitton luggage\nShe told me she was tired of the Game and rap\nQuit like Ma$e then she came right back\nI told you the bitch sex was whack\nAnd you're all I need, even Jamie know that\n\n[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]\nI know you're sick and tired of waitin' on me girl\nBut I'm just tryin' to get my money right\nSo unless I'm done we could take a flight\nSo I can take you all around the world\nPlanes, trains, automobiles\nBentley or a Range, chromed out wheels\nFirst class ticket, G-4, you that deal\nFor real (I can take you all around the world)\n\n[Verse 3: Game]\nYou know what they say, \"more money, more problems, more drama\"\nMeans more marijuana and less baby momma\nYou know I love you like I love my shoes\nBut even white Air Force ones come in two's\nYeah, I like her and I like you too\nWhat's wrong? She my bitch and you my boo\nShe got a Range Rover Sport, you got a Bentley coupe\nShe take my clothes to the cleaners, you take Harlem to school\nI gave you the Birkin bags so I made a mistake\nAnd Oprah don't fuck with them no more anyway\nI'm sorry for the bullshit I put you through\nBut I ain't goin' nowhere, I got a kid wit'chu\nWhy we always gotta argue about Superhead's book\nShe sucked my dick with a condom on, after that I shook\nAnd when she start talking about buying a ring\nI just turn the volume up and let Jamie Foxx sing\n\n[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]\nI know you're sick and tired of waitin' on me girl\nBut I'm just tryin' to get my money right\nSo unless I'm done we could take a flight\nSo I can take you all around the world\nPlanes, trains, automobiles\nBentley or a Range, chromed out wheels\nFirst class ticket, G-4, you that deal\nFor real (I can take you all around the world)"}]}
