I'm getting stacks in\nOn the frozen throne, I might just catch it\nAngels falling in my soul, money stacking, Gucci cologne\nGot cash, got bags, my bros\nMany men wanna kill me, I don't know\nWhy they trying to get me? I just blow\nMoney and coke up in my nose\nPercs in my system, I'm never slow\nGolden noise running round the floor\nI sit down in the frozen throne\nShe called me up and called me on the phone\nShe fucked me over once, someone that I know\nI be getting dough\nSoldiers from white snow\nMoola in my rover\nWith Adamn killing my soul\nFuck with Lean, I break your bones\nFuck with Lean, I break your bones\nMoola in my rover", "title": "Cashin"}]}
