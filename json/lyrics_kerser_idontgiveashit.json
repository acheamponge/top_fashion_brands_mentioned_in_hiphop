You'll be mute like plucka\nGet ready for Kerser and Sarm\nYou merk from above, straight merkin' the young\nGet hurt in the bum, 'cause you're thirsty for cum\nTo me, you don't exist like sers in a run\nSee that, never cause a commotion\nLike a black bear, forced in the ocean\nI'm a tag rare, forced in the moment\nYou're a black queer, snorting the lotion\nYou get kicked, hit, thrown aside\nWhen we spit shit, stonerfied\nYou get ripped bitch, open wide\nFor a quick kid, motorbike\nDon't ever try step to the best\nGet left in a mess like feds in a dress\nFaggots! We'll leave you stressed and depressed\nKerser and Sarm the best meds to ingest\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't give a shit what you do on a track\nKerser and Sarm make you move right back\nI don't give a fuck if you think you're the best\nWhat we're spittin' caving in your whole chest\nI don't give a shit what you do on a track\nKerser and Sarm make you move right back\nI don't give a fuck if you think you're the best\nWhat we're spittin' caving in your whole chest\n\n[Verse 2: Kerser]\nI don't give a shit what you do on a track\n'Cause you're doin' an act, why you doin' it, lad?\nIt seems so sad and lame to me\nThat I wait eight hours patiently\nSe-se-settin' up a bomb right under the deck\nThen you hit the stage; no set\nCunts in your back row equals your front row\nOnly got one row, now they're all fucked bro\nFucked up and they're leaving with burns\nLeaving the Earth, how evil is Kers?\nHalf these cunts never been on the street\nBut they speak like they be on the beat with the heat\nWhy you wanna talk about shit that you never done?\nSay you pullin' triggers but you couldn't even get a gun\nGet 'em son, yeah, you emptied a full clip?\nNo you didn't. Never have, don't bullshit\nKers one, you can mark my words\nI'll make you fuckin' listen when I start a verse\nY-y-your shit's whack, it's piss weak to me\nI could probably get you killed for a fifty of weed\nAnd I listen to the shit that you say\nI can tell that you tryna be fifty today\nBut Kers and Sarm, yeah Sarm and Kers\nTurn your shy missus to an arse [?]\nSlut\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't give a shit what you do on a track\nKerser and Sarm make you move right back\nI don't give a fuck if you think you're the best\nWhat we're spittin' caving in your whole chest\nI don't give a shit what you do on a track\nKerser and Sarm make you move right back\nI don't give a fuck if you think you're the best\nWhat we're spittin' caving in your whole ch-\nI don't give a shit what you do on a track\nKerser and Sarm make you move right back\nI don't give a fuck if you think you're the best\nWhat we're spittin' caving in your whole chest\nI don't give a shit what you do on a track\nKerser and Sarm make you move right back\nI don't give a fuck if you think you're the best\nWhat we're spittin' caving in your whole ch-"}], "artist": "Kerser"}
