Guess who come to pay a visit?\nIt's the Mr. Walking Blizzard, with the \"here lizard, lizard\"\nFlyer than a flock of pigeons, the earlobes are vivid\nBut if you try to test, you'll get smoked like a brisket\nLast palace, fast livin, Family Guy like Peter Griffin\nAnd my wallet is stuffed like turkeys at Thanksgiving\nI grind hard, my pockets full like Easter Mass\nPaper long, my money stretchin like yoga class\n\"Get Money\", yeah that's my task, I'm throwed like a piece of trash\nMy wrists light up like camera flash while commentators live in the past\nBut me and Koopa back on our mash from Antoine to Ledbetter\nGot more paper than a mail shredder, cause 'round here we go getters\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]\nChamillitary mayne, who knowin just how I do, so it's time to turn up your tuner\nWith radio play or not, they talk about me like a rumor (rumor)\nAnd they hope my album will leak on the streets and come sooner (sooner)\nI now renounce my throne as the King of Zamunda\nHollywood, not true, been sick, ah-choo\nThe inventors of the \"what it do,\" where the Don Kings of the candy blue\nWe don't really mean to brag but we legends so act like you knew\nThat we one notch below Pimp and Screw but we (way higher than you)\nI'm skatin, no Daytons, with Paul Wall to plate and (plate and)\nYa must've got us mistaken cause ain't no play-action fakin (fakin)\nEarthquakin, trunk shakin (shakin), the realest in my state and (say what?)\nThe treat me like I'm God, they be like As-Salamu Alaykum, so vacant\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3 - Paul Wall]\n'Round here the grind pays, it's all work and no play\nMy pockets thick like Deltas and my Sprite's pink like AKA's\nBrace yourself, you'll be amazed, all haters can suck on these\nMe and Cham back in the game, I'm Reggie Bush, he's Drew Brees\nI run the mic and he's so thoed, now all the blogs are quite pleased\nCause they thought we fell off like dry scalp and bad weave\n\"Get Ya Mind Correct\" please, my wrist cold like winter breeze\nCause I'm grindin up all night like little kids on Christmas Eve\nI keep the stacks on deck like a lawn chair\nThe wristware give off a glare, so when ya stare, do so with care\n'Round here we one hundred but them boys far from it\nEveryday I'm in the paper like the comics, how we do it 'round here\n\n[Hook]\n\n(Beanz N Kornbread)", "year": null}]}
