Break the walls down\nY'all don't want none, break the walls down\n\n[Verse 1]\nAiyyo.. yeah, yo..\nAiyyo I break down walls, take down walls\nSwing baseball bats at you, I hate y'all\nIf they brawl, we brawl, bring the heat y'all\nBite they face off, I'mma eat y'all, defeat y'all\nI'm a wild man, heavy metal hardrocker\nDeath before dishonor, I gotcha, Rugged Man drop ya\nAin't no peace here, there's beef here\nThere ain't no man that we fear, you got beef? We be here\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe most violent, unstoppable, crazy, crusty\nUgly, my mother doesn't trust me\nI walk with a sickness, slash you, break you\nTake you, throw you on the floor, duct tape you\nI'm a monster, bone-crusher, dome-splitter\nWe throw witcha, you roll thick we roll thicker\nHuman Rottweiler, rip your ribcage out\nWe flip out, let the rage out, we insane now\nThe headbanger, body banger, body breaker\nRhyme wrecker, manslaughter manslayer\nStep into the darkness, we sneak through, if we see you\nWe gon' beat you, this is what we do, we do\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Bridge]\nNow who wan' try to take us? (Right now)\nNow who wan' get beat down? (Right now)\nNow who wanna step outside?
