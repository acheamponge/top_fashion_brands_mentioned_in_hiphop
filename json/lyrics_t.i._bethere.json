the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there\nAnd when you tryna find forever and you lookin' in the clouds, I'ma be there\nAnd when they say that all hope is gone and all lost is lost, yeah\nAnd when you look up in the stars, hopin' I can fly where you are, I'ma be there\nAnd when the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there\nAnd when you tryna find forever and you look up in the clouds, I'ma be there\nAnd when it's all said and done and ain't no one else to call, no\nAnd when you look around it was you that did it all\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nIf it all fall down, when the smoke clear look around\nBetcha see me standin' on a pile\nIf it all go to hell, I'ma fire a blunt up in the air\nSave some for my partners if they there\nI declare, I ain't a shoe-in to get in Heaven\nBut I can make it if God in a good mood, bein' fair\nAllow me to prepare 'cause I know that death comin'\nThey can make excuses, they be runnin' from truth\nIt make they stomach hurt\nFurther more, a nigga don't want a revolution\nThese niggas wanna ride a 'vert, nigga wanna spit a verse\nAnd then write about things they didn't do\nSee I ain't never did that shit to you\nBeen a hundred from the start, look\nWe just a monumental, legendary shit, glad I was a part of it\nSo even if we part ways, we'll always have the good days\nAnd they gon' always be there, yeah\n\n[Chorus: London Jae]\nWhen the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there\nAnd when you tryna find forever and you lookin' in the clouds, I'ma be there\nAnd when they say that all hope is gone and all lost is lost, yeah\nAnd when you look up in the stars, hopin' I can fly where you are, I'ma be there\nAnd when the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there\nAnd when you tryna find forever and you look up in the clouds, I'ma be there\nAnd when it's all said and done and ain't no one else to call, no\nAnd when you look around it was you that did it all\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nHey, when your back against the wall, you think all lost\nI'm in your mind helpin' you examine all thoughts\nFuck what them niggas talk about, just talkin'\nThat's just their way of sayin' that they don't see me that often\nI be here for ya, when them niggas get too weird for ya\nThat shit they make don't feel real to ya\nSee me every year they like, \"Damn, he been around for a long time\"\nBut it better when he here, we know he definitely real\nAnd that should be the deal breaker\nI outta call these niggas soft, shakin'\nThey be droppin' salt on a player like they killin' a snail\nFew years ago they better get me, that shit still in the air\nBitch, I'ma be here, huh\nI drop shit when I feel like it\nLong as I know that I came from real with all my real niggas and they still with me, I'm cool\nUntil you get what you supposed to, I'ma keep the champagne cold for the toast\nI'ma be here\n\n[Chorus: London Jae]\nWhen the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there\nAnd when you tryna find forever and you lookin' in the clouds, I'ma be there\nAnd when they say that all hope is gone and all lost is lost, yeah\nAnd when you look up in the stars, hopin' I can fly where you are, I'ma be there\nAnd when the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there\nAnd when you tryna find forever and you look up in the clouds, I'ma be there\nAnd when it's all said and done and ain't no one else to call, no\nAnd when you look around it was you that did it all\n\nWhen the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there\nAnd when you tryna find forever and you lookin' in the clouds, I'ma be there\nAnd when they say that all hope is gone and all lost is lost, yeah\nAnd when you look up in the stars, hopin' I can fly where you are, I'ma be there\nAnd when the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there\nAnd when you tryna find forever and you look up in the clouds, I'ma be there\nAnd when it's all said and done and ain't no one else to call, no\nAnd when you look around it was you that did it all\n\nWhen the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there\nAnd when you tryna find forever and you lookin' in the clouds, I'ma be there\nAnd when they say that all hope is gone and all lost is lost, yeah\nAnd when you look up in the stars, hopin' I can fly where you are, I'ma be there\nAnd when the sun goes down and ain't nobody around, I'ma be there\nAnd when you tryna find forever and you look up in the clouds, I'ma be there\nAnd when it's all said and done and ain't no one else to call, no\nAnd when you look around it was you that did it all\n\n[Outro: T.I.]\nYou know what they say\nWhat the Devil mean for bad, God use it for good, right?\nWell, I'm sure the people who put crack cocaine in our communities infested us with all this hate, all these guns, all this violence, all this rage\nYou see they never counted on us takin' those very experiences, packaging them as philosophical presentations set to music about the experiences\nAnd how many people would relate to it and how much commerce would come from it\nYeah, they didn't count on that\nHeh, that they dumb ass\nIt's trap music"}], "artist": "T.I."}
