Can you eat it 'fore you beat it? (Nah, chill)\nBitch, you gotta pay before I spray (That's real)\nBut I can never knock the next man\nWho gon' trick on them hoes until he got a bed pan\nBut see me, I can't, and I won't, get fucked\nYou ain't got it, then you can't, and you won't, get tugged\nSee me I'm steppin' in fly\nAnd I can show you a whole lotta shit; open your eyes\n\n[Interlude]\nPlaya playa playa, play on, ah\nPlaya playa playa, play on, ah\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd naw, not the nigga that'll make you change your name\nBut you'll never want another 'cause the game, it flow through my veins\nAnd naw, not the nigga that'll make you change your name\nBut you'll never want another 'cause the game, it flow through my veins\n\n[Outro]\nYou know I'll be around", "album": "IVRY", "title": "Thru My Veins", "image": "https://images.genius.com/de489522831aef11a8d71bbadeebdfd7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "100s"}
