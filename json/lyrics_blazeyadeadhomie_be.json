Here they come\nSomeone\u2019s coming, here they come x3\nShould I start running? Here they come\nOoh, false alarm\n\n[Verse 3]\nContinue loading goods out the back of the crib\nTo the truck of the car, I can barely close the lid\nNow I\u2019m back in the house, take the picture off the fireplace\nGrabbed a crowbar, and I crack open the safe\nSnatch the money and the jewelry\nThis ain\u2019t nothing new to me\nThen I see the lights through the window\nAnd I freeze, hear the keys\nI flee, I speed up the street\nIf I\u2019m caught, doing 5 to 10 stretch like a dream\nMy B&E\n\n[Hook x2]\n\nLoad it all in my sack"}], "artist": "Blaze Ya Dead Homie"}
