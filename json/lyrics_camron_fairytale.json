You rude!\"\nNah, I'm Eric Wright, [nigga] with a attitude\nThen I hit her with some 'Pac -- \"I ain't mad at you\"\nY'all stay shook, I'm straight crook\nI made appointment for head, that face book\nAnd I stay in drama, but anything with honor\nI hit your BBM -- your broke baby momma\nAnd I won't stop, I'm on my Diddy [shit]\nYeah, they start to like me, then they find out I'm a idiot\nAll they do is look and say, \"Mmm-mmm, pretty slick\"\nAnd your girl is like my knot -- pretty thick\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nShout to my black president, Obama\nTell the cops chill, though; find Osama\nSecret Service, sorry -- I don't want no drama\nYou'll be enemy of the state; whoa, mama!\nGucci boots with the strap, all brown, though\nYou're worthless, same circus -- different clowns, though\nMy scoundrels on Greyhounds with pounds, though\nWe take trips with bricks -- hey, you down, ho?\nDon't question me, play enough clown, yo\nI get the whistle cause you're way out of bounds, mo\nWe fly high, fly guys, aideo!\nY'all burgers like Five Guys, adios\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYoung girls say I'm fly, cute -- I reply mute\nF5 coupe I pull up to my stoop\nKissing in public? That's preposterous\nSuperman? Nah, but the crip is Metropolis\nMy day? It consists of driving bricks\nPicking money up, getting head, copping kicks\nThen the studio -- I don't even stop and piss\n\"Go shopping now, Cam?\" -- c'mon, stop it, miss\n\n[Hook]"}]}
