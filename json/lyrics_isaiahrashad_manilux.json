It's mine\"\nTo them niggas that you sometimes share with, it's fine\nThat you think these eyes that I keep on staring with, it's blind\nYeah, I told you that I did not care bitch, I'm lying\n\n[Hook]\nYou made me fall in love for a minute\nYou made me fall in love for a minute\nYou made me fall in love for a minute\nYou made me fall in love for a minute\n\n[Bridge]\nLove ain't always so demanding, sometimes it's just you\n& we live life on different planets, but that ain't no excuse\n& what we got is so withstanding, but sometimes we get bruised\nAnd when the world don't understand me, I always got you\n\n[Hook]\nYou made me fall in love for a minute\nYou made me fall in love for a minute\nYou made me fall in love for a minute\nYou made me fall in love for a minute", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c7cea3b4e8e2ba385a1b2d5258952e1b.630x630x1.jpg", "album": "Welcome to the Game", "year": "2012-12-13"}]}
