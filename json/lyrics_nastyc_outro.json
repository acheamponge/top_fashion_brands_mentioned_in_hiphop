You know cause track after track it's just me talking about me or the things that I've been through in every light in every and every side cause you know there is two, the best I can\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm running laps with a machete, I poach niggas\nThat's the only way I know how to approach niggas\nEverybody's talking about beef, it won't finish\nBut I know better than to stick my nose in folk's business\nI met a white girl that told me she's obsessed with my voice\nAnd that it took a lot to say it cause she ate her pride first\nHow stupid she felt for saying she won't date a Skwati boy\nIt's crazy how far we came off of dating 5 hoes\nThey know we bad, and in Ntwana I made moves\nCheap talkers cheap but it doesn't pay dues\nSo we break bread then records then break rules\nGetting f**ked up, 50 shades of Grey Goose\nThe weed made me get trippy, the liquor makes for the stories\nThe music made me get itchy, the p**sy erase my worries\nThe money made me get greedy then everything just got blurry\nGot selfish, maybe got needy, It all just came in a hurry\nBut I understand I'm disposable\nAny dummy can claim he a rapper but I am quotable\nThink about it, I'm right where I am because the fans voted me\nSo tell me why I shouldn't kill you to get what you owe to me?\n\n[Nasty C talking]\nI think, I think I worked hard enough to... you know, say that I'm proud of myself and you're going to be proud when you hear it too. Be it either you're a one day fan or a day one fan"}], "artist": "Nasty C"}
