Fuck that\nI conquered this realm and transcend till I am ghost above rap\nMy agenda higher, more men required\nNever surrender, sire the engine within desires, the most\nHoe, make a toast, well you made it this close\nStill attacking on your toes, gold soul Indigos\n\n[Verse 4: Capital STEEZ]\nI doubted I could change this planet\nBut we all gotta take the advantage\nI started growing, it made me start embracing the damage\nThat was dealt cause I thought it was the way that we planned it\nIt made me more philosophical, we living in madness\nBut they only see the world through surveillance cameras\nWe starving and they take no precaution\nAnd apparently, the hood make us think like orphans\nAnd they treat the peace keepers like Martians\nIt's my territory, do your best to keep off it\nForfeit cause your loss is remorseless\nHomie got smoked, now he lying in a coffin"}]}
