This track ready to splash Billboard\nIt's a fact: I'm what y'all was waiting for\nI'm plat', but still hardcore\nIt's a wrap.  If you\u2019re wack, don't spit no more\nIt's a wrap.  My hot tracks\u2019ll bring it to y'all\nCome on, scream \u2018til your throat is sore\nGet off the wall, rush the dance floor\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nI'm the urban legend in true form with a goose on\nHottest artist alive.  No jive, you lukewarm\nTalk like walk\u2014with a suit on.  Stalk like\nHawks\u2014my thoughts swoop and move on.  Glide like\nClyde, crazy like Ali's nemesis.  Ecko\nTight, write\u2014my pen proves Unlimited.  Plot\nLike my penmanship hit the curb\u2014flip the words like\nAikido.  I got this in a wrap like fajita\nMake my voice span, Pan like Peter\nIn el barrio, spitting bars like, \"\u00a1Mira!\"\nSplit your cap like baseball pitchers.  I'm sick\nOf rap!  In fact, I hate y'all niggas\n'88 hip hop like, \"Kill a \u2018Sucker M.C.\u2019\"\nWhen he fake like a Pulitzer me, it's a wrap.  Lines\nLike these smash your embassy hard.  If it's\nA game, I'm snatching your memory card\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nIt's a wrap when I attack, crash the door\nIt's a wrap.  This track ready to splash Billboard\nIt's a fact: I'm what y'all was waiting for\nI'm plat', but still hardcore\nIt's a wrap.  If you\u2019re wack, don't spit no more\nIt's a wrap.  My hot tracks\u2019ll bring it to y'all\nCome on, scream \u2018til your throat is sore\nGet off the wall, rush the dance floor\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nWhen it's a wrap, y'all cats get buried alive\nFor years like the careers of the Jackson 5\nThe Sun Cycle spits heat like gun rifles\nYou ain't ready to score like a young Michael\nMy rebuttal to your waste of space is a NASA\nShuttle fate.  Me and the stars correlate\nWhere only the core relate.  In other words\nI'm the asteroid belt to your waste/waist of space\nWhen I rock the house like avalanches in your crib\nAnd write/right hook like boxers aiming for rib\nThere\u2019s a war going on\u2014I'm training the kids\nLike Markie, I stay connected to my Biz\nKRS rep the Bronx, Shane still repping The Bridge\nKane's still the god.  Like Rakim, my lesson to give:\nC-Rayz, the brand new weapon it is.  Fact:\nI'm \"Paid in Full.\u201d  You \u201cHalf-Steppin'\u201d again\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nIt's a wrap when I attack, crash the door\nIt's a wrap.  This track ready to splash Billboard\nIt's a fact: I'm what y'all was waiting for\nI'm plat', but still hardcore\nIt's a wrap.  If you\u2019re wack, don't spit no more\nIt's a wrap.  My hot tracks\u2019ll bring it to y'all\nCome on, scream \u2018til your throat is sore\nGet off the wall, rush the dance floor\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nThis is\nMiami Vice rap\u2014diamond bunion.  Jacking\nYour face, making you cry\u2014praise the onion\nSixteen bars should get you drunk thirty-two times\nThen you find I double up when I write rhymes\nI might battle, then war like White Shadows\nIn the \"Eye of the Tiger,\u201d who want to fight Drago?\nOn Rocky roads, I hike gravel.  The Sun Cycle\nMic unravels and light travels.  Life is\nThe Playoffs\u2014anything can happen but\nYou\u2019re sure to lose your spot if you\u2019re slacking, cuz\nYou lose all your profit from copping jewels.  So\nStuck-up, your shit could be used for rocket fuel.  I got\nTalent, but that's apparent.  The way I give\nBirth to hits, I should be a parent\nI'll kill you at the end of the game like, \"Good try\nBut you are the weakest link. Goodbye!\"\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz]\nIt's a wrap when I attack, crash the door\nIt's a wrap.  This track ready to splash Billboard\nIt's a fact: I'm what y'all was waiting for\nI'm plat', but still hardcore\nIt's a wrap.  If you\u2019re wack, don't spit no more\nIt's a wrap.  My hot tracks\u2019ll bring it to y'all\nCome on, scream \u2018til your throat is sore\nGet off the wall, rush the dance floor\n\n[Outro (Hook Ad-Libs): C-Rayz Walz]"}]}
