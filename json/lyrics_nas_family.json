Havoc]\nYo..\nDunn you fam to me, and only family\nThat can get that close to me, keep it type strong\nBlowing green that's keeping us going\nIsland hopping getting right on them 747 Boeings\nDunn you fam to me, and only family\nThat can get that close to me, keep it type strong\nBlowing green that's keeping us going\nUnconditional love showing\nYo, yo, yo, yo\n40th side, 41st side ride\n\n[Verse 1: Prodigy]\nMe and my Dunns come from the slums\nYou can't take the slums out my Dunns\nAnd that's how it is, that's how we live\nSometimes I find myself wearing the same shit for days\nNot caring, bout what they gon' think or say\nI got that, I don't give a fuck in me, it's stuck in me\nThat's how I 'vantage over y'all niggas, y'all too pretty\nWe too gritty, like Sanford and Son\nToo grimy like Pigpen with jewels on\nSee we the top rap niggas, the Q-Dogs\nYou got a lot of nerve, putting out them songs\nKnowing that my niggas come strong, so let's get it on\nWe just getting warm, operation Quiet Storm\nSilent wars or we silence the fours\nHav, P, and Nas, got it in the smash, fo'sho\nNow it's movies and soundtracks\nThis is where your career stop at\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nAyo, I drink to that\nI'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me\nYou violate, they read your obituary in front your family\nYou should idolize Nas in the flesh\nDon't wait 'til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt\nWe shot hoops with coat hangers, got loot with dope slangers\nSold soap to strangers, joked with danger\nRob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit\nBought weight from rastas, travel hot routes\nO.T. commute back and forth\nTell shorty get that package off\nFuck being trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit\nCaught a case then I beat the shit\nD's on the block flash badges, nylon jackets\nBig white boys with guns yelling, \"Freeze black kids!\"\nGot my niggas in the pen, eating octopus\nWishing they was on the blocks with us\nTo watch me and P do it (uh), put the heat to it (uh)\nPut it out, first day, the whole street knew it\nBitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music\nAnd think deep to it, now who the truest?\n\n[Chorus: Havoc]\nYo..\nDunn you fam to me, and only family\nThat can get that close to me, keep it type strong\nBlowing green that's keeping us going\nIsland hopping getting right on them 747 Boeings\nDunn you fam to me, and only family\nThat can get that close to me, keep it type strong\nBlowing green that's keeping us going\nUnconditional love showing\nYo.. yo you fam to me, and only family\nThat can get that close to me, keep it type strong\nBlowing green that's keeping us going\nUnconditional love showing\nYo you fam to me, and only fam to me\nThat can get that close to me, keep it type strong\n\n[Verse 3: Prodigy]\nDirty fingernails, reaching in my pocket pulling knots out\nI daydream of better days, in different ways\nOut this lifestyle we live, iced-out with the big fifth\nThat's why the burnt leather lean to the left\nEven though we gained cash on fish\nI'm trapped on reason being we ain't all rich\nAnd I'ma be that same nigga for the door\nAnd I'ma still walk the same path, we soon clash\nWe get stacks, you do the math\nWe pound niggas out, walk away and laugh\nFresh from out the lab, P and Nastradamus, kid\nRap niggas shit they drawers\n\n[Verse 4: Nas]\nYo they probably did\nI aircondition y'all niggas, my prediction is you rewind this\nYour highness, Q-Boro's finest\nClick your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas\nGrant you a wish, you get rich while listening hard\nTo my thugs in the prison yard, bench-pressing 200 pounds and up\nFeeling like you down on your luck\nRaise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library\nAppeal the game, all eyes on me\nRestrained from, being looked at, it's uncivilized\nWe epitomize thug song, y'all niggas get mad\nJealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style\nNo heart and no look, shook\nGet stole on, my niggas move right in the moonlight\nY'all niggas get done, I pee on them son, they a small issue\nWe too official, blue steel pistols\nTeflon vests, it's no contest, we hit you\n\n[Chorus: Havoc]\nDunn you fam to me, and only family\nThat can get that close to me, keep it type strong\nBlowing green that's keeping us going\nUnconditional love showing\nYo, yo, yo, yo\n40th side, 41st side ride\n\n[Outro: Havoc]\nYeah, youknahmsayin'\nNot for nothing baby\nKnahmsayin' wanna give a shout out to my peoples\nYouknowhatImean, Yambo, Ill Will\nKilla Black, my brother\nIt's never gonna be another, word up..\nYeah, you know how we do dunn, word up\n\n[Skit]\nThe future is nothing but a series of probability made up of decisions that we make right now but these decisions leads to certain events into the future and every human being has a capability to determine their own future\nSome are just more into it than others..."}], "artist": "Nas"}
