Listen\nWhatever you do, don't fall asleep\nMan\nJeff, listen to me, don't go to sleep, Jeff\nLook, I'll talk to you tomorrow\nJeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, answer me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8624e4a6fdfb9b83008647b72d71bbee.371x371x1.jpg", "album": null, "title": "Nightmare on My Street"}]}
