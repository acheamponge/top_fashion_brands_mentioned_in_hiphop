{"songs": [{"lyrics": "Leave the crib\nLace my shoes everyday my nigga cause I ain't tripping on shit\n& if you can't take a bad bitch\nTurn her to a boss, best believe that your pimping ain't shit\n& that's word to my clique\nDon't send me no track, cause my nigga I ain't getting on shit\nIf it ain't for no chips\n& if you got a problem motherfucker you can suck on this dick\nBitch nigga get your money right\nRunning 'round acting like a hoe\nTryna see what another nigga money like\nCause your money tight & my pockets getting heavy\nGot a bad model bitch on the other side of the celly\nTelling me she arranged the weed in a telly\nSpark a cigarette after I'm in her belly\nMake my escape, no laying up, I'm chasing this paper\nWar going on outside no man is safe from\nBut I finish everything thats on my plate\nLike I'm working for a bakery, I'm always on a cake\n& they telling me I'm speeding & they telling me to pace\n& I tell 'em \"I ain't been told what to do since I was eight\" done\nThese niggas try & tell me what success mean\nLife's a game & I'm captain of the chess team\nBrett Favre for the pack is how I get green\nYoung rich nigga, living bitch niggas wet dreams\nSteak & lobster, yeah I'm eating like a boss do\nHigh off the chronic & I'm sauced too\nAin't talking a dollar then get lost fool\nThink you got what it takes, my nigga it'll cost you", "album": "ChRon Burgundy", "year": "2011-07-23", "title": "Menthol", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/8b20b2e431b6ff249b9a84387b2bf8d5.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Da$H"}
