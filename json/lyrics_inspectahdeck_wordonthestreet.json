They got my man, he knows shit\nBitch nigga that I rolled with told shit!\nI laid low, 007 'til it get dark\nHe told where my Wis' live and where the whip's parked\nGot my address off the license plate\nThat eliminate, headin' to my next restin' place\nUncertain, my Wis' peeped from behind the curtain\nAnd seen the high-beam from the chicky lurkin'\nThe high-speed chase got me swervin'\nI needed a diversion, crashed in the side of a Suburban\nIn the mirror, I'm starin' at the eyes of the law\nCouldn't jump out, fucked up the drivers-side door\nCalled China, \"Meet me in a half with the Pathfinder\nNo time to talk, I'll fill you in when I find ya\"\nStopped at a neighborhood diner, brought me some attire\nAnd swore to hold me down in the fire\n\n[Hook: Inspectah Deck (Raekwon)]\n(The word on the street) They can't trace my rap sheets\nStill, I creep swift, tryin' to slip all heat\n(The word on the street) This thing's way beyond deep\nPromise me you'll keep ya mouth closed with no leaks\n(What's the word on the street?) The evidence concrete\nMy Co-D mysteriously got set free\n(The word on the street) The photographs let the beast splash Through the projects the last few weeks\n\n[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]\nYo, you bein' watched like you new on the block from roof tops\nGet your moves on, these hot shots pop, music stops\nParty's over, bold soldier move for his holster\nShot the lights out, struck the bouncer in his shoulder\nHard times for Po, I can't control the masses\nScream for more, backstage, we sling V.I.P. passes\nJakes sprayin' mace, riots takin' place\nWhen the Clan show they face, the fans slow they pace\nGet your blunt rolled, fuck the Five-0, they want it, dun' know\nBitches get trampled, niggas wildin' in the front row\nFire Marshall catch a beat-down, tryin' to cut my sound\nRadio dispatcher, back-up, bustin' rounds\nWithout intermission from a crouch-position\nBullets ricocheted off the strobe-light, strikin' Christians\nMy nigga slipped in, 'nuff ammunition to bust back\nFuck that, them outta-town cats'll take the rap\nIt's war on the dance floor, quarter to 4\nBefore we peeled off, they tried to seal off the back door\nGats for the beast, high-pursuit down the side street\nShot up my getaway Jeep, crashed the front glass\nAnd blew the head-rest off the passenger seat\nI grabbed the heat, ditched the whip and then escaped on feet\nWhile the locals interrogated for names and photos\nWork for Five-0, swappin' info for doe\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/19b06abfed788ae492f578fa0afb063f.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Uncontrolled Substance", "year": "1999-10-05"}]}
