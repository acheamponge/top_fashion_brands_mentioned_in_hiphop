I confess\n\n[Hook]\nI've been really tryin' baby\nTryna hold back these feelings for so long\nAnd if you feel like I feel baby\nCome on, ohhh, come on\n\n[Verse 3: Bahamadia]\nI wanna be down like Brandy with you handy for the duration\nEngage in electric relaxation\nBuild a conversation, probe ya intellect\nPut ya manhood to the test, but not just the physical\nThe individual is what I'm after\nYa heart I wanna capture, I'm open like a space that NASA explores\nTruly do adore, every little move you make and more, my word is born\nBut I could go on and on throwin' hints\nThat I'm tha chick, you should be celebratin' life with\nSo instead I felt it best if I just\nStood and represented in the flesh that I confess\n\n[Hook]\nI've been really tryin' baby\nTryna hold back these feelings for so long\nAnd if you feel like I feel baby\nCome on, ohhh, come on\n\n[Outro]\nFrom the bottom of my heart I wanna confess to you\nLet me show you how I feel to let you know that this feeling is real\nI wanna confess to you baby, confess to you sugar", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9776e797698547de59bd441349d64df0.1000x996x1.jpg", "year": "1996-04-02", "title": "I Confess", "album": "Kollage"}]}
