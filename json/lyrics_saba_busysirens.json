Tell me, how are you sad?\nYou got all of these friends, you got all of these fans\"\nI ain't trust nobody new since 2012, I ain't let nobody in\nJesus got killed for our sins, Walter got killed for a coat\nI'm tryna cope, but it's a part of me gone\nIn this packed room I'm alone\n\n[Chorus: Saba & Daoud]\nI'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away\nI seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe\nI'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away\nI seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe\nOhhh, ohhh\n\n[Verse 2: Saba]\nI'm so alone, just me and my girl\nShe leave me for work, then leave me for school\nShe finally home, I leave her for tour\nFaceTime me nudity, yeah, all of this new to me, yeah\nAll of the infidelity when I was 17 been catchin' up\nIt still feel like she'll catch me cheatin'\nNiggas askin' me how tour was\nKnowin' I been home like two months\nAnd I seen your ass like two times\nSave the small-talk like two dimes\nNo time, social interaction\nHad female friends I found attractive\nI tried to fuck but I am no savage\nNow we don't speak, we just walk past\nIf my past could talk\nIt'd probably reply to the missed calls after all\nCause the friendships that I can't recall\nDone turned my heart into camouflage\nWhile the guys I used to play basketball with\nDoin' shit that I can't endorse now\nWith the Lord now, when it pours down\nWas alone then, still alone now\n\n[Chorus: Saba & Daoud]\nI'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away\nI seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe\nI'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away\nI seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe\nOhhh, ohhh\n\n[Part II: SIRENS]\n\n[Verse 1: theMIND]\nI'm barely here, how I ain't present?\nYeah, I drift for a second, forgot to reply to your message\nBut all these years\nI been the same in your presence (I'm still here)\nCountin' the seconds before I reply to your message\nMy biggest fear (is that I have to say goodbye another time)\nIs that I have to say goodbye another time\n(Not like this, not like this, not like this)\nSo I skip town on our moment, hopefully prolonging this\nI don't need nobody new to miss (not like this)\nI want you to know\nOoooh, ooh ooh, ohh\n\n[Chorus: Saba]\nSirens on the way, ayy\nNow you're lying where the angels, lay, yeah\nSirens on the way, ayy\nNow we're lying where the angels, lay, yeah\nSirens on the way, ayy\nNow you're lying where the angels, lay, yeah\nSirens on the way, ayy\nNow we're lying where the angels, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Saba]\nRidin' through the city\nI'm young, I'm black, I'm guilty\nI know one time wanna kill me\nThey don't know me but they fear me\n15 years old with the sticky\nThey gon' blame it on the marijuana\nHands behind your head\nAnd they won't let up out they lead\nBut if I move thats disrespect\nBut if they shoot then that's just that?\nAnd if I run then that look bad?\nDrawing they gun right off their hip\nI'm probably deservin'\n'Cause I know they serve and protect\nBut they think I'm servin'\nOr they think my cellphone's a weapon\nHeard that the robber wore a black mask\nI fit the description, a.k.a. \"nigga\"\nWhat is the difference? It's an enigma\nWe so divided, I'm from Division\nClutch that purse cause of my dreadlocks\nCross that street cause I'm with my friends\nCurse every song in hip-hop\nKeep telling yourself it's all fair\n\n[Chorus: Saba]\nSirens on the way, ayy\nNow you're lying where the angels, lay, yeah\nSirens on the way, ayy\nNow we're lying where the angels, lay, yeah\nSirens on the way, ayy\nNow you're lying where the angels, lay, yeah\nSirens on the way, ayy\nNow we're lying where the\u2014", "album": "CARE FOR ME"}], "artist": "Saba"}
