I give you half of that\nBut I didn't know that she was on the pill\nNeeded the money for her hair and her nails\nAnd her cell phone bill\nHoes'll get you its like getting robbed without a pistol\n[?] come up on a nigga\n[?] like you not the one cause she ain't got no proof\nWhat happen nine months later when she was telling the truth\n\n[Hook]\nLet em put you on peep it though\nI ain't even want to freak the hoe\nI just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago\nLet em put you on peep it though\nI ain't even want to freak the hoe\nI just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago\n[Hook]\nLet em put you on peep it though\nI ain't even want to freak the hoe\nShit I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
