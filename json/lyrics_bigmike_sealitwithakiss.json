I stack\nEvery night and every day\nAnd don't give a damn to what these hoe-ass niggas say\n\n(chorus 2nd version)\nWe're sending letters to bitches who were about to get-get it\nSealed it with kisses and blew their brains when they read it\nLet it\nBe your first fucking lesson\nZero tolerance for disrespect leather connections\nI'm exing\nThese motherfuckers out like wrong answers\nGet a grip, I got a hold on your ass like cancer\nMake 'em dance, I make niggas do gymnastics\nPull and try to cash this\nSet 'em down in caskets, yeah\n\nIt's been a whole year and I still ain't fall down\nMy shit still circulate through y'all town\nIt's a small town but, compared to other cities\nIt really don't matter cause the situation's still shitty\nOr will they get the motherfucking picture\nAnd if I shoot and miss, then I'm-a have to get ya, hit ya\nWith something real, something harder to steal\nSomething serious nigga, that I know you'll feel, now\nHow many motherfuckers gonna fall when I come around\nHow many motherfuckers like y'all gonna hear the sound\nI thunder on your motherfucking back\nLike a whip when I flip\nYou'll hear that bitch crack your back\nYou bitch ass niggas don't want no static\nI'll leave you feenin' like an addict when I work my magic\nIt's like voodoo\nComing from that swamp\nI might do you\nYou'll get your ass stomped\n\n(repeat 2nd chorus)"}], "artist": "Big Mike"}
