Here's the pitch. It's belted deep to center, Revere goes back, jumps at the wall, and it's gone!\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nIsn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication\nHow beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing\nHow every conversation starts with \"this time will be different\"\nOh, the idea is fun, oh, the idea is fun\nOh, the idea is so fun every time\nAt least we try for home run every time\n\n[Chorus]\nSwanging, eyes closed just swanging\nSame city, same friends if you're looking for me\nSame city, same friends if you're looking\nI'll be here just swanging\nDon't talk to me like I'm famous\nAnd don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae\nI'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby\nYeah, swanging\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe just wanna run around the city and make memories\nThat she can barely remember\nAnd I'd allow her, talk about pussy power\nShe just wanna run over my feelings\nLike she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler\nAnd I'd allow her, talk about pussy power\nShe used to say: \"You can be whoever you want, even yourself\"\nYeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself\nBut when it falls apart, I'm always still down\nTo pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground\nWish you would learn to love people and use things\nAnd not the other way around\n\n[Chorus]\nSwanging, eyes closed just swanging\nSame city, same friends if you're looking for me\nSame city, same friends if you're looking\nI'll be here just swanging\nDon't talk to me like I'm famous\nAnd don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae\nI'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby\nI'll be here, just swanging\n\n[Verse 3]\nI remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is\nShe call and tell me be here before the sun up\nI be dressed before we hung up\nI take Eglinton to 401 east\nAnd exit at Markham road in the east end\nWhere all the pretty girls are sleeping\nMy license been expired I renew it after the weekend\nFuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends\nGirl I guess procrastination is my weakness\nI hate stoppin' for gas this late\nCause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'\nSummer is comin' know you could feel it\n20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it\nWon't knock on your door\nMy uncle say, \"You drive my whip like it's yours\"\nI got the pedal to the floor\nI'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'\n\n[Outro]\nDon't fall asleep on me, hang in there\nI'll be there just swangin'\nI'll be there just swangin'\nI treat you good girl like you're famous\nI know I'm late it's always the same shit\nBut don't fall asleep on me, hang in there\nI'm on the road right now swangin, girl"}]}
