I ain't her man just a part time lover\nAlways on the down when them haters trynna come up\nI like, the way yeah\nShe got the Louie bag and ahead she a boss chick\nShe's the one that you call when you're looking for a certified freak\n\nYou should see how she serves that body\nWork twerk that body\nImma murk that body and she knows it\nKush stop pour it\nHeard the bass line smack and she can't control it\nThere ain't a lot of freaky thangs that she can't do\nShe puts her heels through the speakers let the beat bang through\nSlow it down real saucy like dj screw\nHer girlfriends caked up so she came too\nFive star shootings on a bed of champagne\nYou know I go deep and she really loves the pain\nYou know I talk dirty while her girlfriend watch\nShe a certified freak certified top notch\n\nI like the way she movin on me\nI like the way she twerkin on me\nI like the way she move to the beat\n& shawty she a certified freak\n\nI like, the way\nShe know I ain't her man just a part time lover\nAlways on the down when them haters trynna come up\nI like, the way yeah\nShe got the Louie bag and ahead she a boss chick\nShe's the one that you call when you're looking for a certified freak\n\nI'm a freak and she know I need a freak too\nDrop it on me let the bass and the beat do\nSexy heels got them bitches wanna be you\nLouie bag, fendi tags they can't see you\nI got my own shit

just to fuck me\nAnd she ain't even gotta speak\nI layed her on the couch and i beat\nShe a certified freak\n\nX 2\nShe ain't even gotta speak, i can see it on her face\nShe a certified freak\nIt only took me bout a week, got her in between the sheets\nShe a certified freak\n\nRolling cookie, pouring up caesar\nBad yellow bitch with my hand up on skyzer\nLet my seat back and the hoe gonna slizzer\nShe do it too good, i can't be a fizzers\nDo it so good i'ma put that chick to work\nPut her in the strip club, let the bitch twerk\nThe money ain't straight then she gonna get hurt\nI will save no hoe, i ain't no church\nJuicy j pimping shit that's all a nigga know\nWe be so loud that's all a nigga smoke\nNo rehab for me all i need is dope\nShe ain't giving up the head, you can keep the hoe\nKeep the hoe, keep the hoe\nShe ain't giving up the head, you can keep the hoe\nKeep the hoe, keep the hoe, keep the hoe\nShe ain't giving up the head, you can keep the hoe\n\nX 2\nShe ain't even gotta speak, i can see it on her face\nShe a certified freak\nIt only took me bout a week, got her in between the sheets\nShe a certified freak\n\nAh, i pull my socks up and made some popcorn\nTryina sauce on your chicken in a hot sauce\nShe dancing like she wanna have a nigga baby\nWord to my nigga berner told the bitch you mainy\nIt's only one reason for this phone call\nTurn some pitbull on her she get lockjaw\nI'm on some taylor shit, kicks with the gator prints\nSay you getting all this money nigga what you make of it?\nI'm balling like a motherfucker then it's ride\nShe on her 9 to 5 and that's on her back\nTilt your head back, take a shot it is\nI'm on my 6 man like i'm off the bench\nWhile the club going dumb that's you baby father\nTell him i'm just tryina function, word to 40 water\nAll these bottles in this bitch you's a wanna be\nBut let me get back to a shawty going front of me, hey, hey", "title": "Certified freak", "album": "Ronnie Rey All Day", "image":
