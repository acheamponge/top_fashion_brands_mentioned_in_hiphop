Y\u2019all picked the right person to bring this shit to life\nI\u2019mma speak some real this\nThis how that shit go down\nI\u2019m the soul narrator\n\n[Verse 1: E-40]\nIt\u2019s zany on these dumping grounds\nDon\u2019t be slippin\u2019 with your pants down\nThey got some big shit hundred rounds\nThat\u2019ll knock you out your shoes and spin your neck around\nCrooked cops, crooked dice, crooked streets\nDark guns, dark alleys, dark reefs\nDon\u2019t get fooled by the palm trees and the beach\nThey wake your ass up, put the pistol to your teeth\nWhere the safe at? Where the shoe box? Where your duffel, patna?\nLost souls, they don\u2019t believe in karma\nThe fast lane, fast cars, fast cash\nBad bitches, big titties, big ass (who out here?)\nCelebrities and socialites\nPimps, gangstas, and hustlas under the streetlights\nThey\u2019ll run up on ya, make sure you with some real ones\nWhen you come in California\n\n[Hook 1: Ariel Pink]\nEven when it\u2019s flying high\nWatching the weather\nUp above, the city skies\nAnd gettin\u2019 it together\nCalifornia, California\n\n[Verse 2: E-40]\nCali, the land of opportunity\nSan Quintin and Silicon Valley\nWhere they learn to play the corner\nWhere they play with drumsticks that\u2019ll go through body armour\nIn the Pacific to be specific (what they like to do?)\nWhere they\u2019ll follow you on the freeway\nCatch you gettin\u2019 off an exit when you least expect it\nUnexpected, in the middle of the daylight where the traffic hectic\nBold, cold, these judges ain\u2019t plannin\u2019 on gettin\u2019 old, old\nGot hit now he layin\u2019 up in the road, road\nHis mama outside up in her robe, robe (her robe?)\n(Where you from?) West Coast!\nYou sick out this bitch, as I squash like this\nThe fog and the mist (West Coast!)\nI yell that shit out, that\u2019s all that I know, that\u2019s how that shit go\n\n[Hook 2: Ariel Pink]\nEven when it\u2019s flying high\nWatching the weather\nUp above and try hard to\nGet it together\nCalifornia, California\n\n[Outro: Ariel Pink]\nUp above the cities skies in California\nAnd soon we'll be flying high in California\nIn California"}]}
