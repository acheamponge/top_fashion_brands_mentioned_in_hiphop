You hit me, hit me with a little something...\nCheck it out, check it out... Check it out...\nYeah, yeah, yeah, check it out...\n\nI'm a innovator, eliminator of imitators\nI intimidate 'em disintegrate 'em with demonstratin'\nPoetical skills whoever gets healed better 'll field\nAnd they better at building mind's rhymes that never get killed\nIf you're clever never play me close champ\nWhen I kick it I get wicked I'm lickin' it stickin' it like a post stamp\nIt takes six, I can make hits accapella\nI should sell a million of and livin' like Rocafella\nBattle me? I gotta see m'originality of strategy\nOr that'll be another fatality\nRap and I like the sport and I write with thought\nOn the mic record adversaries 'll put 'em on life support I\nHeard your soundtrack, lyrics sound wack to me\nActually I'm the best around black\nT-Ray make beats, others take beats\nAbuse 'em use 'em to death but they'll never level the breakbeats\nThose with audacity tryina smash the P\nWon't last with me using their full capacity\nIf you wanna get deep, I made a big leap\nFrom corners, now I'm on a label called Big Beat\nPercee P's unforgetable\nWritin' recitin' incredible shit no-one else could ever do\n\nCheck it out, I'm out...", "year": null}]}
