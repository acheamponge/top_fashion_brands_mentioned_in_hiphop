Because together we\u2019ve got\nPower and we can make decisions.\u201d\n\n[Amir Sulaiman]\n\nJustice\u2026\nIs somewhere in between reading sad poems and 40 ounces of gasoline crashing\nThrough windows\n\nJustice\u2026\nIs between plans and action\nBetween writing letters to congressmen and clapping a captain\nBetween raising legal defense funds and putting a gun on the bailiff and taking the\nJudge captive\nIt is between prayer and fasting\nBetween burning and blasting\n\nFreedom\u2026\nIs between the mind and the soul\n\nIt is between the lock and the load\nBetween the zeal of the young and the patience of the old\nFreedom\u2026\nIs between the finger and the trigger\nIt is between the page and the pen\nBetween the grenade and the pin\nBetween righteous anger and keeping one in the chamber\n\nSo I say down with Goliath\nI say down with Goliath\n\nBut we must learn, know, write, read\nWe must kick, bite, yell, scream\nWe must pray, fast, live, dream, fight, kill and die\nFree", "year": "2012-09-18", "album": "Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color"}], "artist": "Brother Ali"}
