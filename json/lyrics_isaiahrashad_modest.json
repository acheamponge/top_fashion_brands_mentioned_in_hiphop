(Hey)\nOh, officer, just Boosie Boo and DG Yola, listen\nWon't let them haters get me down, that's what they told us\nIt's funny how they blame the south when they weak shit don't blow up\nWe came with all the funk while niggas act like they don't know us\nJust living a lie, OG's, acting like hoes, we couldn't rekindle the fire\nNigga, retire, nigga, catch up with the time, I can see more than the block\nI can see more than your spot, I don't be stuck in the past, homie, I'm puffing\nThe grass, holding my cup like a strap, look at my southerner ass\n\n[Hook]\nNiggas try to tell you what you want\nBut niggas rarely give you what you need\nAy, bitch, I came right here with the bounce\nAnd if that ain't enough I got some weed\nYeah, cause\nNiggas try to tell you what you want\nBut niggas rarely give you what you need\nAy, bitch, I came right here with the bounce\nAnd if that ain't enough I got some weed\nYeah, cause\n\n[Verse 2]\nQuiet, I be in living room, cuh, nigga shaded\nWith my Nia Long, I sing her a song, she masturbating\nThen bring me along, she got something to say like Larry David\nBut I leave her lone, ho, I gotta go, I got a baby\nStuck in Babylon, niggas carry bombs and carry rabies\nWho gon' speak for you? Who gon' sing your song if you don't play this?\nI got stress for days, picture you go home and you that nigga\nBut can't pay your bill, you can't buy no diapers for your little one\nDon't you pay for thrill, child support is like a check away\nHow you chill with Kendrick? Do you smoke with Q and Dr. Dre?\nLeast today is real, I should ask some groupie for some face\nJust a stepping stone, least them kind of bitches know their place\nThis my second home, this where favorite rappers get replaced\nThis what the niggas from the South gon' kill that, doubt it, bring the bass\nAnd bitch, I came here right here with an ounce\nAnd if that ain't enough you gotta leave\n\n[Hook]\nNiggas try to tell you what you want\nBut niggas rarely give you what you need\nAy, bitch, I came right here with the bounce\nAnd if that ain't enough I got some weed\nYeah, cause\nNiggas try to tell you what you want\nBut niggas rarely give you what you need\nAy, bitch, I came right here with the bounce\nAnd if that ain't enough I got some weed\nYeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/88da1904fb461fae943c2c34f20bda85.600x600x1.jpg", "album": "Cilvia Demo", "year": "2014-01-28"}]}
