Cos I got potential and\nI got the mental to be one of the greatest alive\nAnd y'all want a piece of the pie\nAnd they wanna seek and divide\nBut where was you where when I needed advice\nAnd not when the money arrived\nSo many tears that I had to cry\nGot me finessing I'm tryna to survive\nSo much invested can't get back the time\nWord to my family I gotta provide\nI'm on the grind grind grind grind\nAll of the time time time time\nI seen friends change when the cash came\nIn the court room giving all names\nWhere your loyalty lie when the time comes?\nCan't be loyal to the wrong ones\nFind out later it was never love\nNever know who you could ever trust\nI got my eye on the prize\nI put my pride to the side\nI put my faith into God\nI put my time in the grind\nI got the real for you liars\nPray for my enemy minds\nThey wanna tempt me at times\nBut I am too [?] inside\n\n[Hook 2]\nBridges always burn, bridges always burn\nTables always turn\nWhat goes around comes right back round\nMonday night and I'm up\n[?] you that I fuck with\nWhat goes around comes right back around\nMomma never raised no fool\nThat is not what she birthed\nRecognizing my worth\nI spit the real in these verses\nI am nowhere near perfect\nBut I know that I'm worth it\n\n[Verse 2]\nFuck bout a hater you miss me with it\n2016 is a new beginning\nI got a whole lot of weight on my shoulders\nMy momma just told me I'm built for winning\nGot the mind frame and my soul right\nNever go back to my old life\nBrand new ferrari the turn pike\nMy and my niggas ain't looking back\nIts a damn shame if you ever doubted\nI be laughing to the bank about it\nTold you niggas I'm the fucking realest\nSaid that I meant it I seen the vision\nToo bad I don't get the recognition\nToo bad I'm nowhere near being finished\nToo bad I'm whipping that new edition\nThat be the reason she pay attention\nHear them talking down but I never ever listen\nI don't never listen, I don't never listen\n\n[Hook]\nBridges always burn, bridges always burn\nTables always turn\nWhat goes around comes right back round\nMonday night and I'm up\n[?] you that I fuck with\nWhat goes around comes right back round\nMomma never raised no fool\nThat is not what she birthed\nRecognizing my worth\nI spit the real in these verses\nI am nowhere near perfect\nBut I know that I'm worth it\n\n[Verse 3]\nI am too motivated, I got it orchestrated\nShe gon' be cultivating\nI am so elevated\nPlease don't be devastated\nI was very patient I was too sedated\nI was being accomadating\nFuck all that humble I'm infiltrating\nFuck all that humble I'm infiltrating\nFuck it, niggas all good when you doing better\nJust don't do better than them\nThey might just cover the rim\nThey hate when you ball in the gym\nBut I will not let one of you fuckboys ever stop me\nExcuse my language now\nNot here to be famous I wanna be legendary\nMy flow is a cemetery\nYou sweeter than February, nigga\n\n[Hook]\nBridges always burn, bridges always burn\nTables always turn\nWhat goes around comes right back round\nMonday night and I'm up\n[?] you that I fuck with\nWhat goes around comes right back round\nMomma never raised no fool\nThat is not what she birthed\nRecognizing my worth\nI spit the real in these verses\nI am nowhere near perfect\nBut I know that I'm worth it\n\nBridges always burn\nTables always turn\nWhat goes around comes right back round\nMonday night and I'm up\n[?] you that I fuck with\nWhat goes around comes right back round\nBridges always getting burned\nTables always turn\nWhat goes around comes right back round\nMonday night and I'm up\n[?] you that I fuck with", "image": "https://images.genius.com/002c1ec02431344405111a1007c5307c.800x800x1.jpg"}]}
