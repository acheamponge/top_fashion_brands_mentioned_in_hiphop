That means tight and won't stop like a city cab\nThat means I'm not white but I figured do it big because the slum needs me\nSo instead of getting a beat from Kanye(eezy) who would probably take half my budget\nI could save the back end and send it back to Mogadishu where my family and friends getting patched up again you can ask hova\nThe hood is harder than you thought like a fifty chain getting snatched... in Angola? {Not sure}\n\nI don't expect you to feel my pain, but with respects to the rules of the game, They don't apply because I made it this far, stage down like a ghetto rockstar\n\n[Hook]\n\n(You know)x4\n(Kirk Hammett solo)\n\nSo dont tell me I gotta be the same, I'm tryin to get you to know my name, And with respects to the rules of the game, they dont apply because I came this far, stage dive like a rockstar\n[ Hook x 2]"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
