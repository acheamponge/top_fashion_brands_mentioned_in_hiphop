Who the fuck that is?\nWho the fuck that is? Who the fuck that is?\nI don't know that bitch, I don't know them either\nKinda look familiar, I done caught amnesia\n\n[Hook : Doe B]\n[Who the fuck that is? Who the fuck that is?\nWho the fuck that is? Who the fuck that is?]\nI don't know that bitch, I don't know them either\nKinda look familiar, I done caught amnesia\n\n[Verse 1: Doe B]\nI done fucked so many hoes I can't keep count no more\nWill somebody tell Hugh Hefner he ain't got shit on Doe?\nMy neck on freeze, my wrist on glow\nI'm high as fuck, I'm sitting low\nWant your ho, come get your ho\nI got her walking pigeon toed\nAmerica next top model, right here in my condo?\nI don't even know her name, I just asked her for a condom\nAnd she look like Rihanna, her ass is like humongous\nShe say she love my convo cause I kick shit like a punter\nBut I don't know her name, and she don't know me either\nShe just want the fame, I just want bomb no teeth\nLove me long time, love me, love me long time\nThe reason all my dates be blind dates cause this charm of mine\n\n[Hook  : Doe B]\n[Who the fuck that is? Who the fuck that is?\nWho the fuck that is? Who the fuck that is?]\nI don't know that bitch, I don't know them either\nKinda look familiar, I done caught amnesia\n\n[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]\nDear Lord, could you please have mercy?\nRock hard, bitch on me twerkin'\nBitch like, \"You stupid jerk!\"\nLook, I ain't grab your ass on purpose\nDon't remember nothing, guess I'm getting worse\nBMTP, that's murder\nBring me the pussy, you ain't ever heard her?\nNow we fucking in an old excursion\nGetting head while I drive excursion\nOn the phone asking \"Am I working?\"\nHe must want me to hurt him\nInstead of talking like its urgent\nWhere you know me from, I'm lost\nMan you about to make me get off\nIt was hard, but it started soft\nFish scale, what the hell, that's raw\nHold shots, come get broke off\nTwo paws, oh God, that's the law\nShots fired, man down, what happened?\nEnvelope, beep phone, I stabbed him\nTwo shooters, you dummy, I'm coming, get the money\nGot a bank roll in this bitch\nAmnesia, I have that shit\nAsk anything, I forget, quick\n\n[Hook  : Doe B]\n[Who the fuck that is? Who the fuck that is?\nWho the fuck that is? Who the fuck that is?]\nI don't know that bitch, I don't know them either\nKinda look familiar, I done caught amnesia"}], "artist": "Kevin Gates"}
