Get your scoping right\nUh, and I always got a badders and a good ting\nBad ting, coming round the crib on a wood ting\nLV, good ting, not a boog ting\nI ain't got no time for a broke or a hood ting\n\n[Chorus]\nI leave the crib when my P's are right\nSend my niggas to your door like the pizza guy\nDon't be looking for no smoke 'cause it's free, my guy\nMy akhs bringing out the smoke\nLike a shisha pipe, you'll get smoke\nKeep acting up, you'll get smoke\nYou're not bad for us, you'll get smoke\nCome and run your mouth, you'll get smoke\nLike a shisha pipe, you'll get smoke\n\n[Verse 2]\nTrap house is doing numbers\nNow my money works for me, I take slumbers\nEyes up exotic gyal with them bumpers\nPeng tings running me down for my jumpers\nWe wear black like we're grungers\nYou man are pushing shit like you're plungers\nI'm a cool guy, now I pay my own bills\nBut I still haffi lurk the strip with my hunters\nCome from country and punters\nMoney stack look real thick, it's one chunkers\nI don't chill with frauds or no stunters\nDem man fake like Dairylea Dunkers\nTake my Arab baby girl for dinner, then a show\nNando's, Butterfly Chicken, it's a go\nBuss the pussy, she won't tell me lick it 'cause she know\nI ain't built like that, nigga, that's a no, look\n\n[Chorus]\nI leave the crib when my P's are right\nSend my niggas to your door like the pizza guy\nDon't be looking for no smoke 'cause it's free, my guy\nMy akhs bringing out the smoke like a shisha pipe, you'll get smoke\nKeep acting up, you'll get smoke\nYou're not bad for us, you'll get smoke\nCome and run your mouth, you'll get smoke\nLike a shisha pipe, you'll get smoke", "year": "2017-10-06", "album": "Secure the Bag!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bb3ef87fb8c9b11455dd7d9d9c74fbf9.499x499x1.jpg"}], "artist": "AJ Tracey"}
