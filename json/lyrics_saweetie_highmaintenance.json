I need a hot boy\nSix foot with six figures and a big toy\nHeard he moving weight down south to Chicago, Illinois\nAnd he need a college girl to account so I employ\nCause I\u2019m a 5 star chick doing 5 star tricks\nGive him gifts all the time, I love his 5 star-\nWant a man with big, big bucks, money longer than my weave\nMy hair cost a lot, I\u2019ma need a couple g\u2019s\nNot a PlayStation, so do not play with me\n'Cause I will black op a nigga who don\u2019t gain with me\nSee I\u2019ma rider but nah I ain\u2019t a die\n'Cause I wouldn\u2019t take a bullet for a nigga, that\u2019s a lie\nAnd that\u2019s word to my mother, she the Filipino queen\nAnd she hella high maintenance, I\u2019ma get her what she need\nThat\u2019s some bling, that\u2019s some rings, man that\u2019s all on me\nClear her closet out and take her on a shopping spree\n\n[Outro]\nThat's right\nIcy", "album": "High Maintenance"}], "artist": "Saweetie"}
