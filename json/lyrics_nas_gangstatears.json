Scopin for police\nGuns on our hip, fiends want a fix, stumblin tricks (right here)\nWe left the drug game alone\nBrothers is jealous cause we still call the hood our home\nWhat could you tell us?\nAt funerals my eyes swell up (damn)\nLook at my dog lay in the casket\nTwin shotgun barrels had blasted\nAnd rest in peace Barkin, is all I could whisper\nAs I paid respect, kissed his face and felt hard skin\nIt's part of God's plan, but why so many niggas have to die?\nIt's crowded in this place, let the priest and pastor by\nBandana covers my eye, I'm scopin through the room\nI see killers and thieves, mob bosses and goons\nAnd yet I feel responsible when my nigga's pronounced dead\nInside the hospital, I wish there's somethin I could do, but..\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Nas"}
