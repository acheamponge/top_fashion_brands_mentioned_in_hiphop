Do your thing\nI'll do mine kid stay outta my way\"\nIt's type hard tryna survive in New York state\nCan't stop till I'm eatin' off a platinum plate\nPo po comes around and tries to relocate me\nLock me up for ever but they can't deflate me 'cause\nHavin' cash is highly addictive\nEspecially when you're used to havin' money to live with\nI thought step back look at my life as a whole\nAin't no love it seems the devil done stole my soul\nI'm out for delfia, selfia, P's not helpin' ya\nI'm tryna get this Lexus up, and plus a cellular\nYo Big Noyd! (What up cuzin'?) I can't cope\nWith all these crab niggas tryna shorten my rope\n\nYo it's the r - a double p\nE - r, n - o - y - d\nNiggas can't fuck with me\nComin' straight outta QB\nPushin' an Infiniti\nYou ask can I rip it constantly? Mentally?\nDefinitely, to the death of me\nCome and test me\nTrust me, nigga couldn't touch me if he snuff me\nSo bust me, you're gonna have to, 'cause I'ma blast you\nMy lyrical like a miracle, ill spiritual\nI'm born wit' it\nI'm gettin' on wit' it\nAn' I'ma have it 'til I'm fuckin' dead and gone wit' it\n'cause I'm a what? Composer of hardcore\nA lyrical destructor\nDon't make me buck ya, cause I'm a wild muthaf"}], "artist": "Big Noyd"}
