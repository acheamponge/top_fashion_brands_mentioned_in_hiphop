Almonds and Haagen Dazs\nAuction off your grandfather's watch, from the holocaust\nI'm iconic, making walking in the garden and bird watching\nAlarming all of these cardinals like I need a pope\nPuffing that white smoke, get faded and play the maestro\nI'm ice cold, bunny slippers, nice robe\nSneaky bitch stole my Rolly last night yo\nI might know some dyke hoes who can fight though\nWalking on a tight rope, underneath a microscope\nBut close up, we all just molecules and isotopes\nWhat psychic don't know the future?\nTo live life you kids might, just close your computer\nThe street lights might blind you though\nMake a collage and look at it through a kaleidoscope\n\n[Hook]\nThere's a bird in the sky\nLook at him fly\nWhy...\n\n[Verse 2]\nA little TV money, dollars for sense of humour\nScholar for my attendance like Bueller, so no use for a tutor\nSome cold brews in the cooler\nComing through in the woodgrain PT cruiser, stuntin'\nI'm pissed off like a blind person looking for a restroom\nProbably be dead soon inhaling cigarette fumes\nSorry for that blind people comment, that was just rude\nAnd I was raised better, say God bless you\nI'm Kenny Powers, you more of a Debbie Downer\nMy bitch taking off her trousers every time I get around her\nI'm nasty, I never shower, go sleep on a bed of flowers\nNot end of this conversation, I've been in my head for hours\nI'm out\n\n[Hook]\nThere's a bird in the sky\nLook at him fly\nWhy...", "year": null, "album": null, "title": "Avian // GHS"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
