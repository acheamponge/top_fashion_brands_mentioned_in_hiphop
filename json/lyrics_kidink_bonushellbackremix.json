And it\u2019s these haters that got me strapped\nParanoid by my friends, cause these favors done that got me jagged\nConsequence a bunch of all the misdemeanors that I was willing to do to get some rougher ends until the cops, woop, woop\nThen I'd hop the fence\nYou still owe me an old-school like Das EFX\nAnother call collect and it\u2019s sad cause\nThose are the friends that you grew with\nTelling me they knew that they knew I'd make it\nAnd now you got the chance to go prove it, gone\nPay stubs, cold cash, work this and I sold that\nWrote this in my notepad\nSpill more ink than my whole tatts\nSpill blood on that stage, uh\nI\u2019m the truth, and they know that\nCritics lie, but these numbers don\u2019t\nSay hello, to this gold plaque it's Kells\n\nYou can tell them that\nI\u2019ve been through hell and back\nWhen the heat is on\nI fire back\nIn this cold world\nWhere your light is at\nJust burn it down\nFire back\nYou can tell them that\nI\u2019ve been through hell and back\nWhen the heat is on\nI fire back\nIn this cold world\nWhere your light is at\nJust burn it down\nFire back!"}]}
