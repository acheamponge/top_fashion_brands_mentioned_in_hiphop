We in need\nTell her take it slow so she won't be another ho\nI can't tiptoe, coming late in bungalow\nGraduated school now I am heading down another route\nFresh rap got me far but niggas set traps\nTrying to tackle me from the stars but watch me get back\nWe did that shit on our own ain't have no dispatch\nCity on my shoulders and I'm working on my six pack\nNever got jacked knock on wood, cause thats what goes down in the hood\nGoing all around the world, but never leaving for good\nShe was riding me heavy\nGoing real hard trying to cut, my girl said she ain't ready\nTold her don't lose my trust cause she my favorite\nAnd she know I'm the best man, Young Taye Diggs\n\n[Hook]\nSo much smoke need oxygen\nSteadily count them Benjamin's\nSo much smoke need oxygen\nSteadily count them Benjamin's\nLook at all the bullshit I've been through\nLook at all the bullshit I've been through\nLook at all the bullshit I've been through\nLook at all the bullshit I've been through\nSo much smoke need oxygen\nSteadily count them Benjamin's\nSo much smoke need oxygen\nSteadily count them Benjamin's\nLook at all the bullshit I've been through\nLook at all the bullshit I've been through\nLook at all the bullshit I've been through\nLook at all the bullshit I've been through\n\n[Verse 2:Casey Veggies]\nThe youngin' jam smashing never on the bandwagon\nPull up on that mad fashion but I got my pants saggy\nAnything you want in life you got to start slow\nRealize, game proceeded to play my part though\nStreet gave me bad taste with no more ortho\nGrandma past away, like where my heart go\nDo you hear me screaming I just let the pen bleed slow\nAt 13 was spitting my story its all on TiVo\nHigh off life need oxygen, can't nobody stop me now\nThe girls took them greyhounds ? mean she bust it down\nGoing hard off nitro, I count cheese, fight foes\nThat say what up when I ride around but hate me when I'm gone\nNiggas ask for my studio I reply in my zone\nShe used to only call my phone now she spend the night in my home\nThings build and shit grows, we won't do nothing but get old\nDrive fast, don't bypass, just count cash, and stay gold\n\n[Hook]\nSo much smoke need oxygen\nSteadily count them Benjamin's\nSo much smoke need oxygen\nSteadily count them Benjamin's\nLook at all the bullshit I've been through\nLook at all the bullshit I've been through\nLook at all the bullshit I've been through\nLook at all the bullshit I've been through\nSo much smoke need oxygen\nSteadily count them Benjamin's\nSo much smoke need oxygen\nSteadily count them Benjamin's\nLook at all the bullshit I've been through\nLook at all the bullshit I've been through\nLook at all the bullshit I've been through\nLook at all the bullshit I've been through"}]}
