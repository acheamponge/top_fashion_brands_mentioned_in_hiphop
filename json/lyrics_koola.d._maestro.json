I don't know, war is hella corny and whack\nWhy they fly them drones that drop bombs on homes, there's real human lives extinguished\nI used to sing but now I just speak english\nBut yo fuck english, fuck America\nThis is stolen land, it's no justice on stolen land\nLife is hard hug me hold my hand\nI don't even know, god damn\nWhy did Bush knock down those towers? That's some bullshit\nWhy this nothing-ass fools always wanna try to pull shit?\nDawg I'm in the pool-pit, oh shit more base treble more volume to my mic\nI thought I told you I'm serious ma\nIce-cube with a furious thaw\nIce-tea with a curious straw\nEddie Murphy in Delirious raw\nTrading Places, Boomerang off a super-duper mane\nZooted to the roof off a supercane\nI ain't lyin snoopy mane, I'm stupid mane\nNah whatever I'm nice though\nWho cares, so what maestro\nFuck off suck my dick, ya'll suck armpit and I'm out peace"}]}
