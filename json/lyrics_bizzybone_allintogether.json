that's what I'm talkin' about y'all\n(All in together now, now)\nIt's another studio rap production\n(What are you doing to me)\nPlease believe me, yeah come on baby\n(I like the way she do's it)\nLet me show 'em how we do it\n(And she loves the way I does it)\n\n[Chorus]\nAll in together now (now, now, now)\nWhat are you doing to me (to me, to me)\nI like the way she do's it\nAnd she loves the way I does it\nMakes a brotha really wanna say\nAll in together now (now, now, now)\nWhat are you doing to me (to me, to me)\nI like the way she do's it\nAnd she loves the way I does it\nMakes a brotha really wanna say\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou can ride it all night, feel the erection deep in your section\nI gotta pocket full of protection, she's sleepin'\nI'm cookin' breakfast, heh\nStill gettin' followed by those hip-hop fans\nIt ain't a thang for me to get swallowed, I get zip-hop head\nLet me be your baby daddy, I keep sprayin'\nAnd please don't be that misunderstood, I'm from the hood\nIt'll be good to be dead, talk about taste that\nGet it on, don't waste that, eat it all, like asap\nVideo recorded, watch how we play it back\nDid it all, like way back, live it up, and lay back\nSoon as I reach my climax, hit the weed, and freak the black\nLookin' at me while I'm countin' this money stacks\nSo sexy, your man be cryin' and don't he say yeah\nYou could get the best of me, watch my back\nYou could take charge, while we in the car\nGon' make me lick that ass, be in your stomach\nAnd nervous you heart, talk about taste that, get it all\nDon't waste that, eat it all, like asap\nVideo recorded, watch how we play it back\n\n[Chorus]\nAll in together now (now, now, now)\nWhat are you doing to me (to me, to me)\nI like the way she do's it\nAnd she loves the way I does it\nMakes a brotha really wanna say\nAll in together now (now, now, now)\nWhat are you doing to me (to me, to me)\nI like the way she do's it\nAnd she loves the way I does it\nMakes a brotha really wanna say\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow many people have slept in your bed, it's one of my questions\nPlease, that's why we at the hotel\nRespect the presidential suite, eatin' up all of my strawberry's\nDrinkin' up all of my good Belvi\nWith a pocket full of magnum rubbers, double XL\nThat's what they tell me, anything, like \"B\" I love you\nBaby you know you lyin', you only know Bizzy, you don't know Brian\nYou think that my bud is to soft, I see you cryin' pitiful\nAnd don't get mad, you fuck 'em for strictly physical\nI fucked you with spiritual, up, my baby's mommas\nAnd she know who she is\nAnd she can never come get that taste again\nI'm comin' to get my rim, but I think you know this\nAnd I got people in the streets wonderin'\nHow'd you ever get close to one of my fortresses\nI gave you marriage, didn't know what to do with it\nConfused on top of the stick shift\nDidn't know how to work my clutch knit whit\nAnd I tried to teach the taste of temptation\nTo take the ticket, I had to leave you\nAs soon as you pulled that trigger, you so wicked\n\n[Chorus]\nAll in together now (now, now, now)\nWhat are you doing to me (to me, to me)\nI like the way she do's it\nAnd she loves the way I does it\nMakes a brotha really wanna say\nAll in together now (now, now, now)\nWhat are you doing to me (to me, to me)\nI like the way she do's it\nAnd she loves the way I does it\nMakes a brotha really wanna say\n\n[Verse 3]\nHere's the words, I love you like the Felatio baby\nDon't smother, we came at the same time, uhh, you like that\nEach silouette she teach pilouette eat me wrong\nDon't you rock that, little freaky deaky, sneak in the back\nOf the four door, you like that, won't you try that\nLet me put it up in the door...Roooh!...to the 'lation\nElevation take us standin' with wickeness\nTendecies candle wick and it's hot, you got me shakin'\nSoon as I'm finished, I roll up some spinach\nAnd fillish the village my niggas, and killas\nAnd dealas, got a low down work, and the bitch was mysterious\nSomebody wanna kill us, MOB like bail, bitch\nI'm best when I'm thuggin', check my energy out of the retro\nAnd I'm thuggin' in Columbus, yeah, long live the king\nAnd the queen, but our whole regime, and a beam\nFrom tipsy bitches, flip these tipsy bitches, lets split\nMan a bitch can cut me, fuck my homies\nBe a dyke and spike my hennesey, it gotta be satan testin' me\nOnly God control my destiny\nAnd your other nigga don't impress me\nWatch suckas for the lust of that deadly, meadly\nLove me, let's be friends, let's be friends\nUhh, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nAll in together now (now, now, now)\nWhat are you doing to me (to me, to me)\nI like the way she do's it\nAnd she loves the way I does it\nMakes a brotha really wanna say\nAll in together now (now, now, now)\nWhat are you doing to me (to me, to me)\nI like the way she do's it\nAnd she loves the way I does it\nMakes a brotha really wanna say"}], "artist": "Bizzy Bone"}
