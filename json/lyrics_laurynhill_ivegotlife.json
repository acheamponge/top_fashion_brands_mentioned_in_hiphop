"lyrics": "[Intro: Nina Simone]\nI ain't got no home, ain't got no shoes\nAin't got no money, ain't got no class\nAin't got no friends, ain't got no schooling\nAin't got no hurt, ain't got no job\nAin't got no money, no place to stay\nAin't got no\n\n[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]\nProgrammed inequity, it's in the nervous system\nListen, watch the words, how they twist 'em\nTwo thirds of the world turned victim\nSubtle energy, they capture and block chi\nThe unseen violence behind the democracy\nSome call it hypocrisy, turn freeman into property\nAnd logically justify not treatin' 'em properly\nInvisible ink in the constitution\nMeant to preserve the institution, unequal distribution\nOf wealth, goods and services\nRevolvin' door, no floor, just anxiety and nervousness\nTrapped in circuses\nHerds of us, not understandin' our purposes\nWhen appetites and psychological types\nGet caught in the hype, it's tight from morning 'til night\nI'm demanding my rights\nWomen's suffrage then black suffrage\nOr Jim Crow, the KKK\nAmerican terrorism\nMurders and beatings on television\nIt's in the cells now, you thought that was yesterday?\nBut the compression stays, trauma still got most afraid\nStuck in the memory, fear gives birth to lethargy\nGenerations of children in jeopardy\nHistory written in jealousy, scribes full of heresy\nFull of barbarians, ch-ch-check out my melody\nMusical therapy, reprogram\nAfrica full of coltan\nColtrane was a cold man\nBlack genius in a cold land tryna be the whole man\nHeal the homeland\nPast time for our own land\nWhere a grown man can be a grown man\nThe system has benefit for robbery is robbery\nYou can't run from it, God is a natural monopoly\nDivine creator stuck in monotony\nBureaucracy, psyche on poverty\nSelf-esteem broken like pottery\nNo more, not me, codename anomaly\nCause there's just no match for the prodigy\nSovereignty, the god in me\nWalking university, living cosmology\nWithout apology\n\n[Hook: Nina Simone]\nI've got life\nI've got laughs\nI've got headaches and toothaches\nAnd bad times too like you, you, you\n\n[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]\nOK\nThe more you suppress life the stronger it gets\nWith death life the longer it gets\nI know it\u2019s hard to admit\nThat you follow some bullshit\nSwallow the wrong pill looking for mr bill\nRepression, oppression: same thing (same thing)\nFear the shadow that\u2019s the main thing (main thing)\nThey keep running from\nEvery action yields an equal and opposite one\nYes that means the consequence comes\nFields of cumbersome back breaking labor\nCan\u2019t be healed with just a cummerbund\nI was homecoming queen call me number one\nYep that\u2019s another one, now give the drummer some\nTell every mother\u2019s son expression can be far more powerful than a hundred guns\nSee my Kalashnikov lyrics with the safety off\nNow dance around these niggas like Baryshnikov\nStreet sweeper my words are my keeper\nIt\u2019s in the ether, now what you trynna tell these preachers, It\u2019s done\nIt\u2019s done let loose your tongue\nGifted, black and young\nWatch these devils run\nThey knew a change was gonna come\nSinner man  looking for a place to run\nTell the truth in tongues\u2019 enemy reduced by one's\nThousands 2 can put 10,000 in flight\nSpeak truth to power every 24 hours\n\n[Hook: Nina Simone]\nI've got life\nI've got laughs\nI've got headaches and toothaches\nAnd bad times too like you, you, you\n\n[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]\n(Ay let me tell you)\nImperialism is a form of Jihad\nThey killed and enslaved millions for gold bullion, in the name of God\nThe children of mammon called it spiritual famine\nCan we examine, how they stole bauxite, rubber, labor, diamonds and platinum?\nThe building blocks of society and economy, broke humanity to build the colonies\nUsing reverse psychology to keep us from knowing our quality\nNo more human tragedy, no more mis-recognition, no more addiction\nLet\u2019s accurately diagnose our condition!\nListen:\n400 years of the abuse and misuse of religion\nDon\u2019t give me another person\u2019s prescription!\nI need what I need, my deeds are my deeds\nAs a man thinketh so is he, Mezanmi!\nTake the land back, every child, woman and man back\nReevaluate history, expeditiously\nCan\u2019t live my life in apostasy\nEmulate the apostrophe hang with S, you can rock with me\nI come in love and truth (truth)\nLook at what I went through\nNow it\u2019s time to acknowledge just what I give you: Life\n\n[Hook: Nina Simone]\nI've got life\nI've got laughs\nI've got headaches and toothaches\nAnd bad times too like you, you, you\n\n[Verse 4: Lauryn Hill]\nThere\u2019s a whole lotta wrong to be righted, I get excited\nI'ma kick this shit off like I\u2019m on Manchester United & my attention is undivided, so you can\u2019t divide and conquer me!\nI\u2019m sitting comfortably in a SUV, up in my SUV taking artistic liberties\nMaking musical history, a lil' acupuncture, structural integration, my meditation, liberating a generation & beyond that, I\u2019m taking the bomb back. I\u2019m splitting atoms for freedom, America needs more FREED men, able to talk right, not prone to GREED men (It\u2019s just not what you need man)\nLet your words and deeds line up, master the mind, young king man??, put your signs up, intelligent designs up!, plant your seeds, keep your dimes up, cuz no man knows when the time\u2019s up\nIt\u2019s elemental like Solomon in the temple, Ark of the Covenant, accountable to a higher government\nI\u2019m looking for love (in all the wrong places)\nSomebody tell me, where them brothas went, reclaim your wealth, no more giving the enemy help, no more sympathy for the devil, let'em hang himself\nGet all the billion Black people out of these bottles, suffer while grown people get coddled, you know the novel\n\n[Hook: Nina Simone]\nI've got life\nI've got laughs\nI've got headaches and toothaches\nAnd bad times too like you, you, you"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
