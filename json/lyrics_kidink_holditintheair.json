It's your boy Kid Ink rocking with the flat fiddy right now. Make sure you check out my new joint, ayo, Who Kidd!\n\n[Hook: Kid Ink]\nSpend all day tryna' stay humble\nI could show it off if I really want to\nThey be talking all that but who really cares\nI ain't scared to let em' know: Hold it in the air\nGot that money in the room (Hold it in the air)\nIf that fire in the room (Hold it in the air)\nGot some bottles in the room (Hold it in the air)\nI hold it in the air, hold it in the air\n\n[Verse 1: Kid Ink]\n(Uh, uh uh)\nHot as it can be\nYou need a tele-scope, if you tryna' see me\nI be hella, dope\nSomething like a picture no one ever need a cut is actually cause I be drinking out the pitcher\nKeep it coool\nI be tryna' chill but these niggas act a fool so I gotta show and tell\nLike a nigga back to school, sittin' on the world\nSee me spinning round' the room, walking on the moon\nCall me rocket-ship, shawty if I do\nHer pill just kicked got you biting on your lip\nShe told me that she want it, I ain't even gotta slip it\nI might leave with your chick'n if I catch you niggas slippin' (Ooh!)\nAin't no question yeah\nLeave this motherfucker bout' it\nI can spend it all, to-night, no cares\nJust run up in the bank like Clyde and my bitch bout' it\nNo lie baby I'm just being honest\n\n[Hook]"}]}
