He lied\nMan thought west was a joke, he tried\nMy block's just like a hornet's nest\nYour block's sweet just like a beehive\nAnywhere that we've got beef, we drive\nDidn't even hit him that hard, he died\nIf you get boom with the .44 long\nCritical hit, no chance to revive\nDon't think cause you've got a pouch, you're bad\nKnife in the pouch or not, you'll get skied\nWooden handle on an old school spinner\nHit man with the brunette, get dyed", "year": "2015-10-06", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/dbd80f4593432b9667b7fab9cffbf473.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "AJ Tracey"}
