MTV Raps' on 40-inch screens\nI learned how to tilt my hat, sag my jeans\nWanted a Nefertiti piece, thought that'd be fresh\nMe and my brother used to yank them shits straight off people's necks\nSummertime River Park jams at 1-2-fifth\nSticking kids with my identical twin\nIf I could go back in time, I would take you with me\nShow you what it's like to live a lifestyle to risky\nI put in work on rhymes and beats while you was putting work on the streets\nIt's bugged out, whoever would have thought that we'd meet\nBut it's this rap shit that made this whole package complete\nIt put us in the studio and put these raps to this beat\n\n[Hook: Twin + (Alchemist)]\nI never had shit (I always had it all)\nWe used to play with guns (We used to play ball)\nI used to pump crack (In school, I paid attention)\nI was a hard head (I used to always listen)\nWe turned bitches out (I used to love them hoes)\nWe wore hand-me-downs (I always had new clothes)\nI used to stay bent (I couldn't hold my liquor)\nIt's kinda bugged out (Two different stories in one picture)\n\n[Verse 3: Alchemist + Twin]\nI'm West Coast, I'mma rep it forever\nBut I had to move to the East to get all of my respect and my cheddar\nTo tell the truth, the only thing I really left was the weather\nAll of my friends the same, we always kept it together\nPicture this, 'Shook Ones' drop, the Mobb on top\nNow we rolling state to state with shows non-stop\nSeen the money Hav and P was getting off of the top\nOff of hip-hop, I wasn't going back to the block\nMy man Muggs introduced me to you, Nitty and G.O.D\nBrought me to the studio to play music for Hav and P\nYou can't forget my dunns Noyd and Gotti\nI was a nobody, they showed me love, told me they got me\nRemember the first time I the bong? I was doing it wrong\nChoking so much 'til my high was gone\nThen we showed you how to roll up dutchies, then it was on\nNow we rolling all across the country with hit songs\n\n[Hook: Twin + (Alchemist)]\nI never had shit (I always had it all)\nWe used to play with guns (We used to play ball)\nI used to pump crack (In school, I paid attention)\nI was a hard head (I used to always listen)\nWe turned bitches out (I used to love them hoes)\nWe wore hand-me-downs (I always had new clothes)\nI used to stay bent (I couldn't hold my liquor)\nIt's kinda bugged out (Two different stories in one picture)", "title": "Different Worlds", "album": "1st Infantry"}], "artist": "The Alchemist"}
