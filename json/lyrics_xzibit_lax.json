I can't tell\nSex sells, so fuck you all, we came to bubble and ball\nYou gettin' shut down, soon as I touch down\nBust rounds, enemies slayed and cut down\nFully automatic, spittin' rounds with no sound\nBreak down your whole regime, like an M-16\nMake sure the chamber in the barrel is clean\nAnd the spring that's connected to the firin' pin\nThat's connected to the trigger, when I squeeze it again, begin\n\n[Bridge]\nLook, my top of the world, the best of the best\nKing California, LAX\nOut the hood, in the penthouse, from the projects\nOne man, one gun, how the West was won, sing\n\n[Hook]\nIt's so frustratin', so many hatin'\nSomebody gon' make me break the law\nBut I ain't waitin', there's no escapin'\nYou better get ready for the war\n\n[Verse 2]\nHit like a heavyweight, breathe deep, meditate\nMake the whole crowd get loud, make 'em levitate\nI ride through my city, like a presidential candidate\nLAX, Phantom double R, and accelerate\nStack, build, elevate, crash through the prison gate\nGeneration hate, appetite to eliminate\nX-Man don't spit rhymes, I ventilate\nTraffic contraband, yeah, banned through the interstate\nGot a sick flow, didn't know? Let me demonstrate\nRenovate the game, new nigga that you love to hate\nThe left hand lands, and the right hand devastates\nHalf part of your face, replaced with a metal plate\nIrate, get snatched to a better place\nLet the detec's decorate with the yellow tape\nDetonate, drop bombs, make the earth shake\nIn Brazil, with a half mil' in the briefcase\n\n[Bridge]\nLook, my top of the world, the best of the best\nKing California, LAX\nOut the hood, in the penthouse, from the projects\nOne man, one gun, how the West was won, sing\n\n[Hook]\nIt's so frustratin', so many hatin'\nSomebody gon' make me break the law\nBut I ain't waitin', there's no escapin'\nYou better get ready for the war"}], "artist": "Xzibit"}
