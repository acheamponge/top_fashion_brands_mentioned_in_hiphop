(Ultimate)\nY'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)\nY'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)\nY'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)\nIn the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist\nWhen I'm ghost, I'ma cut the line, now you outta mind\nY'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)\nY'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)\nY'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)\nY'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)\n\n[Verse 2]\nMystical miracle, I build imperial\nI'm analytical, why Lotto had to be off to the clinical\nNow we're identical, black individual, no biochemical\nServe, fuck the cops they the opposition\nAnd these halfway niggas and these halfway hoes\nWanna be buddy-buddy they see you at a show\nBut be the main ones that be hating on the low\nWait, that's just irrelevant, they got the fact when you look at my melanin, woah\nCops killin' niggas, niggas killin' brothas, niggas hate each other\nDon't know, where the fuck they came from\nWe the ones that paid dues\nI don't watch Fox News, don't mean that all my foxes sly\nFind a little white girl, but let you die\nGun like a veteran, breakin' off barriers, they just might call me a terrorist\nBetter get caught with it than without it if I keep it concealed when I carry it, I\nPut them on paper, send them to prison and give them free labor\nSeparate everyone, make sure they neighbors\nAftermath, after that, we can laugh later\nFuck all my haters\nI raise up black fists as black as the raiders\nArming the gators\nFederation is my organization\nAll relation, no religion, no races\nBlack to Asian we the nation of U.L.T\nTrue to you so keep it true to me\nHaters cannot put an end to me because I truly know who is my enemy, nigga\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist\nWhen I'm ghost, I'ma cut the line, now you outta mind\nY'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)\nY'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)\nY'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)\nY'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)\nIn the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist\nWhen I'm ghost, I'ma cut the line, now you outta mind\nY'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)\nY'all niggas ain't U.L.T.
