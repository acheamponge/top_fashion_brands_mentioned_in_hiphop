Word\nTo all the wisdoms, living a fast life\nYeah, you rather see the light\nPump your breaks, know what I'm saying?\nWord up, it's reality, word up, yo\n\n[Verse 2]\nDriven by greed, she live in a plot with a knot\nBeen in the block with ten crisp Gs in her pock\nShe ain't stunting it, joint off safety, three clips\nPeep the rear-view some dreads pulled back her whips\nSo she murked off they murked too it's drama again\nJust bought a first-class ticket going to Michigan\nShe tried to come out alive grabbed the joint then sat aside\nThinking if she shoot first then her life can't be denied\nStarted blazing, shorty was no joke, she blinked\nUsing rapid fire, the dreads trying to hit her gas tank\nTesting Uzis, ooh-wops, the next man block cock\nThrough the action four bystanders was shot\nBut it continued, shorty hitting ninety, scraped the Benz\nStill steering, begging Allah for her sins\nWith no friends she had to handle beef on the dolo\nThree shells came through the window one went through her Polo\nNow she swerving needing a doctor like J Erving\nTwo other chickens that knew her, severe lesson they was learning\nSipping bourbon she reloaded seeing her life being demoted\nCatch a flashback remember shit Scarface quoted\nStill licking off shells, feeling the fires of hell\nLosing mad blood trying to make it back to the hotel\nDreads licked off, attacked, she had no chance to react\nFiring emptying clips from fifty-shot gats\nTwo more caught her in her back, the others made the tires flat\nThe car flipped thirteen times dun and that was that\nThat was that\n\n[Outro]\nWord up black\nYeah, yo, to all the women\nWatch what you do and who you screw\nYeah, be a queen and not a money fiend\nKnow what I mean?
