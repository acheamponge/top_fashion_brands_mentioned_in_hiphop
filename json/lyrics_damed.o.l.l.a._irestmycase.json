Don't tell me 'bout what was then\nWhen you was in your prime getting faded off fifths of Hen'\nI was rocking Js in my pop's Mercedes Benz\nUh, so basically all that money not gon' impress me\nI been on the thinnest of ice and turned into Gretzky\nEven if you cut me a check, you could never check me\nThis a epic moment in sports, I need a ESPY\nI know you only competing for some attention\nYou was hot then, but today, you honorable mention\nAll your closest folks need to come with an intervention\nThe General commercial's a little over-extended\nCut it short man, this really ain't worth your legacy\nRather get embarrassed instead of live with the jealousy\nThe game moved on, you was gone, she's no Penelope\nYou play with GP and B. Shaw, you know the pedigree\nA wise men said \"A clown gon' always perform\"\nRather stay in character 'stead of weather the storm\nYou can call me Damian 'cause my supremacy's born\nTold me sex myself, stay away from the porn\nI done talked music with Jada, Juvie and Weezy\nPusha T, Common and Jesus with me like Yeezy\nBudden podcast and do special olympics with Stevie\nNo wonder you feel a way, and I fuck with G-Eazy\nJamie Foxx, 2 Chainz, I really rock with the dopest\nI was in the stu' all night with Marsha Ambrosius\nYou gon' say you always had it rocking like a boulder\nThe real original was yelling \"No Limit Soldier!\"", "year": "2019-10-04"}], "artist": "Dame D.O.L.L.A."}
