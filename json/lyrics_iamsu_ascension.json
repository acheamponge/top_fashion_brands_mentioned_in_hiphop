I thought you were the one for me\n(Baby, I\u2019m the one for you I know it!)\nLike, forever?\n(I want this shit forever)\nWhat happened?\n(I don\u2019t know, I was tripping)\n(I was on the, I was on the bullshit like)\n(The insecurities in my mind just kept working in)\n(It\u2019s was just the bitches and the I don\u2019t even know)\n(I was tripping please)\n(It doesn\u2019t even matter like)\nYou\u2019re all I want, I\u2019m sorry no\n(Wait no, come back)\n(Don\u2019t, don\u2019t walk away from me)\n(Cause I need you, I love you)\n(I'm sorry, please, I'm not good without you)\n(Don't leave me)\n\n[Chorus]\nI thought you loved me\nI thought you love me\nYou said\nI thought you loved me\nI thought you loved me\nNo, no, no, it\u2019s not love, no", "image": "https://images.genius.com/66cb89c1f7d6b685d2378a90b777119d.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "Sincerely Yours", "year": "2014-05-14"}]}
