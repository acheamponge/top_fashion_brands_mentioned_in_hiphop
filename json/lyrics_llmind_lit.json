{"artist": "!llmind", "songs": [{"title": "Lit", "lyrics": "Coming off a pretty long hiatus of my popular BoomTrap instrumental series, I knew that Vol 4 had to start off with a BANG. This was the 1st track I made on the compilation and it set the tone properly. High energy. Unexpected drops and signature boomtrap siren. Did a lot of side-chaining here and really just wanted it to sound like CHAOS!! High energy chaos. Like you would hear this in the most underground of underground clubs with 50 people in a mosh pit, wilding out. It's lit. On fire, literally", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7d06d38d29128523f6bbe2db41628e3f.600x600x1.jpg", "album": "#BoomTrap Volume 4", "year": "2016-07-07"}]}
