Donalds\nShoot to the roof, nigga home sweet home\nBut ain't shit sweet at home\nExcept the chicks, pretty mamas who accept this dick\nI fuck a nigga's baby mamma with the high school with\nThey know Willie been fly, there's no Benny Highners\nI'm b, p, and t, purge baskets you bastards\nI got it mastered, midwest's best\nDirty south transplant, up town nigga\nI'm frequent flyer, I won't stop nigga\nYou know how I get down, I get around\n\n[Chorus x2: La the Darkman]\nEverybody want a piece son when the money comes\nSome are smart with it, some are just dumb\nNiggas will try to kill you just to get a crumb\nBut I'm from the hood, so I bust my gun\n\n[Outro: La the Darkman]\nThe honorable La Trafficante, man\nYou know what I'm saying?
