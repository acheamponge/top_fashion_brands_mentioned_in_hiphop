That nigga been .. to life\nMan hoes in him saying fuck the whole block\nThe garbage \u2026 city smell something funny\nNiggers keep stashing their guns under me, over the money\nIt's always some shit, the building is whispering\nThe mail box got a big mouth, she always listening\nThe sidewalk is pissed cause everybody shit on him\nAnd the playground think it's a game to \u2026 him\nThe cartable talking bout who's \u2026 gone\nThe sprinklers can't wait for the summer to turn it on\nThe grass \u2026from the bushes\nThe grass is mad that the bush I filled with \u2026\nI sit back and I give a thought\nWhat the fuck would they'd say, if the block can talk\nBlock talk block talk block talk\nHood talk, hood talk block talk hood talk\nThe chinese \u2026 is mad as the arabs cause they selling chickens too cutting in on they cash\nThe liquor store said he running the shit\nAnd if that don\u2019t cut it out everybody's getting hit\nEven the rackses talking, they \u2026 with the squirrels tell them \u2026 walking\nIf the walls could talk it's going down\nNo more fakeness, check your backround\nHood talk, block talk just imagine that the hood came alive\nI was \u2026 I wrote this, you had to nodes\nThis shit is so sick, so sick, so sick, so sick"}], "artist": "Blaq Poet"}
