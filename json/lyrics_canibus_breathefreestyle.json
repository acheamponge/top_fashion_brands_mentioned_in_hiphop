You need luck\nYou couldn't see me with a Jacob piece from Jesus\nI'll lean you back like your spine just cracked\nRhyme chiropractor, get to adjust raps\nSpit something, let me see if I'ma bust back\nI front back, I'll go your ass till you collapse\nSpin hats around like Sprewell hub-caps\nMy gun will clap faster than Savion Glover taps\nWave the four at you, if it takes more than that\nI'll kick down your door, before you get the double axe\nYou're trapped with Can-I-Bus, just relax\nI came to collect tax, it's as simple as that\nI raid your refrigerator, but other than that\nBefore I leave, I remind you to remember your wack\nMy girl loves Usher, but she said he getting cocky\nI told her, \"Shut up,\" 'cause that's the same way she knocked me\nIn the name of Hip Hop, I rock beats, on block streets\nThere ain't an emcee that can stop me\nNeed more beats, Scott Storch ain't cheap\nIn Virginia, DMP and Knotz got heat\nI get around like Pac and Shock-G\nIn a drop Jeep, licking off shots Sacchi\nIt don't have to be a special occasion, I be blazing\nI'm Jamaican, you know that I don't worship no pagan\nThis is real Canibus, leave your nose aching\nNiggas be hating, but on the low, they know the flow's dangerous\nThe Hip Hop Joe Namath, never missed a payment\nDon't say shit to me, you talk to the niggas I came with\nKay Slay shit nigga, Drama King nigga\nBada Bing nigga\n--"}]}
