You bite with the vamps\nYou got gloves, you can dance? I got a mic in my hand\nA red-blooded affair, nothing to fear\nEvery time this year we appear in the square\nGet it on, get it in gear. He gettin' at you? Get him in here\nWe gon' have to get a couple things clear\nThe art is here, no matter what type'a armor the warrior wear\nThe story of glory brought me to tears\nMexicano, Chino, Gringo, Negro\nTo the head, to the body with the dumbbell deathblow\nDo not let 'em go, cause I said so\nWe champions let's go, we all bleed red bro\n\n[Verse 2: Classic Pak]\n*awaiting transcription*"}]}
