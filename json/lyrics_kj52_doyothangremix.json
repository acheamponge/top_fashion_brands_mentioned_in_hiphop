B Reith)\n\n[Intro:]\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (uh huh)\nGone do my thang gone' still gone do my thang (hey)\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (uh huh)\nGone do my thang gone' still gone do my thang (hey)\n\n[Chorus:]\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (man I keep saying)\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (can you hear me say)\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (cause I keep saying)\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang\n\n[KJ-52:]\nWho's idea was this?\nWell it shouldn't been mine cause I think I'm gone quit\nCause what I've seen is the thing I don't get\nWell since a teen well I think I don't fit\nNow what I mean when I'm thinking on it\nWell it kind of seems I'm a little off bit\nCause what I seen is the older I get\nI'm a never grow up still a little old kid\nAnd even when I'm old and I'm balding\nI'm a still stay balling making crank calls and\nHauling crawling up down the halls and\nWhile I'm in my wheelchair while I'm bumping Phil Collins\nAnd I'll be leaning on the wall and with\nMedicare and a bunch of geritol and\nGrey hairs won't even be a problem\nI do my thing so keep talking\n\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (man I keep saying)\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (can you hear me say)\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (cause I keep saying)\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang\n\n[B. Reith:]\nHold up guess who just stepped in the room\nHere to answer a couple of questions\nOr better yet make a suggestion\nTo those who don't know me listen up class is in session\nLet the cameras click on let the press in\nI try my best to make a good first impression\nThey trying to box me in like a full court press me\nI been around the block now I ain't no freshman\nStay fresher than breath mints and even if I lose my swag\nI gotta let my testament direct attention to the risen King\nSo I'm a keep a doing a doing a doing my thang\nI got a message for the young and restless\nA new definition of what a true success is\nSo you loosen the grip of Satan's death wish\nKeep doing ya thing the way God meant it\n\n[Chorus:]\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (man I keep saying)\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (can you hear me say)\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (cause I keep saying)\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang\n\n[KJ-52:]\nAnd so I'm rocking the rhyme\nTo see you transformed like Optimus Prime\nIt's up to ya'll you can all fall in line\nYou can stop and rewind and get chance now to find\nReal peace that will open you mind\nSo you can cope when the times gets hopeless and blind\nI got a hope that I'm hoping ya find\nSo your don't fall behind when He opens the sky\nAnd if you're broken in life\nWell I've spoken tonight just to focus the light\nOn the hope that I know is in Christ\nCause the moment you hold it you know you arrived\nAnd if you came to get live\nWell it's safe you can bet in the place here tonight\nWhat I got it will change up ya life\nAnd I'm a do my thing one change at a time\n\n[Chorus:]\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (man I keep saying)\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (can you hear me say)\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (cause I keep saying)\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang\n\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang\n(uh huh)\nGone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (hey)\nI'm gone do my thang gone still gone do my thang\n(uh huh)\nGone do my thang gone still gone do my thang (hey)\n\nThis is how I sing because I can't sing\nThey put this effect on my voice because I can't sing\nBut if you wanna sing and you can't sing\nThen put this effect on your voice and they gone think you sing"}]}
