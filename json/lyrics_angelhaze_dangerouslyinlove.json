Nazi (not see)\nCut that bitch up, cook her, Chinese\nUs together, forever, Siamese\nDamn, a lil gone with my thoughts vague\nI know your thoughts too, this is not Haze\nLove and logic can not exist together\nAnd since I can't have both\nI'mma pick the better\nTake it all, take it all, you don't have a choice\nYell and scream till you don't have a voice\nPunch walls, go ham, you could hurt me\nBut don't leave me, cause that's the worse thing\n\nI am in love with you\nYou set me free\nI can't do this thing\nCalled life without you here with me\nCause I'm Dangerously In Love with you\nI'll never leave\nJust keep lovin' me\nThe way I love you loving me\n\nCause I am in love with you\nYou set me free\nI can't do this thing\nCalled life without you here with me\nCause I'm Dangerously In Love with you\nI'll never leave\nJust keep lovin' me\nThe way I love you loving me\n\nEvery time I see your face\nMy heart smiles\nEvery time it feels so good\nIt hurts sometimes\nCreated in this world\nTo love , to hold , to feel , to breathe , to leave you...\n\nHold up!\nI just, I don't know if I need to say this\nI mean, like, I understand that I've done wrong\nBut, my fucking heart is yours, and I can not lose you, like I don't\nI am in love with you, I am just crazy\nI am...\n\nI am in love with you\nYou set me free\nI can't do this thing\nCalled life without you here with me\nCause I'm Dangerously In Love with you\nI'll never leave\nJust keep lovin' me\nThe way I love you loving me\n\nCause I am in love with you\nYou set me free\nI can't do this thing\nCalled life without you here with me\nCause I'm Dangerously In Love with you\nI'll never leave\nJust keep lovin' me\nThe way I love you loving me\n\nI am in love with you\nYou set me free\nI can't do this thing\nCalled life without you here with me\nCause I'm Dangerously In Love with you\nI'll never leave\nJust keep lovin' me\nThe way I love you loving me\n\nCause I am in love with you\nYou set me free\nI can't do this thing\nCalled life without you here with me\nCause I'm Dangerously In Love with you\nI'll never leave\nJust keep lovin' me\nThe way I love you loving me", "year": null}]}
