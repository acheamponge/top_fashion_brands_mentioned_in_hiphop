King Masada\nLanded on a sick canvas\nNow I roam this dead planet, head bandaged\nInsane, preachin God's commandment, feel me\n\n[Verse 1: Killah Priest]\nI move through the dark regions, and won't stop\n'til we even, until you bleedin, until you stop breathin\nGivin careers a severe beatin for emceeing\nIt's something that I don't take lightly\nHow the fuck you ever invite me to a duel?\nI drool before I break fool, then I drag MC's\nBeat em down to they knees, grab your necks and squeeze\nTill there's no life left, they lifeless\nThen micless, what a crisis\nI give them a good night's rest\nI break they biceps, and triceps, thighs and necks\nBreast area is the best area\nBefore I bury ya, I make sure that you never ever, ever, ever try that shit no more\nKnowhatI'msayin? (Word is bond!)\nYour ambition put you in that fucked up condition\nLeave you with your own conviction, shit was not fiction\nNow you in a state of non-fiction\nMake you beg for mercy if you ever approach me\nI blow your head off when I talk, chop off your arms\nAnd bash your head in, you know where this shit is headin\nFor a dead-end, stop your sweatin\nLike Otis Reading, got your pants wettin\nSnuck up on you at your wedding, at your honeymoon\nTurn that shit into doom\nTurn your rap cassettes into your fucking caskets\nYou God damn bastards\nLyrics I mastered, rhymes burns like acid\n\n[Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard]\nI'm complete analyzer of your entire eye\nGave you no time to crawl, so walk on by\nI'm the insect in your pie, the hair to your lie\nThe good to your bye; your question to your why?\nThe wing to your fly, low to your high\nThe Dirt Dog, I be the God; the tear to your cry\nI drop in it, cleanse the Earth's\nMy place to birth strong, gave me the eye\n\n[Verse 2: Killah Priest]\nThe fatal brave to grave, the ceremonies from religious cults half man and half goat\nTomorrow hopes, based on the horoscopes\nWe followed goats, our nose and hella smoke\nFire breathin dragons, I rubbed the gold lantern\nTo the see the future through the crystal ball\nThe triple walls of fisher wants to miss the fall\nOffense see the coffin often\nI fell at the doorstop coughin, I heard the pipe organ (cough)\nSaw some men of a white origin\nI saw Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and George Bush\nBarefoot, sucking from the titties of a wolf\nUpon the brazen altar\nSix men offer their only daughter splashing holy water\nI ran for the, camcorders, now I'm plagued with curses\nI roam the Earth's surface, snatchin purses\nAllergic to catholic churches, what's the purpose\nReligious worship, is worthless\nI visit ancient sanctuaries, where the saints were married\nBut now they buried cause of Satan's fury, I faced the jury\nHeld in court like Christ nailed to a cross\nConfront my knowledge like Christ in front of Pontius Pilate\nDays of violent, standing in a haunted palace\nThe government wants my wallet\n\n[Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard] (x2)\nI'm complete analyzer of your entire eye\nGave you no time to crawl, so walk on by\nI'm the insect in your pie, the hair to your lie\nThe good to your bye; your question to your why?\nThe wing to your fly, low to your high\nThe Dirt Dog, I be the God; the tear to your cry\nI drop in it, cleanse the Earth's\nMy place to birth strong, gave me the eye\n\n[Outro: Killah Priest]\nIf you don't know... now you know\nKillah Priest, now you know"}]}
