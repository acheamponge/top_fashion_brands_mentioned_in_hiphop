Then what's the next step?\nIt's either 'yes' or 'no' before you take your next breath\nRemember the days you held me on your chest?\nI listened to your heart, gentle kisses on your breast\nYou said I was your king, or was it just a show?\nBut we don't even talk, so I guess I'll never know\nHow does a love so strong just fall to pieces?\nI believe in science and she believe in Jesus\nYo, what the fuck boo? I fucking lust you\nAnd plus I loved you, bitch fuck you\n\n[Outro]\nI miss you so much, fucking bitch\nI'll fucking kill you, but I love you\nI just want to kiss you one more time", "title": "Love Letter", "album": "Well Done", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c1ede5df22693a914ce708ed308bbad9.316x316x1.jpg", "year": "2011-11-22"}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
