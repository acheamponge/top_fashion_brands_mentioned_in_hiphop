Invisible seen as visible\nInfinite seeming finite, spirit becoming physical\nIt\u2019s odd man, God man slept and obeyed\nThe earth\u2019s confines, to breathe the very breath that he made\nHe would sweat, he would weep, even eat for his hunger\nDefeat death within three, so we\u2019d see that he\u2019s stronger\nCould give us anything even offer us wealth\nThat wouldn\u2019t be love if he ain\u2019t offer himself\nSo he stepped down from his throne and removed his crown\nAnd touched ground, though he knew he would be bruised and bound\nHe is now and then next and later on\nAnd still is what me and Crae can\u2019t convey in this song\nThough our minds can never reason this thang\nThe question is: do you really see him the same?\nAnd if you see him as sane, as the living God and matchless Christ\nHow much do these truths impact your life?\n\n[Hook \u2013 Json & Lecrae]\n\n[John Piper]\nIn order for Jesus to suffer and die, he had to plan way ahead of time, because \u2026 he couldn\u2019t die. Immortal. He didn\u2019t have any body, yet he wanted to die \u2026 for you. So he planned the whole thing by clothing himself with a body so that he could get hungry and get weary and get sore feet. The incarnation is the preparation of nerve endings for the nails \u2013 the preparation of a brow for thorns to press through. He needed to have a broad back so that there was a place for the whip. He needed to have feet so that there was a place for spikes. He needed to have a side so that there was a place for the sword to go in. He needed fleshy cheeks so that Judas would have a place to kiss and there would be a place for the spit to run down that the soldiers put on him. He needed a brain and a spinal column with no vinegar and no gall so that the exquisiteness of the pain could be fully felt. I just plead with you \u2013 when you\u2019re reading the bible and you read water toy texts like \u201che loved you\u201d and \u201cgave himself for you,\u201d you wouldn\u2019t go too fast over it. Linger, linger, linger, and plead with him that your eyes would be opened"}], "artist": "Json"}
