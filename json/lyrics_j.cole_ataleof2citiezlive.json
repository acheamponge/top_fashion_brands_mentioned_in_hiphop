Yeah, can I get a glimpse?\n\n[Hook 1]\nLast night I had a bad dream That I was trapped in this city Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?\nThey robbin' niggas on the daily Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things? Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?) Last night they pulled up\nOn my nigga at the light like\u2014 Ugh, nice watch, run it Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it Hands\nIn the air now, hands in the air Hands in the air now, hands in the air\n\n[Bridge]\nSmall town nigga Hollywood dreams I know that everything that glitters ain't gold I know the shit ain't always good as it seems But tell me till you get\nIt how could you know? How could you know? How could you know?\n\n[Verse 2]\nListen up I'm about to go and get rich Fuck with me my nigga We gon' circle round the Ville and hit a lick\nCop some tree my nigga And some powder, bag it up and make it flip You gon' see my nigga One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick And that's the key my\nNigga Listen up I'm 'bout to go and get rich Stand back and watch if you want to nigga Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch Tired of seein' niggas\nFlaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga\nWatch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga\nWanna know a funny thing about this shit? Even if you let em' kill your dream It'll haunt you nigga, haunt you\n\n[Hook 2] Last night I had a bad dream That I was trapped in this city Then I asked is that really such a bad thing? I look around like\u2014 Do you wanna be\nAnother nigga, that ain't never had things? Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?) Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like (You know what\nThe fuck it is nigga, run that shit!) Uh, nice watch, run it Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run\nIt Hands in the air now, hands in the air Hands in the air now, hands in the air\n\n[Outro]\nFather forgive me for my childish ways I look outside and all the clouds are gray I need your hands to take me miles away Your wish is my command, my command\nMy command But before you go I've got to warn you now Whatever goes up surely must come down And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found So\nWhy just take me man, take me man, take me man Your wish is my command, my command, my command"}], "artist": "J.
