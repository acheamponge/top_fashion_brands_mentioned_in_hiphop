Joe battles\nYeah, your boy had the original Storm Shadow\nAnd as of lately, things have been slow\nSo I reminisce on when we use to break them windows\nYeah, 'til I got snatched by the cops\nWith a Wiffle Ball bat and a hand full of rocks\nConsider this song a throw back\n'Cause all I wanna do is go back\nYa'll sing it with me\n\n[Chorus: Children's Choir]\nBack in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\n\n[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]\nTell 'em\nAnd this was way before PlayStation\nRushing home to watch Video vibrations\nMan, I tell you Sherry Carter coulda got the business\nAnd I can't forget Rachel from Caribbean Rhythms\nThis was back when Rap City used to play the jams\nThis is how I first heard about the Wu-Tang Clan\nBanged 36 chambers all summer long\nAnd to this day, Canopy's my favorite summer song\nAnd I can drop names for days\nOf all my favorite artists who helped to pave the way\nBut we probably need a lot more than just four minutes\nSo this is how I'm gonna end it, everybody sing\n\n[Chorus: Children's Choir]\nBack in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\n\n[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]\nYeah, I'm on the bus in the back lounge\nSweaty, cold, confused in another unfamiliar town\nAnother sold out show\nSpillin' my soul to a ton of people I don't know\nAnd I can feel my skin wearin' thinner\nFourth night, no appetite for dinner\nShit, goddamn, well, ain't life grand?\nGettin' paid to stand on stage with your heart in your hand\nSometimes I squeeze it 'til they get worried\nIf this is Groundhogs Day, I guess I'm Bill Murray\nAnd I swear I'm not complainin' at all\nI love each and every one of ya'll\nAll I'm really sayin' is...\n\n[Chorus: Children's Choir]\nBack in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again"}], "artist": "Travie McCoy"}
