I would like to give all thoughts and prayers to the people out there peacefully protesting. I also give thoughts and prayers to the people who could not hold their anger in because riots are only the language of the unheard. also give thoughts and prayers to the people who could not We usually come on to Queen\u2019s \u2018Champion\u2019, but I just got to tell you today, no matter how much we do it, no matter how much we get shit together, shit comes along and kicks you on your ass. Tonight, I got kicked on my ass when I heard that prosecutor. You motherf*ckers got me today, I knew it was coming when Eric Holder decided to resign. You motherf*ckers got me today. You kicked me on my *ss today, because I have a 20-year-old son and a 12-year-old son, and I\u2019m so afraid for them today.\n\nWhen I stood on the bus, and I cried, and I hugged my friend, I said, \u2018these motherf*ckers got me today.\u2019 When I stood in front of my wife, and I cried like a baby, I said, \u2018these motherfuckers got me today. You motherf*ckers will not own tomorrow, we will not bend to your fear, we will not accept your pain, we are not going to keep playing that race card, because we know you don\u2019t value my skin. We know you do value his (El-P), but we\u2019re friends and nothing is going to devalue that.\n\nThere was no peace in my heart and I wanted to walk out to \u2018Burn This Motherf*cker Down\u2019. But I got to tell you, I\u2019m from Atlanta, Georgia, something said, \u2018Just look for something [Martin Luther King Jr.] might have said,\u2019 so I googled Martin King and Wikipedia popped up, and he was 39 years old when you motherf*ckers killed him. He was the same age as I am, the same age as [El-P]. He was a young man when you killed him.\n\nBut I can promise you today: If I die when I walk off this stage tomorrow, I\u2019ll let you know this: it is not about race, it is not a class, it\u2019s not about color, it\u2019s about what they killed him for. It\u2019s about poverty, it\u2019s about greed, and it\u2019s about a war machine. It\u2019s about a war machine that uses you. So as I go tomorrow, I might go the day after, the one thing I want you to know is that it\u2019s us against the motherf*cking machine!"}]}
