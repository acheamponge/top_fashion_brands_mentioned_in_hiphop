Pusha T's more than he's seeming\nNot just a rap name, more so like a damn shame\nNothing's changed, just the crimes is less heinous\nThe three of us know, yet the shooter remains nameless\nAnd I don't even watch my back\nI was raw before rap, and I ain't lost my past\nShit could get hairy, I could lose myself in a flash\nNiggas'll think I'm Jim Carrey how I off that mask\n\n[Verse 2: Malice]\nI even went by the book at first\nUntil I realized 9 to 5 wouldn't quench my thirst\nSo I start my mission, leave my residence\nMama knew that a child like me had better sense\nBut something had to give, that's real, I had to live\nI chefed that soft white and pumped from her crib\nScout's honor, started with my grandmama\nWho distributed yay she had flown in from the Bahamas\nPartner, please, I grinds, I hustle with ease\nCan damn near eyeball any weight in my sleep\nI don't entertain hate surrounding the street\nIf I was you, I'd be tryna get down with me\nBut no, see these niggas know too much\nMeanwhile I rock jewels that look like my diamonds blush\nCats act as if rap fell in my lap\nI've suffered heartbreak many times back to back\nAnd still feel belittled sittin' here spittin' riddles\nAmongst clown ass rappers who tend to give me the giggles\nLet 'em take it however they wanna take it\nI'm the reason your favorite MC's no longer your favorite\nHey, I'm one of the greats, I can't lie\nI mean great to the point I'm concerned I might die\nMake no mistake, Malice is who you tuned to\nIt's all in the name, trust, I will wound you"}], "artist": "Clipse"}
