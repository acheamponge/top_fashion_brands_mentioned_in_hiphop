Martinez}\nHe was all I wanted\nLate night talking\nOn the phone, till day light often\nAt home he came through\nDinner on the table play fights forced him\nThe love was strong then, we went for walks then\nThen I lost him, I mean he still here but I ignore him\nCuz hes to busy for me, he come around few minutes then leave\nThings ain't the way they use to be\nThen I met this guy right down the street\nThis is what he said to me\n\n{Chorus}\nHello good looking\nTell me how are you\nEverytime I see you ???\nYour looking sooo good\nLemme show you gurl\nI can be soo good\n\n{A. Martinez}\nYo... uh..\nI tried to work things out\nBring things back\nArguments started, you don't know how to act\nCould have brought up fact how today\nI met this new dude and I ain't even sat it\nHe pro'ly would have thought I was playin\nAnd he pro'ly would have said stop playin\nBut its bull shit, I'm bout to stop taking\nCuz this new guy body drop, waiting\nI ain't playin, he played himself\nHe needs space or time or wealth\nYou can have all the space in tha world\nAnd ya man might find another girl\n\n{Chourus}\nEven though you don't know me\nBut what can I do\nLet me see you girl\nOne sturday\nJust let me show you gurl\nI can be soo good\n\n{A. Martinez}\nEvery girl need affection\nNot somebody who stressing\nHope he learned his lesson\nCuz in one direction\nYou can't see to the left,then\nYou stuck with a  dumb fuck\nWho don't understand, that one truck\nDon't matter to you, no car, krib either\nJust you and him in a two seater\nBut they always find out when its to late\nTelling me to wait, no you wait\nWait till you see me In his arm\nThen understand that I'm gone\n\n{chorus}\nHello good looking\nTell me how are you\nI see you gurl walking down on avenue\nLet me show you gurl\nI can be soo good\n\nEven though you don't know me\nTell me what I can do\nTo make me see you gurl\nOne sweet Saturday\nCuz if you let me gurl\nI can be soo good", "year": null}]}
