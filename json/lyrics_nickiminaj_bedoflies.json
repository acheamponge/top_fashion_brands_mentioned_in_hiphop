What you telling me?\nI could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me\nI ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony\nThis ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThey say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone\nThey say that your darkest hour come before your dawn\nBut there was something that I should've asked, all along\nI'mma ask on the song\n\n[Bridge: Skylar Grey]\nSo does she know I've been in that bed before?\nA thousand count, and not a single thread of truth\nIf I was just another girl\nThen I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you\nThere's one thing I need to know\nSo, call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself\n\n[Hook: Skylar Grey]\nDo you ever think of me when you lie?\nLie down in your bed, your bed of lies\nAnd I knew better than to look in your eyes\nThey only pretend you would be mine\nAnd oh, how you made me believe\nYou had me caught in every web that you weaved\nBut do you ever think of me when you lie?\nLie down in your bed, your bed of lies"}], "artist": "Nicki Minaj"}
