Negative, I swear\nIt's dough or die, I hope your soul provides you with an afterlife\nClose your casket tight, take your last two deep breaths\nAnd pass the mic, to Jay-Z nigga, that's right!\n\n[Chorus: Jay-Z]\nNow we can bounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball\nPlay if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss\nIt's alright, you heard?
