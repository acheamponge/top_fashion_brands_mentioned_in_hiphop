Can we?\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just tryna' lean wit' you lately\nCan I just see my baby?\nCan you walk it out?\nCan we talk it out?\nI been wondering whats new\nThat's why I hit you often, I'm not clingy, I just feel for you\n\n[Verse 1]\nHeard you wanna ride for me\nBut is you gon' slide for me?\nBad lil' shawty she walk in the room, I be there from 5 to 3\nHaven't seen you since I moved\nYou turned to a masterpiece\nTakin' your heart, might actually\nTwistin' the lock, got the master key\nWhatchu tryna do baby?\nWe got bands, run through baby\nAre you tryna come wit' a young G?\nBike could ride, honestly\nI'll show you what you wanna be, come fuck wit' me (yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just tryna' be with you, baby\nCan I just see my baby?\nCan you walk it out?
