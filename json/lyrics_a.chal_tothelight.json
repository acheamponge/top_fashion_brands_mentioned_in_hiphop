What you thought, love?\n\n[Chorus]\nI said I found a way, to that light\nAh, fuck the money, I found the li-ight\nI said I found a way, to that light\nTo that light, I got it right\nI said I found a way, to that light\nAh, fuck the money, I found the li-ight\nI said I found a way, to that light\nTo that light, I got it right"}]}
