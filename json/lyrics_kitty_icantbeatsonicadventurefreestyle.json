I could show you walrus's ball tricks\n\nPretend you never saw this\nI'll be at the prom in Givenchy, all lit\nI'll be at the pageant bringin' all this, all glitz\nI'll be winnin' sashes and I'm magic with the paw-prints\n\nLove carbs but I know to restrict 'em\nAnd I don't own no bras 'cause I don't ever fit 'em\nAvoid the college and fraternity, 'cause all of 'em dicks\nI forward all to my attorney, so it's always legit\n\nI never bother with censors\nI can't beat Sonic Adventure\nBut I'll beat all of you featherweights\nSay you're brolic, whatever\nAm I exotic? I bet\nAnd I been iconic forever\nI dig up all of the treasure\nAnd I'm biotic, I'm Shepard\nTell me I'm not on your level\nYou need to halt and get clever\nI know your mom think you special\nI'll pull off all of your petals\nI can't be bothered with censors\nI can't beat Sonic Adventure\n\nI never bother with censors\nI can't beat Sonic Adventure\nI never bother with censors\nI can't beat Sonic Adventure\nI never bother with censors\nI can't beat Sonic Adventure\nI'll fuck your girl and your neighbor\nNeighbor, with a B\nGod"}]}
