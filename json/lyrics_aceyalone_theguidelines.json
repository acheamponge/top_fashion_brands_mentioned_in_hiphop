{"songs": [{"lyrics": "Let's begin\nAsalaam alaikum, people of good will\nI offer you the greeting of thought manifested skill\nTo finally reveal the open-end chapter\nAs real as the flesh that you're embodied in\nTo the skull cavity your mind is rotting in, I'll be riding in\nAnd there might have been a slight, rotation warp to curve\nThe course of course I'm cordial when I report\nI won't distort, I don't contort\nConnect conduct collect console or conceal\nIn full control of the roll of the wheel\nMy eyes are my appliance to decipher the science\nOmitting defiance with the high-tech mic check\nThe buttons that flashed I pushed for absolute\nDestruction your structure is lifted from the ground\nThe foundation mound is broke, so you float around\nI'm embedded in what is known as beat\nLet it be shown, every enzyme is complete\nIn time, you'll see the pace of the pulse pump\nRapidly, heart rate, happily marched\nI happen to be the dark man who holds the charts\nI arch my horizontal line to make a rainbow\n.. but it ain't the same though, yo\nThe tried and true pros are chasing fool's gold\nSliding through holes, like small rodents\nIt's obviously, evident my embellishment\nPeaks at two-ninety-two I.Q\nCause Big Ace is the spinner, in the, center\nInventor, and I plan to be a winner meaning\nI'll be in the inner outer ovaries, overload, overboard\nOverseas hearin oversees more, than the eye can\nI stand, limited primitive, sentimentalist, escapist\nThe way I shape this landscape, automatically makes this, vivid\nI give it a rivet, hold it, stand at the pivot\nI love it, learn to live it, then give you my exhibit\nNot inhibited, not even a little bit, when I'm inclined\nMy attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines\nAnd you can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time\nMy attempts to redefine your hip-hop guideline\nYou can play the sideline, write rhymes in your spare time\nCause I'd rather stimulate your mind than emulate your purpose\nAnd we have only touched on the surface of the serpent\nConsider me part of the dust, in the dusk\nI must collect the samples from the rust\nPenetrate the crust then trust no living\nDriven by the sonic, language passion\nYour ashes spark the flashes, of the neon\nFrom be-yond, what kind of planet could I be on?\nI don't know, but I'mma be on, for eons, and eons\nWhile many think that they can never play out\nGet trapped in a timeframe, and never find their way out\nI stay off the dramatization, and I balance, always seeking the challenge\nTo show the world the incredible talents\nI cut the corners, smooth out the surfaces\nWorthlessness is just, half of the problem\nI read the grid kid, I did every column\nI note the animal kingdom, and the phylum\nWild style 'em! Until they get to hit the target\nI mark it on the bulls-eye, of flies, and the buffalo wing in the sky\nMy architechnique sparks the dark streets, of your resting ground\nI suggest that, you warn your town\nI inhabit the oxygen, mark off the memory\nYou will never forget to remember the lone wolverine\nMarine biologist machine, with the verbal, internal mind fertile, Foot, over hurdle tight, like girdle,\nAnd my word'll be the last, I incubate, every other millennium\nI fast and I hibernate, to pass any of 'em\nI am potent, untraceable\nNo color, no odor, no taste, no replaceable parts\nNo heart, no head, just a carcass\nThe darkest days come, right before the light\nI watch my watch and stand right before the mic\nBy the powers, vested in me, I digested MC's\nFood for thought, caught on to the end of the rope and swung\nThen stood stiff, as if, I was on a cliff\nNot beneath sticks, my feet are made of bricks\nWhen I walk my footprints indent cement\nI am not practical, nor am I unusual\nNor am I oblivious to, hideous crimes\nEvery city is captured and trapped in my mind\nGiven the spinal tap, as the final rap climbs\nMy attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines\nYou can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time\nMy attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines\nYou can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time\nCause I have become the night owl on the prowl\nMaster of the free penpal style\nCause I'm, om-nipotent\nI'm, some, government experiment that is out of control\nI'm from some big black hole\nI square up, select, and rec'd, every tangle\nI flare up, and you can try-any-angle (triangle)\nEven Bermuda, but I bury the barracuda\nThen I'm, octa-gone in the wind with the pollen\nThe pollen, the pollen, the pollen", "title": "The Guidelines", "album": "A Book Of Human Language", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c348dfe824da4f3b04231c7e4d629ae.700x700x1.jpg", "year": "1998-04-14"}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
