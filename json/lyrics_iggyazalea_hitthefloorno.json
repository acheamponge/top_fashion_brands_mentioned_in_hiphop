(Why do that?)\nThey be acting like, they done got the bag (No! Oh!)\nYeah right, how the hell your pockets flat (How the hell?)\nY'all ain't really got that guap\nY'all ain't really got that sack (No!)\nY'all ain't got the camera in the plate\nLooking at you when the car back-back (Hold up!)\nY'all ain't got snow on your wrists\nY'all ain't got a semi in your fleet (Hold up!)\nI would never do it like that\nAnd i bet you can't do it like this (No! Shit!)\n\n[Chorus]\nShot the beat and hit the floor\nWhat is hitting for?\nCopped a cotton candy mink\nI live in Cali though\nYou think it's sick i know\nI been that bitch i know\nLost some Ben Franks 'long the way\nBut i don't miss 'em though\n\n[Hook x4]\nHell, nah!\nBitch, no!\nGirl you broke!\nWe don't want champs, no!\n\nHell nah!\nFuck nah!\nBitch no!\nShit!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/76f39b66b2b431165a5f0061f648d4b2.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": null, "year": null}]}
