Ma.. Marty McFly\nBe the deciders with fire\u2019cos I\u2019m no longer looking in a reflection that I admire\nI paint a picture of a fire\u2026 But there\u2019s no one looking back at me since I\u2019m a liar\n\n[Pre Chorus]\nIf I should die before I wake.. The least that I could ever say\nI made mistakes but held on to my faith\u2026\n\n[Chorus]\n\u2018Cos when I look in a mirror\u2026I don\u2019t even recognize myself\nGot the heart of a winner\u2026 but looking back at me is someone else\nNo Regrets (x2)\nNo point in crying over yesterday\nNo Regrets (x2)\n\u2018Cos we ain\u2019t even seen the best of days\n\n[Post Chorus]\nOo-oh-oo-oh-oo-ohhh Na Na Na Na Na\nOo-oh-oo-oh-oo-ohhh\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis is my last chance, I\u2019m on my final straw\nI came so close to b-breaking like a spinal chord\nI came from nothing\u2026 Some kid in Camden\nNow I\u2019m flying with the birds.. Richard Branson\nI\u2019m a prince.. Yes I will.. Get the crown\nKate stays in my dungeon when her sister\u2019s round\nSo please forgive me.. If I make mistakes\nBut I\u2019ll blow the bloody doors off\u2026 Michael Caine\n\n[Pre Chorus]\nIf I should die before I wake.. The least that I could ever say\nI made mistakes but held on to my faith\u2026\n(Ohhhh)\n\n[Chorus]\n\u2018Cos when I look in a mirror\u2026I don\u2019t even recognize myself\nGot the heart of a winner\u2026 but looking back at me is someone else\nNo Regrets (x2)\nNo point in crying over yesterday\nNo Regrets (x2)\n\u2018Cos we ain\u2019t even seen the best of days\n\n[Bridge]\nI\u2019m free to be whatever I\u2026\n\u2018Cos I\u2019m famous.. Call me Gallagher.. \u2018Cos I\u2019m so shameless\nThe papers sold a page at the cost of my failures\nVictimised by the public\u2026 don\u2019t know if I can take this\nSo I sing \u201cSo when you feel like there\u2019s no more nothing left but the life you\u2019ve broken.\u201d\nNo regrets.. No turning back.. Pick up yourself and tell them I\u2019m just being me\u2026\nOhhhhhh\n\n[Chorus]\n\u2018Cos when I look in a mirror\u2026I don\u2019t even recognize myself\nGot the heart of a winner\u2026 but looking back at me is someone else\nNo Regrets (x2)\nNo point in crying over yesterday\nNo Regrets (x2)\nNo Regrets\u2026\n\u2018Cos when I look in a mirror\u2026I don\u2019t even recognize myself\nGot the heart of a winner\u2026 but looking back at me is someone else\nNo Regrets (x2)\nNo point in crying over yesterday\nNo Regrets (x2)\n\u2018Cos we ain\u2019t even seen the best of days\n\u2018Cos when I look in a mirror\u2026I don\u2019t even recognize myself\nGot the heart of a winner\u2026 but looking back at me is someone else\nNo\u2026No. Nobody crying over yesterday", "year": "2011-08-05"}], "artist": "Dappy"}
