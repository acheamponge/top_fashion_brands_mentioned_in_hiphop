Me and that gun was born siamese twins\nSo where I move, it's comin' with me\nYou down right, play with me, think I won't take your life\nThe scope'll have more dots on you than a website\nI'm 'bout my head right and yours left\nI swear in the vocal booth is where I'll take my last breath\nThat's K-Dot, oh you ain't heard? Shit, that boy hot\nWith dime bitches runnin' on beaches like baywatch\nYou sit and watch the young child with my money stacks\nAdd up faster than cell phones on speed dial\n\n[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]\nFor my niggas that hate the fights\nGet it with the Glocks\nGet it with the Glocks\nGet it with the Glocks\nFor my niggas that hustle nights\nBakin' with the pots\nBakin' with the pots\nBakin' with the pots\nFor my niggas that know right\nK-Dot is hot\nK-Dot is hot\nK-Dot is hot\nSee my game still the same, never trick on a bitch\nYou don't have to tell me, I know I'm the shit"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
