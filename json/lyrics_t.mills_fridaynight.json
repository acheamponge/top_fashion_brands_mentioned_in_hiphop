Try to keep my mind right\nAlways be a young fav. try and live that high life\nAll I do is smoke weed, chill, and make cool songs\nKickin' with your girlfriend. Prolly last an hour long\nI be postin' twitpics. See I keep my high strong\nCuz I'm on the full charge, I be on my iPhone\nGotta keep my friends around, they know how to party right\nI just turned twenty one. Find me on a Friday night\n\nFind me on a Friday night, Friday night\nFind me on a Friday night, Friday night\nFind me on a Friday night, Friday night\nFind me on a Friday night, Friday night\n\nI'm in LA, everyday, puttin' time in\nYou watch me like a g-shot girl, come be my diamond\nWe don't have to go out, you and I can dine in\nGive me all that pussy; open up and I will dive in\nGirls play me when they're drivin'. You hate cuz hoes be viben\nI wouldn't fuck with favorites. I'm sure it could get violent\nPlay you like a violin, I'm good on the strings though\nGirls be like he's hot but he's cuter when he sings though\nI wonder if he's single. It don't matter I been drinkin'\nWe ain't gotta fuck now, we got the whole weekend\n\nFind me on a Friday night, Friday night\nFind me on a Friday night, Friday night\nFind me on a Friday night, Friday night\nFind me on a Friday night, Friday night"}], "artist": "T.
