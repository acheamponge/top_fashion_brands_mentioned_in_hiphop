Y'better ask\nSomebody told me\nClosed mouths don't eat\nClosed eyes may never ever see\nSo I try with everything I've got to not sleep\nBut it's hard to run if at first you don't creep\nAfter work take the long way home\nSee a lotta whips dipped out in chrome\nThinkin about a house but I can't get a loan\nSo I day dream on my way back to my zone\nThinkin about my son look when he full grown\nWill he be raised right or another street clone?\nEverything I know God knows gotta shown\nLetting know he is not alone\nKeep on...\n\n[Hook, Estelle]\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's like I'm\nDrownin' in a world of failure\nBut\nI can't stop 'til my suits are tailored\nWhere\nI live I can't trust my neighbours\nSome\nOnly trust in they Lord and saviour\nI\nGotta believe in the fact\nThat he must want better for us\nLike young C gotta do it for us\nMy car broke down\nF*** the bus\nF*** the mayor\nF*** the city, laws are unjust\nIt's like why do I try\nWhen I feel I'm gonna die\nWithout a tear left in my eye?\nI work the hardest see the least\nIt's like cultivating the harvest\nNot seeing the feast\nI don't wanna get philosophical go-to deep\nI have faith but I'm afraid to take the leap\nMost of what I know\nI know holds me back\nInstead of learning\nI want that lack\nCome on...\n\n[Outro Dialogue]\n\n[Outro Spit]\nSome of my friends are terrorists\nSome of my friends deal crack and I am not OK with this\nSome niggas I know only back me because I rake dough like a gardner\nFuck it I work harder\nI don't like most hip hop out\nThere's a secret society of niggas who wanna shout\n\"turn that bullshit off!\"\nI should shut my mouth?\nNxt thing you know I ain't welcome down south of the border\nI don't believe in turfs or a section\nI believe in community\nWhere anybody can walk good without protection\nI believe that Dilla was the numba one dude in rap\nBut there on the slaps of haikus\nI spite you for not givin' it up\nFuck what that nigga say, nigga give it up\n\nWhy black people act like little kids?\nMake mad excuses when they know what it is?\nBe like them white folks invest that shit!\nInstead niggas is clownin' on the red carpet\nShowing my neice that a million on the neck\nIs the hot shit, is bloodclot disrespect!\nAnd growin' up poor don't make you ignant\nAct your age, don't act your pigment!\nRace to the top\nDon't let your race stop you\nFrom revolution\nOpen your mouth and bust shots\nRead books!\n\nYoung nigga say \"hello,\"\nScrew faces an' fuck me, we know you spines jello\nSpit what you been through\nSpit what you know\nAnd don't waste my time\nFuck your demo\nYa heard?"}], "artist": "Kardinal Offishall"}
