Bull, still alive\nBeat the track black and blue like \"How the hell it still alive?\"\nStealin' my style like \"Sab, we rock similar.\"\nUse Similac, sent it back like \"I'm too grown.\" Simmer down\nTaggin' they songs so it can come related\nThis for my dislikes, I hope you hate this\n\n[Hook]\nKeep it cool, come and knock, come along\nThis that calm before the storm\nThey on us 'til we at the top where we belong\nThey can sleep up or they be dawn\nKeep it cool, come and knock, come along\nThis that calm before the storm\nThey on us 'til we at the top where we belong\n\n[Verse 2: Martin $ky]\nA-plus, apex, predator to break necks\nHaven't gone insane yet, rappin' on the same set\nBackpack full of mild citrus for the session\nGrabbed a couple blunts and proceeded to burn the essence\nFar from being average, I'm an addict for this rap shit\nSat up in the back of the cab rollin' a fat spliff\nReally be about it, you don't really be about shit\nClosed circle, better watch the cash that you arrived with\nZoned out, vibing to this beat homie created\nI ain't worried, we the greatest; it's getting easy to make hits\nSweet sixteens, punchlines: these are them basics\nThem wack raps fill in the gaps, they close bases\nNo offense to those that don't notice\nHow my flow be the coldest, overdosing on dope shit\nIt would help you to notice things while I am present\nPresent rap killing, future rap legend\n\n[Hook]", "album": "GETCOMFORTable"}], "artist": "Saba"}
