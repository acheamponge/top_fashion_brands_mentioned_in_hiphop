Bitch, don't kill my vibe!\nWalk out the door and they scream it's alive\nMy New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution\nTalk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music\nI say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!\nBitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
