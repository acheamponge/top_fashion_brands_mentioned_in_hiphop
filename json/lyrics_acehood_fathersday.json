Who gon' wipe my tears?\nShe gon' pat me on the back like it's alright, my dear\nStill wishing every day I had my grandma here\nBut hey, that's the way that life is though\nWe all living just to die, the way this script goes\nShit, no answers, screaming fuck cancer\nStaring at a pic of my son, he so handsome\nFirst born, my baby girl, it's so special\nFaceTime to see 'em smile and say I love 'em\nFirst Father's Day alone, I had to suffer\nStill counting blessings cause they ain't got to struggle, Lord\n\n[Hook]\nHappy Father's Day\nHate it had to be this way\nHappy Father's Day\nI hate it had to be this way\nMy heart beats this way\nThat why my heart beats this way\nI hate it had to be this way\n\n[Verse 3]\nSee a nigga going through\nMake a change what I'm going through\nSometimes people never understand 'til it all hits the fan\nShould have listened to 'em, warned you\nBut that's life and we never get to do it twice\nI understand not many of us ever get it right\nBut hopefully you kinda close before you see the light\nThe realest shit I ever wrote in my whole life\nYeah, and to my son and my beautiful daughter\nI'm sorry I wasn't better for you and your brother\nThat bad blood in between me and your mother\nWe both did things back and forth to each other\nI apologize, go and dry your eyes\nThere's gon' come a time when it's all aligned, daddy's singing you them lullaby's\nMe and baby boy, throwing up the high five\nAnd baby girl probably passing me the pompoms\nNot mine but on God's time\nStill wishing y'all was close cause I know the way that time flies\nOn this day I was really in my feelings\nRoll another blunt cause I been trying not to feel it\nTears falling down on the pad on what I've written\nPart of me just gotta forgive, my daddy missing\nCause I am nothing like him\nI'm so unlike you, going through it like them\nShit, growing up right in front of your eyes\nFar from the perfect that we seeking to find\nThere's a beauty in the struggle when you growing inside\nAll my insecurities just on a platter besides\nI'm alive, I'm alive\nAnd besides, shit, I'm alive\n\n[Hook]\nHappy Father's Day\nHate it had to be this way\nHappy Father's Day\nI hate it had to be this way\nMy heart beats this way\nThat why my heart beats this way\nLove y'all", "image": "https://images.genius.com/15e2634e9261a18b03c9fc88c7fcdd4c.791x791x1.jpg"}]}
