{"songs": [{"lyrics": "(Is that a turntable? Well get on it, it's your turn)\n\nWho gets laid, the chicken or the egg?\nHow about the MC that has just been led\nTo a renegade teacher, preacher then he got stomped\nCause I'm a feature straight from the Bronx\nProductions, better known as Boogie Down\nIf I was a king right now I'd get crowned\nThe Nice is a teacher, not a prince or a rap lord\nI even write my rhymes on a blackboard\nTo get specific, and probably make you understand\nWhat makes the 808 plan\nIt's simple, I'm a round it off like this\nThat's how many stupid MC's I've dissed\nBut if the commence to try me I won't buy it\nI'll look them up and down and I'll say \"Don't even try it\"\nCause I can go on and on without breathing\nThe TR, another form of BDP-eating\nMC's like Chunky, moving real bluntly\nShaking and baking MC's like a junky\nFiending, hitting MC's like they was cocaine\nCalling them John Doe, meaning they have no name\nI'll spin you like a quarter, drink you like water\nHit below the belt with things you never thought of\nI lay down the law that I am a slaughter\nI roll like a tital wave, so you oughta\nFloat like a sailboat, move like a speedboat\nIn water, now watch you soak\nInto a rhyme of mine until you hit the bottom\nIt's heavy like an anchor, it's no problem\nFor me to just bake you, eat you like a cookie\nI am a profressional, boy, you're just a rookie\nI'm here to sing a song, but some are not able\nCompared to me you're just crumbs on the table\n\nIn my prime, more vocal than I've ever been\nI'm not an amateur, sort of like a veteran\nSplit from the bums, arriving from a long trip\nNow I'm back to just cold rip\nMC's like confetti, eat 'em like spaghetti\nI chill for a year and yet I'm still ready\nTo house MC's, sink 'em like a boat will\nI roll heavy, thick like oatmeal\nSo now you know the 808 is showing\nI do damage in just one moment\nHere's a little message to those who want to hang out\nJust remember that I give pain out\nThe TR-808 relates to a terrorizer\nNever hiding, clever always memorizing\nPoetry, history, math, or even paragraphs\nI'm not into b-boying, just hoeing\nShowing, blowing MC's like the wind does\nI might lay you, sort of like a hen does\nCause your rhymes are weak and unstable\nCompared to me you're just crumbs on the table\n\nYou must think, before you even get soup\nI'll put you on the corner and sell you like a prostitute\nLike a street whore, make you want more and more\nMove you to the side, up and down like a seesaw\nPulling out a gun is uncalled for\nBut I'm with it, so go for yours\nYou may even try to diss, but I call it flattery\nI pack more volts than a Duracell battery\nCharging MC's, smooth like the breeze\nScott made me funky, yo, that was one theme\nOr topic, showing I be rocking\nEvery little city I play I leave a heat wave\nBurning up the industry, never try to get with me\nI'm the type of person that never needs rehearsing\nJust a little sex, a six pack of Beck's\nAnd my room to move about, and a Guiness Stout\nTo make me feel able, chilling, and stable\nSometimes I'm on the mic, sometimes I'm on the turntable\nI'm superb, sort of like herb\nA man of my word and I've never been served!", "album": "Call Me D-Nice", "year": null, "title": "Crumbs on the Table", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eb0cb470ed0037a539adc0b84eb90ebd.432x432x1.jpg"}], "artist": "D Nice"}
