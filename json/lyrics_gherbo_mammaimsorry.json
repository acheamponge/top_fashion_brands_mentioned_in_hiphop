So I grew up, I ain't screw up\nNow you proud of me\nI remember, comin' in\nMiddle of the night my eyes red\nYou asked me why, and I ain't wanna tell you\nCause my guys dead\nYou so intelligent you always kept up wit' what lies said\nI'm so pathetic I could never keep up wit' my lying ass\nAnd raising me you never thought to worry, 'bout me dying fast\nAnd growin' up I never thought, my actions made you cry sad\nI just wanna say, you made me everything I am today\nAnd after all I put you through, I wouldn't have it no other way\nMa I'm sorry\n\n[Bridge]\n(You know all them times I had you up late worried about me)\nMamma I'm sorry\n(I ain't never get to tell you I apologize)\nMamma I'm sorry\n(You know all them nights you callin' my phone no answer)\nMamma I'm sorry\n(Comin' to pick me up from police stations)\nLook, I promise mamma I'm sorry\n\n[Verse 2]\nDefinition of a woman\nWhen our problems was taken over you brought us from under\nAs a youngin' you always told me I won't need for nothin'\nI just never settled for less cause I can't see you strugglin'\nThat's why I got it on my own and I stayed away from home\nCause I ain't want my sister growin' up watching me doing wrong\nAnd at the end of the day, it's my life\nI gotta learn from my mistakes\nAll I wanna do is move you and my grandma out the state\nPut y'all in some nice estate, name on ya license plate\nSo I grind like it's my time, even if I die today\nSo even if I die today I just hope you see brighter days\nYou always made sure I was straight\nNot a meal I never ate\nJepordize our friendship, that's a chance I'll never take\nAll the times that I would scare you\nYou would never run away\nNow every single day I wait to see a smile on ya face\nAll the rivers of tears you could probably cry away\nMa I'm sorry\n\n[Outro]\nMamma I'm sorry\n(All the lies, everything I put you through. All the times I...)\nMamma I'm sorry\n(went against your word)\nMamma I'm sorry\n(Lot of times I ain't never get to tell you I'm sorry for all the shit I did)\nLook, I promise mamma I'm sorry"}]}
