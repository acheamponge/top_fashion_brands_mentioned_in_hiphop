"Bold text = primary lyrics\nItalic text = secondary vocals\n(plain text) = tertiary vocals\n\nThree hundred butterflies\nThey wrapped them in her ribs\nAnd now she cuts across the interstate\nThe world will choke on traffic\n\nThree hundred butterflies, they wrapped them in her ribs\nMe and the cannonball's looking at the moon\nAnd now she cuts across the interstate, the world will choke on traffic\nWho\u2019s peeking over the edge like no-good-kids with water balloons\n(the apple in your eye is pretty rotten, it's full of worms)\nI want to swallow the wind, let it hollow me thin\nThree hundred butterflies, they wrapped them in her ribs\n(and worthless to be sold, filled with cataracts and scratches)\nAnd call a friend who\u2019s laughing like, laughing like a criminal\nAnd now she cuts across the interstate, the world will choke on traffic\n(the apple in your eye is pretty rotten, it's full of worms)\nShe watches fireworks launching and sparkling, spinning\nThree hundred butterflies, they wrapped them in her ribs\n(and worthless to be sold, filled with cataracts and scratches)\nAnd twenty kids live like giants making yearbook material\nAnd now she cuts across the interstate, the world will choke on traffic\n\nStep by step by misstep\nNothing more heartbreaking than\nOops, I found myself in someone else\u2019s shoes\nA car that\u2019s been stationed since\u2026\nAnd step by step by misstep\nWell, long enough, and long enough\nOops, I found myself in someone else's shoes\nTo let the grass grow up around its feet\n\nStep by step by misstep\nNothing more heartbreaking than\nOops, I found myself in someone else\u2019s shoes\nA car that\u2019s been stationed since\u2026\nAnd step by step by misstep\nWell, long enough, and long enough\nOops, I found myself in someone else's shoes\nTo let the grass grow up around its feet\n\nLater I\u2019ll kiss the smile off your face\nAnd toss this shape into the Rio Grande\nI could follow it along the riverbank\nTo reach the beach\nAnd we could roll around in the sand\n\nI want to break the bank, and crush the glasses\nChase the tape, combat molasses\nFace-to-face I punch the mattress\nAwake, escape, and trace the atlas\nThey case the place and ban the back flips\nLeave the flashes to the books of matches\n\nToday\u2019s the day\nToday\u2019s the day\nThey catch us\nToday\u2019s the day\nToday\u2019s the day\nWe turn it backwards\nToday is the day\nAmazing things happen\n\nPass the buck, I\u2019ve got a head full of handshakes\nNothing more heartbreaking than\nDig a little deeper \u2018til the hole runs dry\nA car that\u2019s been stationed since\u2026\nAs the light from the television flickers on the table\nWell, long enough, and long enough\nAnd the angel on my shoulder wipes the sleep from his eyes\nTo let the grass grow up around its feet\n\nPass the buck, I\u2019ve got a head full of handshakes\nNothing more heartbreaking than\nDig a little deeper \u2018til the hole runs dry\nA car that\u2019s been stationed since\u2026\nAs the light from the television flickers on the table\nWell, long enough, and long enough\nAnd the angel on my shoulder wipes the sleep from his eyes\nTo let the grass grow up around its feet\n\nPass the buck, I\u2019ve got a head full of handshakes\nNothing more heartbreaking than\n(we're looking in)\nDig a little deeper \u2018til the hole runs dry\nA car that\u2019s been stationed since\u2026\nAs the light from the television flickers on the table\nWell, long enough, and long enough\n(on a better life)\nAnd the angel on my shoulder wipes the sleep from his eyes\nTo let the grass grow up around its feet\n\nPass the buck, I\u2019ve got a head full of handshakes\nNothing more heartbreaking than\n(with our faces)\nDig a little deeper \u2018til the hole runs dry\nA car that\u2019s been stationed since\u2026\nAs the light from the television flickers on the table\n(pressed against the glass)\nWell, long enough, and long enough\nAnd the angel on my shoulder wipes the sleep from his eyes\nTo let the grass grow up around its feet\n(and now you've turned away)\n\nI want to jump a million miles\nLook back at the
