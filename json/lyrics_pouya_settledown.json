Does love ever die?\nSettle down, my darling, I'll be fine\nWhat is love? Does love ever die?\n\n[Verse 1: Midnight Rush]\nI tell lies to keep you by my side, I know that\nFeeling right, when my style, bring this life in and out\nWatch a teardrop running down your face\nI broke your love but here is where your heart stays and it goes\nForgotten soul with no place to go\nYou left me 'lone with an empty home, staring at my phone\nI'm standing in the rain, the pain don't show\nAnd now I know how I crushed your soul\nSo now I don't feel whole\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Midnight Rush]\nI slip here in my lair, your set fades, wastin' days\nI'm okay, we part ways, love don't stay in no lane\nI slip here in my lair, your set fades, wastin' days\nI'm okay, we part ways, love don't stay in no lane\n\n[Chorus: Midnight Rush]\nSettle down, my darling, I'll be fine\nWhat is love? Does love ever die?\nSettle down, my darling, I'll be fine\nWhat is love? Does love ever die?\n\n[Verse 2: Midnight Rush]\nI need your love tonight\nEven if it's artificial love from you\nI need you one more night\nNothing matters long as I'm next to you\nThey tell me you're using me\nWell, maybe I just like to be used\nYou can hide the truth from me (You can hide the truth from me)\nNothing matters long as I'm next to you, girl\n\n[Chorus: Midnight Rush]\nSettle down, my darling, I'll be fine\nWhat is love? Does love ever die?\nSettle down, my darling, I'll be fine\nWhat is love? Does love ever die?\n\n[Verse 3: Pouya]\nFeelings feeling like seasons\nToo many changes, not too many reasons\nDid you wanna fight? You don't want a reason\nLocking up the doors, I'm close to leavin', yeah\nChange my mind, double back\nFell in love in the back of my 'Lac\nWhere you think the suicidal thoughts came from?\nYou playin' with my head got me stuck in a trance\nEvil bitch, now I know what you're made of\nI need to swallow half of my pride\nCan't deal with all of these lies\nOnly two seats in my ride\nWell, one of them be for you\nI know you wanna live that life\nJust give me a green light\nI could change it all in one night\nIf you really wanted me to, yeah\n\n[Chorus: Midnight Rush]\nSettle down, my darling, I'll be fine\nWhat is love? Does love ever die?\nSettle down, my darling, I'll be fine\nWhat is love? Does love ever die?", "year": "2019-07-01"}]}
