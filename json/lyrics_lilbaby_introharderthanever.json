(Ya dig)\nMan, this that new wave shit, ya dig? (4 Pockets Full)\nKnow what I'm sayin'? Watch them eat this one up (know what I'm saying?)\nOkay\nFree the gang\n\n[Verse]\nI'm smoking loud this that moonrock\nThey tryna sue me cause I'm gettin' paper\nI dropped out of school didn't get no education\nMy momma, she happy 'cause I finally made it\nShe living better, her house big as fuck\nBuy her a Bentayga Bentley truck\nWith a AP today, tomorrow switch it up\nHoneycomb diamonds VVS's cuttin'\nStanding on stage, I really came from nothing\nI took me a break, don't mean I'm getting rusty\nI'm gaining this weight they say I'm getting husky\nI stand on front line I'm all about the fuckery\nI go where I want, nobody better not fuck with me\nExtended the glizzy shoot it 'til it's empty\nI come from the projects jumping over fences\nI found me a plug and went and made a killing\nI think we in love we should just have some children\nThem narcs I been sipping got to have me trippin'\nI didn\u2019t come to play I had to reinvent me\nI handled my business now I'm worth some millions\nRemember the safe deposit box was empty\nThem niggas weren't fucking with me they weren't friendly\nIf you weren't with me then, you ain't seeing him with me\nWe like Kanye and K, you like Bobby and Whitney\nReal dope boy I ain't nothing' like the weirdos\nNever seen me putting on the weird clothes\nIt cost a lil' more when it's real gold\nWe already up keep the field goal\nRemember that day that I had lost all that cake\nI had to go in the safe\nI had to get me a pot and cook that shit up\nHad 'em calling me Quay\nI had got that shit back in like twenty-some-days\nAin\u2019t no chump change, I\u2019m talkin' bout' 500k\nI went straight to the lot and went bought me a wraith\nAin't no more being humble put it in they face\nI won't feed in the drama I'm \ufffcloving the hate\nBut one thing for sure, Lil Baby go crazy"}], "artist": "Lil Baby"}
