Man", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nDear God it's me transmittin' from\nThis tiny place I live in Harlem\nOh Heaven we have a problem\n'Cause we've lost all correspondence\nAnd there's no more prophets\nThey've all been replaced with politics\nAnd they have your people hostage\nThat's why I'm sending you this postage\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you're listening Mr. U.F.O. Man\nSpeak to Jesus tell Him we're on Earth and\nThings are worse than they have ever been now\nFather it's urgent we need you come down\n\n[Verse 2: John Ostby]\nHey now, you're my father\nAnd I don't know what's out there\nSo many of us are scared\nHey now, we got people shooting people\nWe live in warfare\nI'm not talking nuclear\nI ain't got there yet\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhy we got intelligent mouths\nOn Larry King with religious doubts\nWhile the rabbi and minister fuss\nShit another one bites the dust\nSo the yellow red black and white\nSend missiles in the dark of night\nProbably wanna stop but don't know how\nThat's why Lord we really need you now\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nPeople around, if you feel our vibe ride\nCome on aboard there's enough room inside\nWe're flying high where heaven hides\nHope I see you on the other side\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]"}], "artist": "Kelis"}
