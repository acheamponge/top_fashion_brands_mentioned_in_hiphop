Either way you have to pay dues\nThey say we all born to lose, we're set up to fail\nI\u2019m on my roof top, \"Victory!\" I yell\nLike Obama did it with the girls and Michelle\nI look at this government and load up my shells\n\n[Hook: Killah Priest]\nGlory, money, judgement, fame\nDemons, temple, alter, the flames\nParadise, Ein Sof Paradise\nThe Glory, the money, the judgement, the fame\nThe Demons, the temple, the alter, the flames\nParadise, Ein Sof Paradise\n\n[Outro: Killah Priest]\nUh, Let us pray\nA story of a man, who told a story of another man\nWho told a story of another man\nEin Sof, Keter the Tiferet\nYou know, the tree of life inside the tree\nLook inside"}]}
