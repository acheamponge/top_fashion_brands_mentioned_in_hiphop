Priest\nYou still gon' at it?\n\n[Chorus] (x2)\nSo look at life, where will it take us?\nInto the lights, stay strong and don't break up\nBand together, the strength and unity\nBe strong and live longer, this is not ya eulogy\n\n[Verse 1]\nDearly beloved we gather here to celebrate life\nPeace to Empuls he found my wife\nMay y'all never depart, I reach deep into my heart\nPull out every foul thing I've done\nWhere my eyes browse upon my son\nRemember y'all the one so listen\nGot a third part, which is the best part\nSo when you get out in the world the game of chess starts\nRemember concentrate before you make a move\nDeal with the truth in ya square\nAnd remember God is in you\nSo you don't have to search outside the Earth\nJust go inside this verse, plant the seeds in ya mind\nWatch it grow high as a turf\nJust look around - remember you are the Church\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nVictory is yours if you lead of course\nEnd all, make sure you know what ya end is for\nRemember every seed is pure, military wants you\nThe cemetery will taunt you if you let it\nHelp you escape the hands of the medics\nPerfection and this message\nYou my sons, my reflection\nAnd this is a deep lesson if you keep stressing\nWill bring about a deep depression\nThe only answers is your friends in a weed session\nLook read a Proverb a day, observe life's survey\nThink of my grandma in the words should say..\n\"Don't run down the halls\" Now she's joined with the Lord\nWalking down the halls, bless it the all\nPeople rise, some fall, stand tall\nY'all gon' be the next leaders\nEcclesiastes, the words of the preacher\nHear the teacher\n\n[Chorus]"}]}
