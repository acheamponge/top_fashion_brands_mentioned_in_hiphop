Oh, you won't come\nYou got sand in your gas tank, your shit won't run\nI'm still hungry where's that last steak\nFuck it, cut out your prostate and work with that\nI take the OJ glove, nigga, jerk with that\nSpit's that'll crack your back, oh really, hurt your back\nI got problems like COS don't desert the fact\nAnd the fact is I was the sickest amongst the black kids\nSitting in the corner at 14 and crack lids on the 4-0\n4 years later, I'm out the 4-door\nDumping at your afro soon as you pass go\nI'm The Last Mohican, I feed off your belly leakin'\nI hear what your talking but can't feel what your speakin'\nFrom the Gardens to Creek and all the way from Monday to the weekend\nI get high, get drunk, and fuck somebody's sweet lips in the mouth\nCatch these fucking hollow tips in the mouth, it's Sacramento's dirty South, nigga\n\n[Bridge]\nYeah\nReally don't matter (Right up to your face and diss you)\nCause I get's off like a motherfucker, you know\nAnd it's real chopper (Right up to your face and diss you)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm a one-man ten-thousand day war\nSee fuck the score, I'm-a still play hard\nAnd like tits in my face I'm-a stay hard\nAnd playing you is like playing cards\nSee, playing me is likely to never happen\nGot funk? [?]\nForever pack your metal, I demonstrate it to several\nI spit like diarrhea, I wish you would to see a\nRipgut nigga that'll split up your guts, like, meat market\nIt's built raps like a carpenter, graze you like a pencil sharpener\nDon't get me started up, I'm 350 rocket\n.380 in my pocket and I don't have to cock it\nI keep it knocking from Sacramento to Chicago, roll like\n12-gauge in the El Dorado, I'm so tight\nSpiderman through your night on these niggas\nCommitting sin, try it again, I'm the one supplying the gin\nYour shit is watered down, can I bring your daughter down like out of town\nPlus I nut on faces, you niggas fake like a oasis, hit you\nGet away with no traces with you, like Jason did you\nSee I get's off\n\n[Hook]\nSee I can be like 60 years old\nBut still I'm-a eat meat\nI mean I'm-a still eat niggas up\nNigga you got me fucked up\nMix professional with nigga shit\nAbout to get tucked up you fucked up\nTime to get in the dump truck\n(x2)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI get's off on your face\nYou a swallow it-ass nigga, all of it-ass nigga\nSo I slap it on your face\nYou're a bad wire about to get replaced\nI'm a bad guy about to run up in your face with the .38\nAnd lay you down in the crate just like they used to do back in the day\nI been chopping niggas up ever since Sicx was sacking the yay\nBack in '86, now it's '03 and I'm back in your face\nWith spit's hard like a baseball bat that's cracking your face\nLet me lace your shoelace, I'm 24 Deep and I'm a loose case\nBody parts in the suitcase, make your jaw swell up like a toothache\nTruth hurts, I do work like a state job straight bob, heavy artillery\nFor niggas who ain't feeling me, you niggas be killing me\nMy mouth's like a 9 millimeter, years later still a hit in your Alpine\nSo, it ain't no question about mine, it's about time\nThat I sew this shit up, you must've forgot I know the steps, so I hold heavy metal\nEat them up on every level, heat up your Chevy metal, smash on the pedal\nIt's the 24th Street ghetto, it's The Gardens\nWe niggas retarded, we make your heart split, trust me\nWe started the spit's and trust me we gonna end it by\nMaking your brain tissues rip, spit until you get tendonitis\nI'm burning tires on you niggas careers\nHitman for hire on you niggas lyrics\n[?] and you know I just can't shake it\nLeave you butt-naked, half your body in the refrigerator\n[?] it's Now Eat\nIt's a crowd on the street, it's been a killing, it's bad news\nSomebody give me some penicillin and tell his children [?]\nFrom the bullets, just when you thought we wouldn't pull it\nWe took his money and his pride and everything\nTake his honey and his ride and everything\nIt's all bullshit, sell it\nI spit hard, right straight from the pelvis\nLet you tell it, I'm a nail gun emptying out nail clips\nAnd he'll still let you smell it\nFinally get to release my own shit, nigga\n\n[Hook]\n(x2)", "year": "2003-06-10", "album": "Lynch By Inch: Suicide Note"}], "artist": "Brotha Lynch Hung"}
