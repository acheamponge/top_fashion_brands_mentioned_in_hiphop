Hunned deep at the venue\nHunned keys who I sent to, turn the weed up the mental\nWas in a rental, I done turned down in Pennsylvania\nPistol mania, streets official\n\n[Hook: Kevin Cossom & Vado]\n2 fingers in the air for the ones before\nMiddle finger in the air for the ones that hate\nAin\u2019t no more love\nSorry but it\u2019s gotta be this way\nStackin' all day, trappin' all day\nBack with more yay, we clappin' your way\nI\u2019m a survivor, I\u2019m a rider\nBet you don\u2019t move\nWhen it\u2019s on this side, no\nIt\u2019s been so long but we finally arrived\nWe stackin' all day, trappin' all day\nBack with more yay, we clappin' your way\n\n[Verse 2: Ace Hood]\nYou\u2019re looking at a new school legend\nGift out of Heaven\nPreachin' that real, yeah I'm something like a Reverend\nLivin' by the code, bend nor fold\nBlack man wearin' 100 G's worth of gold\nIced out watches, shirt from Versace\nKing of the south I am, wuddup Gotti?\nBeen speak bout it, money no karate\nProfit go to flippin' now they think I\u2019m Illuminati\nWhat you came here for?
