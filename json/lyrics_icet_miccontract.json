Yeah you could call me that\nInsane? You're on the right track\nBut turn the sounds up\nSo I can stay amped\nDo another crew and break camp\nThe only way I sleep is in a cold sweat\nYou think I'm crazy?\nYou ain't see shit yet\nCause I live to kill and kill for fun\nThe microphone it goes off\nLike a handgun\nIt's goin' down now\nGrab your girl hops\nNo excuses when the bodies\nBegin to drop\nLook in my face fool\nIt look like I'm play'n\nDon't become another\nVictim of mic slayin'\n\nWhat's up?\nYou want your feet in some concrete?\nI got some brothers\nThat'll do you for gold teeth\nBut most the time I move, I move alone\nTake a bat\nBreak your motherfuckin' dome\nShoot you dead in the face\nWith a sawed off\nOne hundred ten degrees\nIce don't get soft\nCause I'm hard as they come\nI come correct\nYou can't handle the vandal hit eject\nIf not you better get\nOut my face sucka\nOr else you better be\nA good bullet ducker\nCause I'm a rip shop\nTell that ass drop\nFive o Ice, yo fuck a damn cop!\nCause I move hard and cold\nWith a gangster stroll\nFive thousand dollar suits\nAnd fly gold\nRolex, you can't fit no more\nDiamonds on it\nPinky ring, worth a house\nIf I decide to pawn it\nWhat's up now punk?\nYo start to choke up?\nYou try to move on the Ice\nYou'll get broke up!\n\nMidnight, time for a homicide\nShowtime, somebody's gonna die\nE hits the switch\nAnd thouands of volts connect\nWith the weapon that's in my fist\nI see a sucka in the third row\nTry'n to riff\nA paragraph and a half he's stiff\nI start bustin' off barrages ear high\nMothers grab for their children\nTears fly\nI'm like a psycho\nWhen the microphone's on\nSpeakers blown, mind gone\nI can't be touched\nOnce my lyrics begin to fly\nSimple stage radiation\nCould make ya die\nYa got a problem nigga?\nYou think your rep's bigger?\nHold your head right there\nWhile I squeeze the trigger\nCause I'm a crazy motherfucker\nThat's no joke\nMy favorite smell is\nThe aroma of gunsmoke\nI'm bustin' off another\nLyrical nightmare\nParents hate the Ice!\nYou think that I care?\nWell I don't give a fuck\nCause I rhyme tough\nDrop science, still bust the ill stuff\nSo now it's time for crime\nAnd the rhyme is mine\nTrack the movement\nHide from the punchline\nI rhyme with quickness\nMicrophone fitness\nThe assassinator\nStay off the shit list", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8ba43671bb57813daf61c8431aebd0ea.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "O.G.
