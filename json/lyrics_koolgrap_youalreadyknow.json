Rap]\nThis where legends get made, claim titles through the edge of a blade\nAfro bro flow, smoother than '70's suede\nNumber one headband, hold an edge, you'se a dead man\nNo wrist IDs, IVs or bed pans\nSword stroke left hand, blood in the red sand\nYou know where I rep the desert lands where the desert blam\nQueens baby working my heavy hands, dudes call him Afro\nGet sliced down from wig piece to asshole\nAnd y'all talk like I'm the one to listen\nI'm on a long mission, dude is gone fishing\nSeven thirty early, you beating the dog fisherman\nI don't chase 'em or replace 'em, I fish 'em in\nI take a rib shot, and walk away whistling\nPlot on tops of the five fam at the christening\nBubble goose, double loop like the Michelin man\nStreets of N.Y.C. to the Michigan, man\n\n[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]\nBoy, you know, you already know, boy, you already know\nBoy, you know, you already know, boy, you already know\nBoy, you know, you already know, boy, you already know\nBoy, you know, you already know, boy, you already know\n\n[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]\nStraight out the woods, where the hoods don't come\nIt's the legend and I'm second to none, son it's better to run\nTry and test before you get to ya gun\nYou gon' leave wit ya head in the trunk\nSho' nuff I'm a beast on the strength, realize\nYou done said ya last words once I reach for the hip\nMan don't even give me reason to flip, it's the season to flip\nYou know the drill, so don't even resist\nThe kid lives wit the blade, one wit the jungle\nCalm and I'm humble, but I said it in the rage\nI'm looking for some getback, getback\nI'm quick to push ya wig back, nigga shouldn't have did that\nNow I'm on your ass like tight pants\nAll across mountain top, deep water and highlands\nSee me, see the Indian dance, for all y'all\nI'm death in the flesh, remember my face\n\n[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]\nBoy, you know, you already know, boy, you already know\nBoy, you know, you already know, boy, you already know\nBoy, you know, you already know, boy, you already know\nBoy, you know, you already know, boy, you already know"}]}
