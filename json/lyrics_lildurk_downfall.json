Lil Durk]\nYou my downfall, I hope you know that shit\nI can't be around y'all, 'cause I can't show you this\nYou gon' do what you gotta do to sell that dog food\nAnd if you got a good bitch, you gotta send her to law school\n'Cause you might need her, tell the feds leave my niggas alone (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nYou my nigga, you my dog, you my dog fa'sho (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nYeah, you my nigga, and you right here for long\nYou my nigga, you my, you my nigga (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Durk]\nYou my nigga, that's a fact, and you can't lie to me (Ayy, woah)\nWhat I get paid on that block, that's like your salary (Uh, woah)\nMandatory rules to the trenches, keep your gun on you\n'Fore the money even be involved, they be one hundred\nFuckin' all these hoes state to state, I ain't see love comin'\nSlow down on that viagra, push from it, uh\nNot what you do, just how you do it, ain't what you say, it's how you say it\nYou can think about the money, but it's how you gonna chase it\nThey freed a couple killers, now they city goin' up\nAnd you only call me when you see me pourin' up\nAnd you snuck n' told, you don't know if we know or not\nAnd you brought me drinks, only time you threw a shot (Wow)\nMy other homie told my other homie\nThat my other homie other homie tryna kill him\nThat's why I only fuck with a couple niggas\nGet out this dope game, get a couple figures\nMake my bitch cum and then I'm cummin' with her\nReal niggas only, ain't no competition\nWe dropped Bloodas, now they sayin' \"Bloodas\"\nIf I don't know nothin', I know our fans love us\nI learn through rappin', get some bands from it\nYou be around the fake, but I'll stand from it\n\n[Chorus: Lil Durk]\nYou my downfall, I hope you know that shit\nI can't be around y'all, 'cause I can't show you this\nYou gon' do what you gotta do to sell that dog food\nAnd if you got a good bitch, you gotta send her to law school\n'Cause you might need her, tell the feds leave my niggas alone (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nYou my nigga, you my dog, you my dog fa'sho (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nYeah, you my nigga, and you right here for long\nYou my nigga, you my, you my nigga (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\n[Verse 2: Young Dolph]\nDon't even fix your mouth to tell me that you loyal (Keep that)\nThey only reason I spare you is because I love you (I swear)\nA whole lot of choppers, couple Jewish lawyers (Yeah)\nStraight dope boy (Yeah), Richard Porter (Trap)\nTook a lot of losses fuckin' with you nigga (Trap)\nSeen a lot of crosses fuckin' with you nigga (Damn)\nYeah, we did dirt (Yeah), yeah, I front you work (Yeah)\nPlugged on the syrup (Yeah), but that shit was curse (Shit!)\nYou like to get high, I like to get paid (Okay)\nI been on some hustlin' shit since 6th grade (Ayy, who dat?)\nI'm the one your mom and daddy told you stay away from\nBut I'm the one who that told you fuck them hoes, let's get this paper\nCount a million, smoke a nigga at the same time (Hey)\nRich nigga, me and you ain't on the same time (it's Dolph)\nOn the stage or in the trap, I'm the same nigga (it's Dolph)\nYou ain't ever elevated, just the same nigga\n\n[Chorus: Lil Durk]\nYou my downfall, I hope you know that shit\nI can't be around y'all, 'cause I can't show you this\nYou gon' do what you gotta do to sell that dog food\nAnd if you got a good bitch, you gotta send her to law school\n'Cause you might need her, tell the feds leave my niggas alone (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nYou my nigga, you my dog, you my dog fa'sho (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nYeah, you my nigga, and you right here for long\nYou my nigga, you my, you my nigga (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Baby]\nYou my nigga, you my dog since the sandbox (Sandbox)\nI been runnin' with some killers, we got hand Glocks (Hand Glocks)\nSippin' syrup, I'm movin' slow like a grandpa (Grandpa)\nKept it real from the jump, these niggas changed up (Changed up)\nAll these diamonds on my neck, they gettin' tangled up\nHearin' rumors 'bout my main man snortin' dust (Oh)\nWe ain't have no ride, we'd steal a car, we don't catch the bus (Yeah)\nI wish Lil Juan could see me now, a nigga rich as fuck (Rich as fuck)\nFuck a nine-to-five, I'm sellin' whole things (Whole things)\nI was down bad on my dick, I didn't have no dreams (No dreams)\nI swear to God I had a hundred racks at eighteen (Ayy)\nSittin' in the cell, goin' hard, they tryna mace me (Serve 10)\nEvery nigga who threw salt gon' have to face me (Face me)\nTold my bitch that she can leave, she won't replace me (Won't replace me)\nDoin' what I'm post to do, I know they hate me (Hate me)\nLet me stand up on they ass until they take me (Take me)\n\n[Chorus: Lil Durk]\nYou my downfall, I hope you know that shit\nI can't be around y'all, 'cause I can't show you this\nYou gon' do what you gotta do to sell that dog food\nAnd if you got a good bitch, you gotta send her to law school\n'Cause you might need her, tell the feds leave my niggas alone (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nYou my nigga, you my dog, you my dog fa'sho (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nYeah, you my nigga, and you right here for long\nYou my nigga, you my, you my nigga (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"}], "artist": "Lil Durk"}
