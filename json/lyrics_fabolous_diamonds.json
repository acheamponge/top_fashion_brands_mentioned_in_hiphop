You can call me the bright man\nSee I dont do Breitlings, I do AP's\nYea I spend G's on all these VV's\nBlowin' on chief, yea I got it from Harlem\n12 carrot pinky ring, shit I got it from Robbin\nStep it up a notch, iced out ski mask\nPlace in the projects to hide my weed stash\nDominican chick, shit I got her from Fab\nYellow stones in my chain so I call it the cab\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Fabolous]\nYo, maybe it's them VV's, cuz' they sets Susters'\nSit on the next bus like that show on MTV\nThe waves on the chain\nMake a nigga fly like the wings on a plane\nWhen you sittin in between 'em\nThey hidden when you clean em', glistenin when you seen 'em\nBeemin' through the tints when I'm sittin in the \"Phenom\"\nOops! I mean Phantom, my words got tangled man\nBut this tiger striped watch'll make ya bitch a Bengals fan\nWe all know Jacob, check the shit he did\nHe spent more time, \"Making The Band\" than Diddy did\nYou feel my campaign, then drop your old spouse\nI'm out in DC, at the \"White and Gold House\" (White and Gold House)...\nWanna convince me love, Secret Service meet with some of that Lewinsky love\nShe saw the chain, gave me brain, no strain ever since\nNow that's what the fuck I call a good \"Chain of Events\"! Nigga\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nDiamonds on my damn chain! It ain't hard to tell!", "title": "Diamonds"}]}
