AKIR.  AKIR, One Enterprises.  Uh.  Come on.  Kunta Kinte.  Yo, yo\n\n[Verse 1: AKIR]\nNotice they try to own us in several ways, and \u2018til\nThe grave, more than physically, we\u2019re locked in a cage.  They want us\nEnslaved.  Respect money, hustle for pay\nStruggle for wage.  Turning the page, suddenly aged\nChristmas all lay away\u2014working your whole day away\nOvertime tomorrow just to borrow so your kids can play today\nHoping that you get a raise for a better place to stay\nWell-fleshed, then you\u2019re home, standing up while dwindling gold\nTwenty-one years old and you roll for your mom\nBeing molded, thinking adult with the moves of\nA grown kid trying to focus though the images are bogus\nFeeling hopeless, scrambling for crumbs like roaches\nTrying to be a player, but nobody coaches\nConsuming with your credit cards, they\u2019ll swarm you like locusts\nThough they show interest, you never know to invest\n\u2018Cause they know the interest\u2019ll lock you deep in the debt\nRewriting checks for the rent is garbage.  Praying direct deposit\nDrop before they stop it.  It adds to your profits\nGhetto Economics\u2014fuck a written promise.  As long as\nNiggas got dollars in his pockets, I\u2019ma keep rocking\nHard to deal between that and my auto-\n-mobile shit.  I wish somebody told me the deal\nNow there\u2019s kids with their bellies to fill.  Better deal with\nBaby moms or the government will.  The plot\u2019s ill\n\n[Hook: AKIR]\nYo, they could care less how the fuck a nigga feel\nI\u2019m struggling with bills\u2014the slavery game is ill\nAccosting, a flossing nigga behind the wheel.  Foul\nCards in the deal\u2014the slavery game is ill (Yeah)\nYanking up the ghetto youth, scramble for their meal, hand-\n-cuffed against will\u2014the slavery game is ill\nHating on each other, my brother, the scene\u2019s real.  Share-\n-cropping in the field\u2014the slavery game is ill\n\n[Verse 2: AKIR]\nYo, yeah, yo\nHustle to buy realty until my pockets filthy\nDime dropped, dime stopped, nigga found guilty\nCall and come and get me.  My plans of living simply\nNow remain history.  Wondering really lynched me\nSlow cats move quickly when it comes to hate\nFighting for bones off his dog plate, he\u2019s upstate\nAsk him, he says, \u201cFuck it.  We\u2019re crabs in a bucket\u201d\nThe darkest women let the lightest men fuck it\nStuck in a syndrome since we rob from our home\nCalling women \u201choes\u201d after the cash, cars, and clothes\nAnd what\u2019s the odds of those who stuck fucking become foes\nFulfilling family roles \u2018til the family close?  Nope\nNot trying to be broke, we\u2019re weed-smoke thugs\nWho bag a bitch and handle shit to handle, hit behind the club\nGovernment projects, bricks built to echo garbage\nLooks like the same place we go to gain knowledge\nThe afterschool centers where niggas grab wallets\nLook like the jail cells, conditioning hidden progress\nGirls on the way to college getting the grease and make\nDollars.  When we come together, all we do is holler\nFar from the same pace, the same race.  Just to save face\nNiggas go get a job for minimum wage\nOn the subway, the elders shake their head at the way\nYoung people still complain, though it\u2019s better today\n\n[Hook: AKIR]\nAyyo, they could care less how the fuck a nigga feel\nI\u2019m struggling with bills\u2014the slavery game is ill\nAccosting, a flossing nigga behind the wheel.  Foul\nCards in the deal\u2014the slavery game is ill (Yeah)\nYanking up the ghetto youth, scramble for their meal, hand-\n-cuffed against will\u2014the slavery game is ill\nHating on each other, my brother, the scene\u2019s real.  Share-\n-cropping in the field\u2014the slavery game is ill\n\n[Verse 3: AKIR]\nYo, yo\nEmcees on the radio spitting their rhymes inspire\nKids to start flipping their minds, saying, \u201cThis is the time\u201d\nMimicking gimmicks \u2018til they\u2019re fitting in stride\nFree shows so they can get it to you live \u2018til you\u2019re feeling the vibe\nGood luck selling it for ten, so cut it to five\nMost people won\u2019t give you the time just to come and rely\nLet alone go in their pocket to give you a dime\nBigger shows, now they\u2019re jocking you to get something you sign\nA&Rs with their contracts and dotted lines\nFrom one block to another, being sold with\nThe other brothers, slave chains on the cover of a\nClassic.  Tragic, the company trashed it\nWondering \u201cwhere\u2019s the cash?\u201d when advanced debt\nWith no assets, indentured service, slave bastards\n\n[Outro: AKIR]\nYeah.  Uh huh (Ahahahahahahahahaha).
