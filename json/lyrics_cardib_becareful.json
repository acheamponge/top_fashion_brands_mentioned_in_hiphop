I guess not though\nIt's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met\nTalk to me crazy and you quick to forget\nYou even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different\nThinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent\nBetween a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt\nIt's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse\nIt all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up\nTeach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck\nFree to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt\n'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self\nYou make me sick, nigga\n\n[Chorus]\nThe only man, baby, I adore\nI gave you everything, what's mine is yours\nI want you to live your life of course\nBut I hope you get what you dyin' for\nBe careful with me, do you know what you doin'?\nWhose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?\nYou gon' gain the whole world\nBut is it worth the girl that you're losin'?\nBe careful with me\nYeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'\nBe careful with me\nYeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it\nBe careful with me"}]}
