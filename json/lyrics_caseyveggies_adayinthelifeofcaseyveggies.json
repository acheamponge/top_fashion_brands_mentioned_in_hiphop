Me Know Tell The Mack Get Back\nShe Was Real Cool Plus Her Ass Was In Tack But Ion't Know My Mind Was So Flat\nSo Piece, All These Girls That I Just Wanted To Get A Piece\nCan't Forget About Llyoda Spanish Chick, Or Puerto Rican\nSo I Guess That Was More Language For The Freakin\nWe Went Out Or Whatever She Was Down, But I Had To Let Her Go\nShe Some What Got Around, Still Flirtin My Heart Had A Condom On\nNever Birth It Yea 8th Grade Had The Chicks At The Back Door\nBut Couldn't Get With Me I don't know Why, The Knob Was Real Slippery\nOh Yea The Breeze, Her Style Was To Hot For The Breeze How We Felt\nAbout Each Other Was Other But I Had To Leave Her For The Other Son\nOf My Mother.....Then A Good Friend Got Me, Met Her At The Party Her Name Was Rocky\nI Was Liking Her A lot For What She Was Not Not Not, Let Me Stop, Like She Stop\nHittin Me Up Ion't Know, Call Me Or Something When You Ready To Go\n\n[ADayInTheLifeOfCaseyVeggies]\n\n[Verse: 1]\nYeah\nLife fades as the sun raise\u00a0\nYour love is like a nice fade and some new J's\nAnd 07 was the year we went to heaven\u00a0\nI didn't expect it, everything just crept in\nMy next sin turn the lights off girl, you my weak spot\nEven though I might talk girl, you just white talk girl\nFreeze the boy then you leave me there, it ain't fair, (I know)\nI still \u00a0got time to go\nI tell my friends all the time aboutcha\nSo I would really be quiet withoutcha\nDo you feel special that this rap is for you\nWhen you hung up on me I wanted to tear you in twos\nWhat am I supposed to do\u00a0\nAll my lies stay true\nLook in your eyes make me blue\nThen they, turn red and I'm all in your head\nWe can sit and watch TV, and lay on my bed\nMy mom will take you home later\nI'm always doing favors cuz I'm loving every flavor\nSweet like a life savor, your a life savor\u00a0\nBecause you changed my thoughts\nThats why when we get the movies yo ticket gets bought\u00a0\nAnd if a nigga try to talk to you, he gon get hawked down I hate that shit\nI would never get in-between another dude and his girl,\u00a0\nSo why all these lame dudes try to ruin my world\u00a0\nHe calling your phone and its making me hurl\nI wanna pick up the phone and say this is my girl, what you need what you want\nAnd I ain't even gon front, you get on my nerves go fly on a bird and go back where you came from, you little lame chump\nBut I'mma chill, I'm just tryna keep it real\nI'm jut tryna give you kisses girl and show you how I feel\u00a0\nIts like me and you running up a steep hill, and if I get tired\nYou keep going and a nigga get fired, I'm on fire when you make me mad\nI'm writing raps realer and I hope it don't get too bad\nI wanna support you in any way no other ever had\nAnd when I blow up with rap, you gon have everything you ever wanted and ever had\u00a0\nAnd just to think a southern girls loving a boy\nBut I dust em right off cuz I'm loving with joy you know\nAnd you ain't never bitter, but you made bad decisions, which then made collisions, to my heart\nFor what it known from the start\nI don't think we would have made it this far\nI woulda saw you differently\u00a0\nBut girl I think you changed so vividly\u00a0\nAnd I respect that\u00a0\nIts like a set trap that got me from behind\nIts not even you face girl its everything inside\nThough everything I think about what you did with them other guys my brain fries\nBut I know I'm you only your main guy\nThat was the past this is now\nLike a smile + a frown and every time I clear my mind its going down\nAnd every time she feel the need to you goin down making me\nFeel like you care, and grabbing your hair\nYou a year older but I really don't care\nYou gave me the same chance thats wat really was fair\nAnd I turned out to be something that really was there\u00a0\nI'm real mature for my age so you thought we would pair, and we did\nWhen we grow up you having my kids\nAnd when I think I \u00a0know you its something I feel in my ribs\nThem I barbecue \u00a0it got me leaving my fears\nI don't act hard, your mama said you shouldn't date a rap star\u00a0thats driving a fast car Well baby I'm better than that\u00a0\nCuz I'm real \u00a0fine mannered and I know how to act\nSo tell mom I'm never leaving and if I do I'm coming right back\nYou was running round them tracks, you was running through my mind\nYou shine\u00a0\nYou make me feel like everything is fine so\u00a0\nWe gon get it together, everything gon be better\nThis is right around the way\u00a0\nAnd other than this song I don't have much to say\u00a0\nSo as long as my shoulder here you got somewhere to lay\nAnd wen we both start driving I wanna see you everyday (ok)\u00a0\nThats as far as I got"}]}
