They might just saw it come'\nWhen the beef is this fresh, plus the night is all young\nYeah, they might be [??] up, yeah, they might be off one\nCatch me slipping, rather take a fucking life like your last one\nThat's a mighty deep perspective, that's a mighty sharp tongue\nYou could be [??] on the beat just like a sharp tongue\nTell your people 'bout it, help your people out\nSeveral people doubt it, I believe in [??] every evil [??]\n\n[Chorus: Arin Ray]\nYeah\nRidin' everyday in the streets with my niggas like\nWe give a fuck about a crooked cop like [??] for them niggas like\nYeah-ah-ah\nWatch out for the one time, for the one time [??]\nGrowing up on this side, nigga, you know how it goes\nThis is how it goes\nThis is how it goes\nThis is how it goes\nThis is how it goes\n\n[Verse 2: King Los]\nYeah, bless that little black boy, life for him's so hard\nTeach him how to paint, write poems, no god\nTeach him how to pray, show him how to ball straight\nHow we're talking positivity and never talk hate\nTake religion as a chance to build relationships with god\nPray for wisdom, make decisions then have patience in heart\nKiss your momma, hug your daddy, give the hood your testimony like I do when I'm  back home and niggas [??] the question from me\nAsk that little black what his little life like\nHelp him out, you could be his little bright light through a dark time\nHard times turned me into man\nWent through failure, but ain't failed 'cause I turned it into a plan\nThere's a wrong path, there's a right path, pick one\nRight path doesn't tend to be a quick one\nSee a black boy, it's my job to help one\nPoppas living here prolly tell me, 'Well done'\nLittle black boy\n\n[Chorus: Arin Ray]\nYeah\nRidin' everyday in the streets with my niggas like\nWe give a fuck about a crooked cop like [??] for them niggas like\nYeah-ah-ah\nWatch out for the one time, for the one time [??]\nGrowing up on this side, nigga, you know how it goes\nThis is how it goes\nThis is how it goes\nThis is how it goes\nThis is how it goes\n\n[Outro: King Los]\nHe said, 'Little black boy ride for his big homie'\nThis little black boy ridin' for a big Rollie\nLittle black boy had it rough, played rougher\nJail was the pattern for his dad along with eight brothers\nHe said, 'Big homie, you the shit. Hope you know that\nAin't where you from, it's what you do when you go back\nI went back, told them they could make it, and meant that\nThe ones that needed shit, that's incarcerated, I sent that\nTook flicks for 'em, I took the advice when life took this for em\nSee little black boys and do good shit for 'em\n'Cause the hood stick to 'em\nTell 'em they could make it and how it could switch for 'em\nSee, little black boy need rules, need guidance\nOr little black boy be a fool, be defiant\nLittle black boy, be cool, be reliant\n'Cause little black bot, you the true sleeping giant\nWake up!"}]}
