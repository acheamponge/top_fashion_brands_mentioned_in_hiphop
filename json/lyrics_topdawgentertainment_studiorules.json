Act like you been around a bunch of rich niggas from the bottom before!\n\n2. If the homies just met you and decide to clown yo bitch azz, sit there and deal with it. It's part of the creative juices\n\n3. Don't touch, ask, or reach for Q's weed, unless he thinks you cool enuff to pass it to you. We only smoke stersonals around here boy\n\n4. Shut up and look ugly for the homies\n\n5. Remember these rules and you might get a meal out the food budget!"}], "artist": "Top Dawg Entertainment"}
