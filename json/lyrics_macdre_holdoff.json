Because everybody's rapping\nThere's too much yapping, running off at the jaw\nWhen your beats ain't slapping and your rhymes ain't raw\nSuper bunkola like a bag of stress\nYou need to sell yola, give the mic a rest\nNigga you ain't fresh, you weak\nYou sound like a broad and you rap off beat\nNigga back off me, tryna get signed up\nYou silly rabbit, you need a good wind up\nLine up with the rest of the chumps\nCut the crap, come back with some slumps\nShip get sunk, kerplunk\nPerp start macking, stop acting drunk\nGet low, punk, get on\nWho told you, you can rap? Hold on\n\n[Hook: Miami the Most]\nHold off\nBecause you soft\nMy ninjas get off\nHold off\nBecause y'all soft\nMy ninjas get off (Hold on)\nHold off\nBecause y'all soft\nMy ninjas get off\nHold off\nBecause y'all soft\n\nDouble, get off\n\n[Verse 2: Richie Rich]\nThe shit that you're spittin' ain't really hittin'\nYou could bail out, have you ever thought to quitting?\nAll these niggas on these compilations\nEverybody rapping all across the nation\nHe used to be a janitor, now he flow\nMy nigga played pro ball, now he flow\nMy nigga dropped out of school, now he flow\nBut that bullshit he rippin' ain't banging at all\nNow 415 was gangster rap\nHalf Thang was gangster rap\nSeasoned Veteran was gangster rap\nPlus The Game was gangster rap\nSo me and Mac Dre come to check The Bay\nPunk, it ain't what you do but what you say\nSixteen bars, can you hold your weight?\nI stole \"Five on It\" and only blew off eight\nNigga, what? Fuck with that\n\n[Hook: Miami the Most]\nHold off\nBecause you soft\nMy ninjas get off\nHold off\nBecause y'all soft\nMy ninjas get off (Hold on)\nHold off\nBecause y'all soft\nMy ninjas get off\nHold off\nBecause y'all soft\nWe never stop\n\n[Verse 3: Mac Dre]\nHold off, MC Never Heard\nAnd you rap like you on crack and a squirter\nDon't deserve a, shot or a chance\nWhen you rap, the people don't dance\nYou's a Gong Show king, you unknown comic\nYou make the mic smell like vomit\nQuit it, will you? (Will ya?)\nYou're your only fan, they just don't feel you\nMildew, rotten, vanished, forgotten\nWhat the fuck is going on?\nWho told you you could rap? Hold on\n\n[Hook 2X: Miami the Most]\nHold off\nBecause you soft\nMy ninjas get off\nHold off\nBecause y'all soft\nMy ninjas get off (Hold on)\nHold off\nBecause y'all soft\nMy ninjas get off\nHold off\nBecause y'all soft\nWe never stop", "year": "2001-11-20", "album": "It\u2019s Not What You Say...It\u2019s How You Say It", "title": "Hold Off"}], "artist": "Mac Dre"}
