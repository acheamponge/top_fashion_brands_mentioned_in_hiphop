Abstract]\nCold morning I wake up on\nSomeone turned they back on me I can feel it\nI know you want something you can turn up to\nBut this still my favorite song\nCause it's a big fuck you to whoever done hated on\nI been drinkin, I been smokin\nNormally I'm sober, this so is not me\nIma blame it on my lover\nIf we was still together\nI probably wouldn\u2019t try to kill myself\nIf you popping off for sure\nKeep your demons near your soul\nA place where I will never go, at least no more\nCause you so protective, keep yourself so bare\nAnd aware, I swear\nMy lord how did we get here\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]\nHide your feelings baby\nYou gon need them 8 keys\nYou gon see them playing\nWe don\u2019t need vacation\nYou gon take this visine\nPretend you was never crying\nWhenever you beside me I feel like dying\n\n[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]\nAnd my goals for our home\nSeem so right but so wrong\nDone postponed from the night\nTo your eyes in this life\nI'll be gone carry on for the sake of my soul\nCause my home will burn, burn, burn, burn\nYa'll bitches really all snakes\nSnakes\nYa'll bitches really all snakes\nSnakes\nYa'll bitches really all snakes\nSnakes\nYa'll bitches really all snakes\nFake\n\n[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]\nReply to me even if you lie to me\nIn my eyes you look like a god to me\nOh my god you feel like a lottery\nIn my Macbook wrote a lotta raps about ya\nOn god, On ma, you mean a lot to me\nCorny as ever with a collard shirt\nWashed my face in the pure dirt\nBefore I showed up on your daddy's porch\nIt was storming and you came out in a skirt\nBig bro love to call me a dork\nYour old man love to curse my name when he see me\nAin't nobody tell him I'mma be on his TV?\nAin't nobody tell him I'mma be like Jeezy, Yeezy, Weezy?\nWheezing, someone in this room better fucking believe me\nYour family want the war, your family want the war\nBringing guns into the church\nTighten my noose in your front lawn\nYou talking shit that make it worse\nYou say you love me yea of course\nYea, yea, yea, yea we all know\nMy pain, my world, my skin, my own\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]\nHide your feelings baby\nYou gon need them 8 keys\nYou gon see them playing\nWe don\u2019t need vacation\nYou gon take this visine\nPretend you was never crying\nWhenever you beside me I feel like dying\n\n[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]\nAnd my goals for our home\nSeem so right but so wrong\nDone postponed from the night\nTo your eyes in this life\nI'll be gone carry on for the sake of my soul\nCause my home will burn, burn, burn, burn\nYa'll bitches really all snakes\nSnakes\nYa'll bitches really all snakes\nSnakes\nYa'll bitches really all snakes\nSnakes\nYa'll bitches really all snakes\nFake\n\n[Verse 3: Matt Champion & Kevin Abstract]\nFell in love with a model (snakes)\nTwo drops in that bottle (fake)\nTwo dollars in wallet\nAt least you got all that Prada\nOh baby Fuck that\nPill the issue, bet it kill you\nSkinny girl, fucked mind, fucked raw, fucking blind\nI don't get it why you act like this\nYou a heartless bitch don't start with me I don't got that shit\nWe grow apart, We losing touch\nI love you bad I hate you good\nI hold you close\nWanna get a little taste right\nNeed your space right\nIn a little tight place right\nWhere we lay and waste right\nYou sex in lace put you on tape\nWanna be last I don't meet your dad\nDo dope, drop out, cop out, no top down\nBut top off, hop on, top no convo pop off\nThe top of that Tahoe thought all I wanted was a model\nI been an asshole, you been a bitch\nI been an asshole, you been a bitch\nBut I hope this last forever baby\nHope this last forever baby\nYea I hope this last forever baby\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Matt Champion]\nHide them feelings baby\nYou gon need them eight keys\nYou gon see them playin\nWe don't need vacation\nYou gon take this visine pretend you never crying\nWhenever I'm inside you I feel like dying\n\n[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]\nAnd my goals for our home\nSeem so right but so wrong\nDone postponed from the night\nTo your eyes in this life\nI'll be gone carry on for the sake of my soul\nCause my home will burn, burn, burn, burn\nYa'll bitches really all snakes\nSnakes\nYa'll bitches really all snakes\nSnakes\nYa'll bitches really all snakes\nSnakes\nYa'll bitches really all snakes\nFake\n\n[Outro: Kevin Abstract]\nAnd I, I, I\nI know when you lie, lie\nAnd I, I, I\nI can feel it when you high, high\nAin't no coming down from this high, high\nYou stuck like this your whole life, life\nFrom the demons to the purple sky, sky\nI'm still that normal guy from the South side\nThe only difference is I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you\nThe only difference is I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you\nThe only difference is I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you\nThe only difference is I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you\nAnd I, I, I\nI know when you lie, lie\nAnd I, I, I\nI can feel it when you high, high"}], "artist": "Kevin Abstract"}
