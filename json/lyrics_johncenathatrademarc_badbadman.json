To the jaw\nYour face is a coat type raw\nAnd the blood and snot they mix, jelly on the floor\nMy love is coppin bricks, belly on the floor\nI'll rob you, you soft and you really ain't a problem\nI'll solve you, 357 long nose revolve you\nAcid in your face, bad look, dissolve you\nI'm a bad, bad man\n\n[Interlude: Bumpy Knuckles/Freddie Foxxx]\nYeah, check it out\nIt's Bumpy Knuckles baby\nAnd I want you to say hello to the BAD, BAD, MAN - C'MON!\n\n[Hook 2X: Bumpy Knuckles]\nWith the mic in my hands I'm a bad man\nEven in a fight with the hands I'm a bad man\nLivin in the streets all my life I'm a bad man\nI'm a bad man, I'm a bad man"}], "artist": "John Cena & Tha Trademarc"}
