I bet you won't say shit\nI went from rags to riches\nI bagged the bitches that gave me the straight face\nI hit the baddest bitches\nIt's sad but I had to curve 'em the same day\nI treated them bad\nI wouldn't be mad if I was to get treated the same way\nSo treat me the same way, same way, same way\nI was a savage to you\nI had to give up and put all my hoes to the side\nI swear if I ever left you in the cold\nIt's 'cause it was colder inside\nLook here, I swear if you ever try to leave me alone\nI hope you don't turn to a thot\nMost of the niggas that call me only hit my phone\nBecause I get money a lot\nI be the one with the throne\nYou say you gon' take it but nigga we know that's a lie\nEven before we was on\nThe money was long and we used to fuck up the spot\nBitches was singing my song\nI knew I was on, right when I bust down a watch\nNiggas was hating before and they hate on me now\nBut don't know what to say to me now\nI was gonna do it to her, but I don't really wanna use her\nKeep giving excuses, when we really gonna link up?\nEven if I sound stupid, I'ma say what's real to her\nEven if she not truthful, fuck it I'ma still be good to you\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, at least I was good to you\nAt least I was good to you\nYeah, at least I was good to you\nAt least I was good to you"}], "artist": "A Boogie Wit da Hoodie"}
