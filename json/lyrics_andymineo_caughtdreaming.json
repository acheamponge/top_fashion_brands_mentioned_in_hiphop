Who's greater?\nWhat love do I have that You didn't give\nCause all that I am is a product of grace\nAnd what should I trust, Your love for me\nOr my love for You? Who's greater?\n\n[Hook: for KING & COUNTRY]\nI'm caught dreaming\nOf someone greater than me\nWho cut the sea\nA burning tree speaking to me\nI'm caught dreaming\nSomeone greater than me\nBringing liberty\nThe blood on Your tree is saving me\nI'm caught dreaming\n\n[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]\nYeah, mouth full of praise, I love you so much\nWhat an empty phrase, really I'm more amazed\nHow in spite of how I fail to do what You command to\nServe other gods like Baal, You never bail\nThat's illogical devotion, could it really be\nYou chose to die for the sinner when nothing was good in me\nYou never left me, even when the darkest days began\nNor forget me, only thing You're forgetting is my sin\nI wanna make it to the end, let me remain faithful\nAll because You're faithful to me, yeah, I'm grateful\nMy mistakes can never stop the choice You make to adopt me\nThe holes in your hands are the proof that You'll never drop me\n\n[Hook: for KING & COUNTRY]\nI'm caught dreaming\nOf someone greater than me\nWho cut the sea\nA burning tree speaking to me\nI'm caught dreaming\nSomeone greater than me\nBringing liberty\nThe blood on Your tree is saving me\nI'm caught dreaming\n\n[Bridge: for KING & COUNTRY]\nI could sing how I love You, love You\nBut Your love for me is much greater\nAnd I could sing how I love You, love You\nBut Your love for me is much greater\n\n[Hook: for KING & COUNTRY]\nI'm caught dreaming\nOf someone greater than me\nWho cut the sea\nA burning tree speaking to me\nI'm caught dreaming\nSomeone greater than me\nBringing liberty\nThe blood on Your tree is saving me\nI'm caught dreaming"}]}
