Girlhood rushed.\u00a0\nOur black boys born kings\nYou try to crucify em\u00a0\nThey built with steel and dreams\u00a0\nWho's the criminal when the global blood is \u00a0on your hands\u00a0\nWe indigenous\u00a0these streets been our land\nYou not supposed to see death\u00a0this early in the morning\u00a0\nIf God is an American, then God\u00a0must be lonely\nMore killed by police in our cities\nThan Afghanistan \u00a0\nThe underestimated. Outliving our circumstance\nSome of us don't dance. Some of us got plans\nWe don't smile for you. But our laugh is hard\nOur new religion includes\u00a0tearing down privatized prison bars\u00a0\nBlack birds fly far. I know who you are\nYour bravado. you a super star.\u00a0\nThe science of Imhotep\u00a0\nWith the heart of 'Pac\u00a0\nWe the ones\u00a0they couldn't kill. \u00a0\nThe chosen. We \u00a0won't stop\nThis is the time for\u00a0hustlers and scholars \u00a0\nSunflowers and gun powder\u00a0\nThe lies just get louder.\u00a0\nShout out to the doubters\u00a0\nShe \u00a0can write surahs and psalms\nIn the same breath cook poems\nAnd write dinner with her left\nRock a mic with her right\nAnd pray her own seeds will be able to\u00a0\nExchange the heavens for a mirror\u00a0\nAnd see themselves as the greatest\u00a0reflection of God", "album": "Church In These Streets", "year": "2015-11-13", "image": "https://images.genius.com/58c3a4511821594b599af9c4311b9430.650x649x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jeezy"}
