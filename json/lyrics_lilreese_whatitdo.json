(Damn)\nWhat it do? What it do? (Smoking that gas)\nHeard that it's a problem, you wanna make the news? (Make the news)\nWhat it do? What it do? (Do)\nChasing all this money, I ain't worried 'bout you\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Reese]\nAye, Fredo what it do?\nI ain't gonna say too much\nBut you know I miss you, fool\nFor you we act a fool\nFor you I pack a tool\nGot that call about you and you know I lost my cool\nSosa miss you too, Caper, all us miss you, fool\nI remember we ain't had shit, fucked up don't know what to do\nEvery time I'm out in Cali, boy I always hit you\nNow I don't know what to do\nNow I don't know what to do\n\n[Chorus: Fredo Santana]\nGot Xanax and lean for the whole damn crew (What?)\nGot a thirty Ruger shot for my motherfuckin' tool (Bang, bang)\nBrand new chopper and that bitch shoot smooth (Grra, grra)\nGot a hundred niggas with me and they all gon' shoot (What?)\nWhat it do?
