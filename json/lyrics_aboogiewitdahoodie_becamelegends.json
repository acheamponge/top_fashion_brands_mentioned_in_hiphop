(ayy)\nSaint Laurent Jeans, Gucci snake up on my collar (ayy)\nSame old things, same fiends in the hallway\n\n[Verse 3: Tee Grizzley]\nBroad day, that's how we comin' out when them dogs play\nLil K, sent her upstate to make sure them dogs straight\nHalf a kilo, ain't talkin' drugs, that's what the charm weigh\nIced my whole wrist like I'm gettin' rid of an arm ache\nWanna book a show?\n20,000, that's the going rate\nLong day, make her kneel before me 'til her jaws ache\nSpit that game to her, tell that bitch, \"I think we soulmates\"\nFly her out, after I fuck her I'ma stay far away\n\n[Verse 4: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]\nYoung nigga in a iced out 3D necklace\nMy pinkie cold, it make me stutter, \"V-V-V-V-S-S\"\nThey try to catch me all alone, but we was deep in Texas\nShe wanted me to be alone, but we go deep wherever\nI saw you lookin' at your phone, I know you see me textin'\nDon't have me blowin' up your phone, just tell me \"Keep it steppin'\"\nIf I run into you again, don't tell me you regret it\nIf I run into you again, you gon' see how I'm flexin'\n\n[Verse 5: Tee Grizzley]\nWhen I was broke, I was neglected\nBitches wasn't textin'\nNow they tryna pop up pregnant, that's to be expected\nI wish I could see the face on all my exes\nLet 'em see the face on a Patek, I used to sleep on pallets\n\n[Verse 6: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie & Tee Grizzley]\nI feel you bro, 'cause me and Sosa was sleepin' on sofas\nNow all the bitches that was frontin', they all on some hoe shit\nBut I could never pay attention to a broke bitch, yeah\nI became a legend, now I need a trophy\nI became a legend off a four minute hit\nNiggas from the trenches, they ain't seen shit like this\nMe and Tee Grizz on some whole other shit, ayy\nMe and Tee Grizz, that's a whole 'nother hit, ayy"}], "artist": "A Boogie Wit da Hoodie"}
