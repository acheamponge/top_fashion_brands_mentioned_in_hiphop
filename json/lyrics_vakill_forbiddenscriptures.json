do\nWrote a verse on the stamp, the man's postal\nMid-coastal vocalist, Vakill the host of this\nGave me a shout, yo Breeze, get in they ass\nLike shit when a baby come out\nFuck rock the cradle, I rock the fatal\nI rock the cape and cop the cable with the stronghold fist piece\nPacked with mo' liquor than an act rap\nNiggas is bitch weak\nSupabreeze, black batman, you can't escape me\nWhat it gonna take me\nWile out and sabotage yo break beats\nSo when your DJ cuts\nHe gets his head blown to the fuck back of his buttcrack\nI cut thats with axe chops\nThe nigga givin' you the finger, standin in the back of your snapshots\nAnd that's not the worst, add on the megahertz\nThrowin' bodies like the high seas crashin the earth\n\n[Camu Tao]\nTwenty-four twelve gauges, pointin' at twelve faces\nShred the ugly mugs to bits and send 'em to hell places\nGimme six seconds, i'll share a sick fetish\nAnd million photos to your walls so you can watch your bitch get it\nIt's Bruce Banner with the screws loose of a loose cannon\nWith a hand grenade and a pistol to introduce panic\nI wanna fuck your whore in the mouth because I hate her guts\nHangin with me in a battle was unlikely\nLike holding anything in your hand like a thousand fucking paper cuts\nI got some sharp shit for your smart ass\nWell son I wet the windshield thru your throw that through your car crash\nAnd I be tugging on you like you making me wanna vomit\nMan you're looking messed up\nLeft your body lookin like welch up from the chest up\nSicker than ten lizards, clawin at ten niggas\nHotter than ten comets and colder than ten blizzards\nCame out of the c-section blocked a and b\nToss anything at me, you still ain't grazin me\nGet so ill it still amazes me\nMy brains a metal case, casin' a metal store and I guarantee\nI'll be up through the mall nigga ready to war\n\n[Jakki]\nYo, you ever hear a nigga scream he wanna battle Jakki?\nYa see that the hold of god of a man that's out of his mind\nI'm bitchin my enemies soft with traps that out of his time\nInchin delivery, pork a rapper out of his spine\nI'll snatch a rapper out his god damn element\nStomp you out with the force of fifty elephants\nI'll take you so far it becomes irrelevant\nShrink myself into your brain and i'll assault your intelligence\nI'm hell sent your little angel, I stunt quickly\nAnd the devil just said, \"You cannot fuck with me!\"\nI'm killin songs, I do it without a rap\nYou can drop a billion bones but won't do it without a strap\nBattlin me you find the words onto deciding factor\nI can reverse your brain and make every word you say come out backwards\nBring the sickest emcee to me to stare in silence\nA hotly sized body it start infecting his iris\nThere ain't nothin that you can do to excite me\nYou slow enough to make a snail look like it's pushing light speed\nMy words are excrement projectiles\nThe shit I talk will make your asshole wanna file divorce and leave your bowels\nYou ain't shit to mine, I cripple spines and split ya lines\nI slow down reality just so you can't rip on time\nLike retinas with feet connectin an ass, I hit behind\nGo ask your mom to take your place nigga that bitch your rhyme\n\n[Copywrite]\nI walk on stage, dick in hand\nOutspit your clan\nI don't like crowds feelin' me no matter how stiff they stand\nCravin Copywrite to spit on a strict diet of fiberglass and bricks\nSo you cats can't bite my shit\nDon't stomp on my crews fame standing on the roof of McDonalds\nThe only way you reach the top of the food chain\nSo what you reachin for the mic for\nI hate my own rhymes, what the fuck makes you think I'mma like yours\nIt's been killin' me how your clique isn't feelin me yet\nFuck a mic check, give 'em a disability check\nX-rated, make songs to stress haters\nFuck an H bomb, I wanna hear some napalm and flex blazin\nI battle fifty weak flow donors\nAnd beat the odds like an abusive freak show owner\nPast foul lifes now identical to my rap style\nTake a shit in a crib and wipe my ass with a bath towel\nStill shittin, still hittin twenty bottles\nSeven henny bottles later, still spittin semi auto\nMy acapella chokes overrated herbs\nRhyme setter sellin dope, so you know I got a way with words\nAnd fuck edit, engineer, let the swears stay\nLike I'm gettin any motherfuckin' airplay\nPure hunger vicious with a track\nUse my little underground fame to lure younger bitches in the sack\n\n[Vakill]\nBet you didn't think it get more vicious when attack\nWhen ink and sword form a syntactical union, send tactical units\nPractice communion, drinkin' the blood of Christ\nAnd then became anemic, I'm amademically\nSpit a chalk outline when I stock up parents swallowers\nPolish my nuts, yo affection is cash\nYou still can't afford to talk outshinin\nYour severed spine drenches on my knife\nMasochist mastubatory, dick riders beat within nine inches of they life\nY'all gay, questioning why I think with my dick so much\nBecause it's the smartest thing to come out of your mouth all day\nTwenty-four bricks when I pen a gram\nI battle the side of a pentagram of a satanical cult cycle while wearin adult diapers\nSo it depends how hard I shit on you and not bitch\nCross your t's and your preparation h's\nI got an extinction agenda in these desperation ages\nFuck up the game so bad that I have to skip payin dues\nAnd go directly into the payin reparation stages\nScathe the pain when it's pen pokin and invokin' the crimson cascade and rain\nAnd the beef is never over until a fat bitch drops a bar like Roseannes maiden name\nIn my universal killables\nCause to shook up to bein' an assassin\nIt's bein ash the first two syllables\nMy genetic makeup is not that abnormal hell\nI'm half lead and when I'm buried in the back of your head\nIs the only way i'll be a shell of my former self, think about it", "album": "The Darkest Cloud", "image":
