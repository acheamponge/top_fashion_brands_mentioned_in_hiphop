I'm like a cowboy\nSix shooter in my hand\nLick shots, reload, and do it again\nRed mist Splattered on my forearm\nAnd fist when ya shootin' this close\nIt's kinda hard to miss\nAt a distance I can't see\nExpressions of victims\nRed liquid limpin' with\nHoles in him ya spillin' somethin'\nPrecious red sand on the cement again\nTill Monoxide chop you with the axe\nAnd then you finished\n\n[Chorus]\nThere are various patterns (fuck)\nTo the blood splatter\nAlthough none really matter (fuck)\n(I'm excited) I'm excited for the red mist)\nTha (red mist)\nLet me see tha (red mist)\nThe afterlife is often without blood mist\nOnly cause it dries to a crisp (I'm excited)\nI'm excited for the (red mist)\nTha (red mist)\nLet me see tha (red mist)(fuck)\n\n[Boondox]\nI keep that hatchet swingin'\nAt yo fuckin' chest I'm aimin'\nWant to see your heart explodin'\nLike a fuckin' hand grenade and\nI want to see your body\nDrain until your life expires\nSpittin' like a volcano\nSpewin' black ash and fire\nWith Blaze and Twiztid bleed\nThese bitches let me testify\nLine em up, sort em out\nWho wanna be the next to die\nI'm quick to make you dead\nA geyser spraying out yo' head\nLookin' like Old Faithful\nBody twitchin' in a pool of red\n\n[Chorus]\nWarm blood spray (fuck)\nRed mist gently flowin' in the creek (fuck)\n(I'm excited) I'm excited for the (red mist)\nTha (red mist) Let me see the (red mist)\n[Hope you got yo hatchet with you\nSwing'em (low)\nSwing'em (high) 3x]\nTha' (red mist)\nLet me see the (red mist)\n[Hope you got yo hatchet with you\nSwing'em (low)\nSwing'em (high) 3x]\nTha' (red mist)\nLet me see the (red mist)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9bc5140eadd19250a34c88748f1ddafa.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
