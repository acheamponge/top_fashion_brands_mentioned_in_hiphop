Cancel that\nI booked a flight, let's go and catch a tan\nI'll take you out to Hakkasan\nYou've had a couple boyfriends but never had a man\nI'll catch him at a traffic jam\nRed Light, Amsterdam, if he tries to disrespect\nBut fuck them, man, let's blow a bag on Chanel and get all them niggas vexed\nOn some different flow, acting like you didn't know\nA nigga so Gary Coleman, I got them different strokes\nYou throw it back and now I'm matching your rhythm in missionary\nI'm a man on a mission to make your legs shake\nTo make you feel it in your stomach and your chest plate\nUntil the next day you give me head until your head aches\nI heard a saying, you get it fast, it never lasts\nForget pain, there's no club inside of a deck of cards\nYou gave your heart to a joker, now you can try a king\nYou play it close to the chest, you've got a checkered past\nAnd a purple heart, wow, you've got a purple heart\nYou think my work is art and I think you're a work of art\nAsked her, \"Can you do it like the last time?\"\nShe said, \"I can, sir, and I ain't talkin' 'bout the star sign\"\n\n[Outro]\nI guess it's important that you have someone you can trust\nEspecially in the position you're in, and um...\nI think it's a really good trait that you're able to find positives\nDespite some of the challenges, for want of a better word, that you face", "year": "2019-03-08"}], "artist": "Dave"}
