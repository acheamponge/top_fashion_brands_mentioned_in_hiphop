These enchanted creatures dwell in the\nDepth of the sea, occasionally doffing their seal skins to pass\nOn land as mortal men. Legend has it that they then accept human\nPartners, and some families on the islands actually trace their\nAncestry to such marriages. In more complete versions of the\nBallad, the Silkie's forecast of the death of himself and his son\nEventually come to pass. The tune is by Dr. James Waters of\nColumbia University. From \"British Ballads and Folk Songs from\nThe Joan Baez Songbook. \"\n@myth @ballad @love @animal\nSee also silkie2\nFilename[ silkie1\nDc\n===Document boundary", "title": "Alaska", "year": null, "album": null}], "artist": "Unknown Artist"}
