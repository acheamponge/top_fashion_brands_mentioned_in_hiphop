Asiatic non-equivalent to any\nPlus I play the game a more harder way than Penny\nThe plan that I mobilize for dough to rise is no surprise\nThat it comes from what I vocalize\nI'm the best you can get as I hit you with\nThe stroke of death, and I ain't even broke a sweat\nBut this is where I draw the line, you're sure to find\nLyrics I be dropping is too much for the mortal mind\nWhat's being caused is many emcees I'm seeing lost\nThe hip hop laws should be reinforced\nYou made a record this year, oh you're hot?\nSomething fishy about your style, who flow you got?\nYou thought that you could hold me down? No, you're not\nNow back up off me, here I come to blow the spot\n\n[Hook: Kelly German]\nKeep it moving, world renown\nShowing and proving, that we can hold it down\nKeep it moving, world renown\nShowing and proving, that we can hold it down\n\n[Verse 3: Big Daddy Kane]\nAlright, here I come to get some\nBut instead, you don't want the love to spread\nI heard that jealousy and envy is a dumb one's tool\nSo Daddy says nothing, he keeps his cool\nI been through your tribulations and conflicts\nAnything possible to keep me out the mix\nBut ease back, boy you better freeze that\nWhere my rivalries lack, I'm still nice with these Black\nI rap with the safety cap so that you don't get it twisted\nAnd be another statistic\nHow many more to try is sure to die\nSlaughter I, all that playa-hating only makes me fortify\nTo get the papers to me is a necessity\nAnd I don't want a piece of the pie, I want the recipe\nI can't lose with what I use\nI'm the reason why the lady sings the blues, don't get it confused\n\n[Hook: Kelly German]\nKeep it moving, world renown\nShowing and proving, that we can hold it down\nKeep it moving, world renown\nShowing and proving, that we can hold it down\n\n[Outro: Big Daddy Kane]\nHold it down, baby, hold it down\nHold it down, baby, hold it down\nHold it down, baby, hold it down\nUh, uh, uh, uh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/55a075f6632f5b5a223681bd3f7a7ca8.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "1998-04-28", "title": "Hold it Down", "album": "Veteranz Day"}]}
