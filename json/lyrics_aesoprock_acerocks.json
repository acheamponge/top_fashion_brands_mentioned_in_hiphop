Add \u2018em up\nCrypt, Jest, Wind, Vast, Vor, Cip, Alaska\nEye at his worm chopper\nFingers on the fader\nAnd he\u2019s faded if the fingers made the dutch burn proper\nI let 'em crowd the new record the fuck up for the sensors\nYou don\u2019t know what you forgot, you\u2019ll remember in September\nIt\u2019s gonna make these little style-biting Fraggles lasso they dentures\nLearning innovation mixed with inherent respect for mentors\nThe antiplane buffing or stuffing throwies down your throat\nCan ya feel it? That\u2019s rough rugged raw\nFuck a sealed kiss\nFee fie fo fum smell the dummy tears\nI\u2019m ghost, Cip take us the fuck up outta here\n\nOutro:\n\"We stand in the shadow\u2026is our God.\" (scratched)", "title": "Ace Rocks", "album": "B-Sides & Rarities Vol. 2: 2003-2006", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a5b6afc49584a42f7d4864df63e494f6.310x320x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
