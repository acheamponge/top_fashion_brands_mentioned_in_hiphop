Here we are\n\n[Verse 1]\n(Momma, I made it)\nYou know how I do it like The DOC do it, I fly through it\nThat's how I operate, (momma, I made it)\nGhetto like the grease when you getting ya hair braided\nSweeter than ya sister Kool-Aid is\nHooray!! It's the underdog now my feet\nOn the desk I'm the Presidential favorite\nCan't believe I got away with\nMy earliest stages to being on stages\nHaving my way with the world, congratulations!!\nYour baby boy's a made man I'm a hold the fam down like three generations\nI'm talking when spaceships are around and ya great-great grands\nReminiscing bout the foundation you gave em\nFor repairing my relationship with my pops before he passed\nAll I ask is you raise your glass in this celebration\nToast to the most beautiful girl in the world\nMy inspiration thanks for the information\n\n[Chorus]\nMomma I made it... momma I made it\n\n[Verse 2]\nOut in BK where\nIt ain't everyday that you make it out\nBe on top of yachts waving\nI remember you saving for the light bill, paid the rent with the light bill\nNow our crib dark as a basement\nHad to lock up the phone when you wasn't home\nWe was communicating like the money you made wasn't basic\nOur cable was basic no HBO, WHT, just Ralph McDaniels on the station\nI aggravated you for Atari and ColecoVision pinstripe Lee's\nWhen the first day of school came in\nI was okay with not having everything\nLong as Saturdays you had the Commodores playing\nThe expression on your face was priceless\nStill with me till this day baby girl I won't erase it\nI go to my grave with the memory of the sacrifice you made\nYou deserve a standing ovation\n\n[Chorus]\nMomma I made it... momma I made it\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow your lil misfit make sure every day is Christmas, write out your wish list\n6's, wrist is glistening you don't even like jewels\nBut you could get missing anywhere you like to\nWhere the waters light blue, anything you order\nSign it to your nice room leave a extra tip, ma\nBe extra nice to 'em\nCEO of Carter Foundation, wow!\nI know pop looking down\nI know Colleek somewhere up in the clouds like\nGo get 'em Grandma make me proud\nDidn't have a man in the house so you made one\nSo I act like your husband and I'm only your son\nI told you one day I'd get you a home\nI didn't know it could possibly be in Rome\nTold me don't wait on nobody, get your own\nSo with me myself and my microphone, I made it\n\n[Chorus]\nMomma I made it... momma I made it", "title": "I Made It", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4371d45b1c52d7dc87e4204ae0aa8373.900x900x1.jpg", "year": "2006-11-21", "album": "Kingdom Come"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
