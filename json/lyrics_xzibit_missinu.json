Neva\nDown right angry sometimes that we ain't here together\nYou can feel your roots and see how strong we are\nWho would've thought we could get this far, damn I miss you\n\n(Chorus: Andre Wilson)\nEven though I know it's been tough\nI can't stress enough no matter what - mama I love you\nYou've always been there by my side\nYou've taught the wrong from the right - mama I love you\n\n(Verse 2)\nYesterday was you fifty-ninth birthday\nTime flew missing you in the worst way\nI still feel the same pain since the first day\nYou left through death on God's request\nI can't complain through the year's mama I've been stressed\nThrough them bullets and the bad times I've been blessed\nFor the times that I fail but I tried my best\nAble to do for my loved one's, real success\nYour the source of my strength I was blessed with your gifts\nYour insights, your wisdom, your penmanship\nFun n games, I'm doing thangs, I know you wouldn't agree with\nWhat I drink, what I smoke, who I be with\nYou made sure I got some love when there wasn't none\nOpened up my heart showed the world where I'm coming from\nYour little grandson is just like your little boy\nMama what you built here no man can ever destroy, your bundle of joy\nI've been through so much\nI lose touch and sometimes I feel that life sucks\nMy women try to get close I push here away\nShe wanna talk I just sit there with nothing to say\nFeel me its all the pain I contain on the inside\nYou in the right place but left me at the wrong time\nUse to cook, clean, and sing me to sleep\nNow I only go to bed with my heat, damn I miss you\n\n(Chorus)\n\n(Verse 3)\nThe school of hard knocks where I learned life's lessons\nWith not enough answers and too many questions\nWhen you had me you gave birth to a soldier\nNow I'm much older now the world much colder\nOur lives in the hands of politicians that don't care\nWe ponds in the game biological warfare\nThe family's so spread out n disconnected\nTrying to hold things together put my soul on records\nIt's hard; you know your daughter had a baby too\nA beautiful baby girl just another little piece of you\nAnother branch we can add to the family tree\nResponsibility bringing out the man in me\nYou ain't a man if your not taking care of home\nRaise and protect my own, until they full-grown\nNo matter how much these streets try to change me\nI'm never 'gon forget how you raised me\nI Love You, Forever\n\n(Chorus)\n\n(Ad Libs)\nYeah, all the mothers, all the daughters, yeah, come on\nSun, Moon, Earth, yeah, this for you, uh, Damn, Damn I Miss You"}], "artist": "Xzibit"}
