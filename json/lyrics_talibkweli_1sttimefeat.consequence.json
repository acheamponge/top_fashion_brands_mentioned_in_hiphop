Consequence)", "lyrics": "[Hook: Consequence]\nThere\u2019s a first time for everything\nThere\u2019s a first time for everything\nBut don\u2019t be afraid of what\u2019s in the dark\nJust open your eyes and see what\u2019s in they heart\nI remember the first time I left it up to you\nBut I learned from the first time to never trust in you\n\n[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]\nAy yo, the first time ever I saw your face\nI recall the case\nCut the grass now I see all the snakes\nMy lawyer man cake\nCause of you he\u2019s been employed by the beef\nAnd now it\u2019s time to half court in the street\nFalling asleep on your boy is not recommended\nHe felt the weapon in your chest because I\u2019m well respected\nSo when you disrespect reflection then your health effected\nI go harder than any demon that hell invented\nI never felt threatened\nBy none of these industry motherfuckers\nCause they smucks and they blood suckers\nYou can come quicker than sideways or backwards\nI always come straight up in your face\nYour mistake is confusing me with a rapper\nThat interviews and a fashion\nYou assuming I\u2019m passive\nI\u2019m really truly a master\nOf lyrically moving masses\nIt\u2019s true but if you attack us\nI\u2019m never the one to back off\nNever the one to slack off\nI\u2019m making them take the mask off\nIt\u2019s beautiful when I black out, it\u2019s natural like disasters\nMy body is like a host for a ghost of the middle passage\nYou not imagining the noise you hear is laughter\nThey giggle behind your back you enacted your family matters\nYou read into what\u2019s happening and kill it like an assassin\nLooking for that applause when all you get is the clappin\u2019\nI\u2019m serious about my craft don\u2019t ever confuse the masses\nBy taking my outtakes and trying to repackage them\nIt\u2019s never forgive action\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Consequence]\nYou only get one chance to make a first impression\nThat\u2019s why I always make sure I come the freshest\nWhether I start or my words ending\nI\u2019m here to exercise my first amendment\nWhich gives you the right to get your verse played\nI almost lost that after the third grade\nCause on the first and fifteen before I stayed\nMy team was the first to get paid\nSo why would you cross us in the first place\nUnless you willing to catch a first case\nYou better all go on on your first date\nTo see if you can get past first base\nThis the first taste of what the pain gave me\nYou listen to the rumors you would think they played me\nBut they my juniors, my first babies\nI only deal with presidents like the first lady\nWho pay me on a first name basis\nI don\u2019t like you niggas I\u2019m almost racist\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m cursing the first person or cursing the first person who didn\u2019t make my first purchase\nBut type my name in they word searches\nCause I kill the flow bring out the first hearses\nAnd this will be the first crime you ever seen\nBut it\u2019s cool cause there\u2019s a first time for everything\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]\nBefore the ink dried and the deal was finalized\nAnd the money changed hands and the plan was monetized\nWe used to eat mcdonalds fries\nShop for economy size\nKnow when economists lie\nWe poor we trying to survive\nAnother stat-istic of a man with some kind of pride\nI\u2019m getting black listed like I\u2019ve got a communist tie\nLittle did I know it was myself I was trying to find\nGetting all kind of high\nCrashing like vehicular homicide\nBut now I\u2019m self employed and I\u2019m chilling\nI\u2019m waking up with the millionaires\nYou looking for the building I\u2019m still in there\nStill in fear\nScared of the dark that don\u2019t matter\nWhen the lights come on the cockroaches scatter\nExposing the data\nYo get a load of these actors\nThey cloak and dagger\nSee how I broke they swagger\nMy spirit is rich\nYea the lyrics is sick\nGet prepared lyricist of the year in this bitch\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
