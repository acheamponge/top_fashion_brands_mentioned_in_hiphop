Indian people\nWho owns our shit?\nSo we shake our arse and dance\nAs if racism just upped and vanished\nBut has it? No its right on course\nYou\u2019re beaten so bad, you\u2019re trained to ignore\nLet me not just make sweeping statements\nGimme a second, I\u2019ll explain it\nFor small amounts of drug possession there\u2019s more black people in jail in America than there is for rape and armed robbery and murder all put together\nYou can say they\u2019re just locking up thugs\nImagine if they locked up every middle class kid that had ever held drugs\nOh that\u2019s right, that\u2019d be your kids!\nBigger than that what is going on with this\nPrison in America\u2019s a private business\nThey get paid fifty-k per year per inmate by the State, just wait\u2026\nAlso legally are allowed to use their prison inmates as slaves\nCheap slave labour, big corporations\nThey come out of jail, can\u2019t get a job\nSo when we celebrate going to jail\nWe are literally celebrating enslavement\nAdd to that, that the hood that you\u2019re livin\u2019\nEngineered social condition that breeds crime by design\nWhere do you think you get your nine?\nYou can say that they\u2019re just black\nBut I like to deal with facts\nIn the 1920s you would\u2019ve found in America\nBlack Towns\nProspering centres of economics and education to make you proud\nBut some people couldn\u2019t bear that the former slaves would not just lie down\nSo the KKK and other hate groups burnt those towns to the ground\nKillin hundreds\nIf it ain\u2019t understood\nYou think you were always livin\u2019 in the hood?\nShit it\u2019s only been sixty years\nSince they hung blacks and burned em\u2019\nAnd that was so cool\nThey were your pastors' picnic baskets\nEven gave kids the day off school\nTo go see a lynching; have a picnic\nIt\u2019s fun to watch the little monkeys die\nThen people act a little dysfunctional\nYou wanna pretend that you don\u2019t know why\nIf your colour means you can be killed\nAnd you\u2019re powerless to get justice about it\nIs it difficult to figure out how you would then end up feelin\u2019 about it?\nAnd that ain\u2019t excuses\nJust dealing with the roots of abuses that make a reality\nWhere a generation of young men speak of ourselves as dirt casually\nThat\u2019s America\nThis Britain\nSome things are similar\nSome different\nIn this country the first enslaved were the working class\nWhat\u2019s changed?\nWorst jobs, worst conditions\nWorst taxed, look where you\u2019re livin\u2019\nYou go to the pub, Friday night\nYou will fight with a guy, don\u2019t know what for\nBut won\u2019t fight with a guy, suit and a tie\nWho sends your kids to die in a war\nThey don\u2019t send the kids of the rich or politicians\nIt\u2019s your kids, the poor British\nThat they send to go die in a foreign land\nFor these wars you don\u2019t understand\nYeah they say that you\u2019re British\nAnd that lovely patriotism they feed ya'\nBut in reality, you have more in common with immigrants\nThan with your leaders\nI know, both side of my family\nBlack and white are fed ghetto mentality\nReality in this system\nPoor people are dirt regardless of shade\nBut with that said\nLet\u2019s not pretend that everything is the same\nWhen our grandparents came here to Britain\nIf you had a criminal record you couldn\u2019t get in\nYet that ain\u2019t protect them from all the stupid, stupid abuses they would be livin\u2019\nKicked in the teeth, stabbed in the street\nMany times fired bombed our houses\nPut faeces through our letterbox\nAnd of course the cops did so much about it\nDaily, up to the eighties\nPeople spittin\u2019 into my pram cos\u2019 I was a coon baby\nBut of course, that has had no effect on why today we are crazy\nAnd none of this was for any good reason\nThey were just dark and breathing\nTo ease the guilt now for all of this treatment\nConstant stereotypes are needed\nSo if I celebrate how big that my dick is, bricks that I\u2019m flippin\u2019\nClips that I\u2019m stickin\u2019, chicks that I\u2019m hittin\u2019, I\u2019m playing my position\nBut if I teach a kid to be a mathematician, messin\u2019 with the schism\nHow they gonna fill a prison when materialism is nothing but a religion?\nWhat do you think we got now in Britain?\nJust like America, private prisons\nPrisons for profit!\nThat mean when your kids go jail people make money off it\nSo keep environments that breed crime\nBuild more jails at the same time\nMarket badness to the kids in the rhymes\nAs long as rich kids ain\u2019t dying, it's fine!\nGet em\u2019 to the point where some are so lost\nThey actually believe that if they don\u2019t celebrate killin\u2019 themselves off\nThat it\u2019s because they\u2019re soft\nWas Malcolm soft? Was Marley soft?\nTell me was Marcus Garvey soft?\nWell? Was Mohammed Ali soft? Nah, Nah I think not!\nBut they want us to think that the road is cool\nBeing on road is all we can do\nWe don\u2019t control the wholesale productions\nWho benefits from us movin\u2019 the food?\nOr thinking there\u2019s no way out of road life\nBut Malcolm X used to hustle out on the roadside\nWhen Marcus Garvey organised more than six million people\nWith no Facebook or Twitter\nWhy is this something you cannot equal?\nShit!\nOne of my homeboys did a ten straight in the box in yard\nNow, what\u2019s he doing? Passin\u2019 his doctorate\nDon\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s too hard!\nWho trained you to believe that you\u2019re inferior?\nSungbo Eredo in Nigeria are the remains of an ancient moat\nDug one-thousand years ago\nTwenty metres wide, seventy down\nRound the remains of an ancient town\nThat\u2019s four-hundred square miles around\nFour-hundred square miles around\nPlease, please don\u2019t believe me\nIt was a documentary on BBC\nBut we ain\u2019t studyin\u2019 history\nToo busy watching MTV\nAnd MTV said wear platinum\nNow everybody wanna go and wear platinum\nAnd MTV said pop magnums\nNow everybody wanna go and pop magnums\nIf MTV said drink prune juice\nYou would start hearing that in tunes soon\n\"Hey!
