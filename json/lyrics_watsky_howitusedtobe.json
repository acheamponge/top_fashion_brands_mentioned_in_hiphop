Like way back, like mad long\nThat President Riff-Raff used to write rap songs?\nAnd I heard the people lit nicotine\nBut they weren\u2019t allowed their sweet, sweet sticky green\nAnd they let a kid be shipped to Iraq\nBut they wouldn\u2019t let him sip on a whiskey when he was back!\"\n\nYep, that\u2019s back when life was a terminal illness\nBefore that doctors learned that we came\nWith a little switch every person turned in their brains\nWhen life was overwhelming and so we turned from the pain\nBack when slums grew in the shadows\nOf a 170 story chateaus\nAnd the people under \u2018em fought\nFor the crumbs that fell from the windows up at the top\nWe claimed freedom but our elections were bought\nBy a high-spitting executive, not a second of thought\nBack when corporations were people but people weren\u2019t even people\nAnd people just weren\u2019t connecting the dots\n\n[Chorus]\nTell me how it used to be\nCause we\u2019ve come so far\nTell me how it used to be\nTell me how it used to\nHow it used to\nHow it used to be\n\n[Watsky]\nPeople would hate you over what spirit you prayed to\nYou talk and they wouldn\u2019t hear it\nThey fear it and decapitate you\nAnd back in the states all we\u2019re doing is just always say that they're doing\nPlacing humans in boxes over what appearance they're near to\n\n[Adam Vida]\nI fill in boxes, they said inside of it was a future\nThey bomb a school full of students and do away the computers\nTechnology, we can use it on mother earth to improve her\nInstead we steady abuse her but was it worth the maneuver?\n\n[Watsky]\nWho are we kidding? You and me didn\u2019t ruin the system\nBut soon the kids who crawled out of the sewers grew to be different\n\n[Adam Vida]\nBrutally killing for power\u2019s not our true intuition\nSo we flip the script now we living with the newest traditions\n\n[Watsky]\nSmashing the walls and dancing and drinking\nWine in the kitchen\n\n[Adam Vida]\nKissing and hugging and laughing\nFuck it we shining and winning\n\n[Watsky]\nWomen and men looking back and telling\n\n[Adam Vida]\nReminding the children of how it\n\n\n[Watsky]\nHow it\n\u00a0\n[Adam Vida]\nHow it\n\n\nHow it\n\u00a0\nHow it\n\n\nHow it\n\u00a0\nHow it\n\n\nHow it\n\u00a0\nHow it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1aacc5c51f6e3a30a154e12a7fc3100f.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Oops!
