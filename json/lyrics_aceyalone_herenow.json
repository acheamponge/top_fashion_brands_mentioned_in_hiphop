I say with my style\nOne of the few things I got in this world\nMy family and couple of friends, my beautiful baby girl\nAnd procrastination, lack of motivation in your operation\nI'm sorry, but I just don't have the patience, you'll never get\nA second chance to dance, while you sit on your hands\nWe spit out the jazz for the fans, I'm soo far advanced\nI had to bring it back sum, and I said fuck it\nLet's take it to the maximum, like walking with ya legs broken\nMic smokin' arms, dragon, staggering and laughing here and now\nI don't cry later, I put it down now, I don't wanna try later\nI seize the time with ease from behind\nI freeze-frame the game for the grind, I came for your mind\nNot for the fame with the deaf, dumb and blind\nCause everybody's gonna get just what come to 'em\nFind your guide and run to 'em\n\n[Verse 3]\n\"real shit\"\n\nI wanna talk now, no you can't call me back\nYou're too anxious, yeah you can call me that\nI wanna eat now, cause there's the food right there\nNo I can't wait, I just want my fair share\nSo where the fool that call all the shots at?\nPatience is a virtue, yeah man I got that\nBut my clock reads half past the monkey's ass\nAnd a quarter to his balls and it's moving fast\nI just wish some people wouldn't dick around\nCause I wanna hear it now, I can't stick around\nSo I probably won't be in the lobby\nWaiting for bobby to give me a jobby jobby\nAceimo, primo, Kimosabi, knees knobby\nBut stand firm not wobbly, so where we at\nRight here where time is at now, motherfuck the date\nMotherfuck the trial", "title": "Here & Now", "album": "Magnificent City", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d377dd352876664b03799298f4325e48.600x600x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
