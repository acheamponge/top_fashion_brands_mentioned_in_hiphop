I'm workin!\nNow have that pasta cooked when a real nigga done\nHoe bitch! I'm workin!\nI got my money up and bought twenty more guns\nAye bitch! I'm workin!\nRealest nigga in the game. Let me show you how it's done\nAye bitch! I'm workin!\nAye you niggas ain't trappin. Nigga you livin with yo mom\n\n[Verse 1]\nI tried to make a fuckin song for the radio\nThat's when I realized I'm a real trap nigga\nI swear that choppa knock a nigga off his patio\nMeet me at Trader Joes. Thirty for a whole chicken\nI got these hoes astonished\nAll these yellow diamonds\nChoppas like a shotta\nNiggas try to rob it\nCatch another body\nLarry, do you trap?\nI don't know. Probably\nBitch you're out of pocket\nAre you off a molly?\nSuper duper trappin\nRolly cost a Caddy\nAskin all these questions\nLarry, are you mobbin?\nNiggas got a problem\nAll my niggas slidin\nWhen I'm out in Houston, gotta keep the rocket\nDamn I just hit a fuckin pot hole\nAye! Scraped up my fuckin Forgi-atos\nYou hear that beepin? That's the money counter\nI'm on a mission. I've been moving faster\nThroughout the pain. Nigga never panic\nTwo hundred thousand. Kept it in the attic\n\n[Hook]\nAye bitch! I'm workin!\nNow have that pasta cooked when a real nigga done\nHoe bitch! I'm workin!\nI got my money up and bought twenty more guns\nAye bitch! I'm workin!\nRealest nigga in the game. Let me show you how it's done\nAye bitch! I'm workin!\nAye you niggas ain't trappin. Nigga you livin with yo mom\n\n[Verse 2]\nAye! Lately I've been on some other shit\nI need a million bags\nCatch a nigga slippin. Four-Five hit a nigga legs\nLately I've been spazzin\nI done ran through bout fifty bands\nNow it's time to re-up\nHit my plug I need bout fifty bags\nI pray to God I never have to trap again. Our block Hot\nTwo weeks ago the feds ran in my nigga's spot\nYou'll probably never comprehend the shit a nigga rappin bout\nBend the corner, mob, if I see the fuckin white ghost\nDammit I've been fuckin ballin daily\nMy conversation paper. Dig it, baby?\nBefore I hit, she signed an application\nI got bitches. All fuckin races\nWater whippin like a life guard\nPunk bitch I got no patience\nThese rap niggas all swag takin\nI'm buyin new whips. New registration\n\n[Hook]\nAye bitch! I'm workin!\nNow have that pasta cooked when a real nigga done\nHoe bitch! I'm workin!\nI got my money up and bought twenty more guns\nAye bitch! I'm workin!\nRealest nigga in the game. Let me show you how it's done\nAye bitch! I'm workin!\nAye you niggas ain't trappin. Nigga you livin with yo mom"}], "artist": "Larry June"}
