My nigga spanky got a hell of a beam\nSince 88' hes been a dream to fiends\nFrom state to state I gotta sling these tapes\nCDs to make so women masterbate\nEducated niggas with ghetto fame\nFamous for splittin up niggas brains\nYou reap what you sew when it comes to the game\nSwift to the fifth and now you have no name\nSince 88' dope is escalate\nNiggas out-run cops that's over-weight\nThe 1st and 15th are sacred days\nMoney and hoes flipped are different ways\nWeed is smoked at an alarmin rate\nPrepare for an attitude at the start of the gate\nMan... My minds on the money and my brain can't escape\nSo just like cakes man, I'm a sling these tapes\n\nSince 88' man, there's been a race\nEars, they open wide when game is laced\nMan... This sexy hoe, she got a hell of a face\nSo I'm a use her to fly tapes across the state\nPrices dropped and they rise like yeast\nNo shows'll have a nigga mad for weeks\nMan... My girl just quit me and I loved that freak\nSo frustration fucks is what I have in the sheets\nCrime and murder has escalate\nFun and love has just turned to hate\nGin is in and niggas drink it raw\nWatch for the task cause niggas break the law\nDon't look for trust because it don't exist\nYou talk too much to that nasty bitch\nMan... She told your plan to a hell of a dick\nHe told his click, now for a minute they rich\nSince 88' I been slingin tapes\nLike keys from Cuba or the Miami state\nTriple beam it up and see how much I'm a make\nIt's been this way man since 88'\n\nMotherfuckas drive cars that alert the law\nFinest things that you've ever saw\nMake a bitch suck dick and come up outta that bra\nFound out she was cheatin, damn near broke her jaw\nMasterminds... They got skeems for cream\nTryin to live that American Dream\nMost niggas die over bitches and greed\nFuck the rest of this song I'm bout to smoke my weed"}]}
