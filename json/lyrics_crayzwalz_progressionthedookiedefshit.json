DJ Noise.  Exclusive.  C-Rayz Walz.  C-Rayz Walz.  C-Rayz Walz.  The Sun Cycle.  What up, Denmark?\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nI smack kids with rap tactics by the casket\nBury you backwards\u2014you\u2019ll be ass out, faggot\nI\u2019m cold as ice.  Hot like your moms when she page me\nI\u2019m a fire sign\u2014how you gonna blaze C?\nYou look like a pussy\u2014I should call you fuckface\nYou couldn\u2019t dodge my punchlines if you had duct tape\nLike drugs, all I\u2019mma do is fuck you up\nYou\u2019re shit\u2019s not that hot, kid.  Bless you, but\nI\u2019mma give you a facelift and beat your ass\nTo make you walk through Brownsville with a Bill Clinton mask\nBut you a bullshit character in BC form\nTake your eyes out, put \u2018em on my porch\u2014see what I be on\nPeon, I\u2019ve been doing this shit for eons\nBut money don\u2019t change nothing, right?  Ask Dion\nCops be watching me like Blank Panthers in the neon\nLocked out my house for moving keys wrong (Stupid)\nYou can\u2019t catch me, so don\u2019t test me\nI\u2019m the gingerbread MC who fled with jet skis\nLet\u2019s get free before you rock ice like Gretsky\nImpress me, blaze trees on an Express D\nBy kicking a freestyle and catching a scratchie\nThe mic\u2019s a dookie rope chain yelling, \u201cSnatch me!  Snatch me!\u201d\nI pad Maxis, do math in bad taxis\nSmash Fat Beats through my path like Mad Max feet\nMy style\u2019s water\u2014I Spring Poland.  Keep talking\nI punch you in the throat.  You can\u2019t cope\u2014you\u2019ll speak swollen\nYou got flames, you got game, but seem butt enough\nTo be bitch slapped by Xena\nAnd you could cream Puff like Sean Combs\u2019 bank accounts\nBut I seen enough shit in this rap to make me bounce (What?)\nReminisce of clear, crisp but hear this basic flow\nI put holes in the game just to lace it, yo\nA sick tool click\u2014the whole industry screwed up\nI roll with great MCs that keep a tape queued up\nBoot butt, put your lights out, run in your sessions\nSplit blessings, steal Sharpies and whiteout\nSalute to small vinyl.  Wild like bulletproof vinyl\nStronghold alliance.  The world\u2019s full of psychos\nC-Rayz Walz used to be 180.  Still get busy\nThis time, sixteen bars leave you dizzy\nI used to rewrite hooks.  Now I just hook right\nControlling tempo like a point guard with nice looks, aight?\nYou ain\u2019t prepare \u2018cause this is what you scared of\nI\u2019m loud like mankind, write without the weird glove\nIt\u2019s a must I drop the dookie def shit\nSkeptics get wrecked with my electric effort\nEnergy session, total concentration with blessings\nBassline kick with powerful impact progression"}]}
