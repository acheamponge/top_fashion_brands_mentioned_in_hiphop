You wanna go deep? I\u2019ll take you deep\nReality is really just cheap\nYo\u2019 eyes wide open apparently, but you sleep\nAnd everything you have in your hands you\u2019ll never keep\nSo why hold on, I flow on to go on, before long I float on\nEternal life is what I'm thinkin\u2019 I'mma bank my hope on\nBelieve me, easy is irrelevant\nThe devil want us burning for the hell of it\nElephants in the room say we can't talk about impending doom\nOr we gospel rappin\u2019 or preaching people out of they shoes\nIt\u2019s cool, I'll be that dude\nWe glued to our depravity\nUntil somebody free us from this gravity, fly!\nI want to go, one day\nI want to go, somewhere where there's no gravity\nWhere there's no gravity\n\n[Hook: J.R.]\nYeah, every time I think I\u2019m flying\nI\u2019m just falling\nSo close to touching the sky\nBut gravity keeps pulling me back down\nBut I can\u2019t stay here forever"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
