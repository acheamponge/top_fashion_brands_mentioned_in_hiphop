Yeah\nNowhere to run to nowhere to hide\nSittin' on the front stoop right outside\nIn the moonlight when I take flight I fly\nCrank the engine, then I break out like I'm benchin'\nThousands of pounds spit thousands of rounds\nAnd verses help 'em out like a found missin' person\nThis time I'mma try to lounge on the cursin'\nSo people can hear how my rap sound perfect\nCould hate a nigga but in fact it's not worth it\nNever know how long you've got on this earth kid\nCount them blesses and pay them dues\nKeep rollin' with the winners cause they don't lose\nIn the two G-era the skies is looking clearer\nAnd nothing can stop them guys that's in the mirror\nSo thankful that I keep my hands on the bankroll\nCan't play the shit wreck, falling of the plankroll\nSo I stay stable like a natural born hustler\nKickin' that hot shit right for all the customers\nNear or far comin' here to star\nI'll be pourin' out beer in the park\nFor my loved ones\nDeep and thick is how my love runs for you\nSo with no further ado\nI'mma smash it kick that shit they call acid\n24 hours a day remain classic\n\nChorus\n[Q-Tip] In the sun.. sun.. su.. su.. su.. sun\n[Large] ah, in the sun kid\n[Q-Tip] Keep going\n[Q-Tip] In the sun.. sun.. su.. su.. su.. sun\n[Large] ah, in the sun kid\n[Q-Tip] Keep growing\n[Q-Tip] In the sun.. sun.. su.. su.. su.. sun\n[Large] yeah, in the sun kid\n[Q-Tip] Keep moving\n[Q-Tip] In the sun.. sun.. su.. su.. su.. sun\n[Large] ah, in the sun kid\n[Q-Tip] We keep it moving\n[Q-Tip] In the sun.. sun.. su.. su.. su.. sun\n[Large] ah, in the sun kid\n[Q-Tip] We can't stop it\n[Q-Tip] In the sun.. sun.. su.. su.. su.. sun\n[Large] yeah, in the sun kid\n\n[Q-Tip]\nI arise from my melinence to the sun beginning\nKiss by the ray of a sunny day\nBut I feel it in my bone, a child's without a home\nA prison cell holds a dream to a black teen\nI never thought I'd see the day when brothers pledge allegiance\nTo a red white and blue that's wavin' untrue\nYo, where's the forty acres and the mule, huh?\nYou rather give us Mickey D's and a tool, huh?\nAnd in the sun I see the way you pull our hearts' strings\nAnd in the sun I see your old way to new things\nEvery man has to bow down to God's grace\nEvery soul has to concede to God's goal\nPoliticians get religious to a starved people\nAs the constitution reads, it says I'm not equal\nThree fifths of the gifts from a love supreme\nThis gotta be a bad dream, I'm hearing trains scream\nLittle kids are getting warped from computer thoughts\nFamily structure is destroyed, marriage null and void\nAll has gotten formulated, really hate to say it\nBut I can see it easy, really, in the sun\n\n[Hook] without LP\n\n[Large Professor]\nYo don't ever think I've forgotten\nThem days black plottin'\nAnd schemin'\nSittin' in the lunchroom\nEatin' and dreamin'\nOn about the things we do\nWhen we reach independence\nNothing is brand new\nIt's all still accordin' to plan\nMeet your man\nFrom decades ago can't nobody understand\nThe hardships we've been through\nSun to sun\nOn the wake up knock knock\nEverybody gotta run for the ultimate goal\nCan't lose they soul\nIn the process\nSo and to you I say God bless\nSeeing your face lets me see my own\nSo I zone, and think about the days we got stoned\nIn the staircase of apartment buildings\nLittle childrens\nGrowing in a world so cold\nJust like pilgrims, we migrate daily\nNow a days we rarely get to see one another\nBut when we connect we still brothers\nAnd now we in the corporate world\nAnd the game is different\nYou get caught up in the twirl\nIf your fam ain't affective\nSo here's our perspective\nTo help each other\nCause man ain't it hectic\n\n[Hook] to fade"}], "artist": "Large Professor"}
