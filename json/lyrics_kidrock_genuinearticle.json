Clemens basements\nI scratched records and performed a few tricks\nKDC mixed, let the Black Man talk shit\nPumpin the new sounds town to town\nWho holds it down like Bad Leroy Brown\nNow I won't stop cause yo I'm Kid Rock\nThe Genuine Article\n\n[Chorus]\nThey don't want me\nCause I worked like a bitch to get the job done\n\n[Verse 2]\nF-F-Fames a costin the price ain't nice\nIts like the roll of the dice\nFor a whole new life\nBut don't get my song wrong\nI enjoy it alot\nWalkin around like a big shot\nCause I'm Kid Rock\nSmooth as an ice cube\nCool as an igloo\nAnd more complex, than a Rubik's cube\nA healthy wealthy young one with a quick tongue\nSmart from the start and from the heart my rhymes run\nAnd as I incline thru time to get mine\nI try not to slide, but walk a straight line\nThough it's hard when the climb gets steep\nThe one who finds is the one who seeks\nSo I sought and fought\nAnd a lot got taught\nAnd those keleptos who stole got caught\nMany shows I rocked at\nMany suckers I laughed at\nAnd those who snapped back usually got slapped\nOr capped if I was strapped\nCause I was a son of a gun\nLivin life on the run\nNow I pleaded 18 and outdone by none\nBold, young, handsome, bad like Bronson\nPumpin the new sounds town to town\nAnd when in motown I cool out in Greektown\nOn the upside with nuthin too hide\nThe Genuine Article\n\n[Chorus]\nThey don't want me\nCause I worked like a bitch to get the job done\n\nChuck nice break that beat down\n\n[Verse 3]\nSix Generations of rap and I'm first\nReady to burst, the style is rehearsed\nI worked and worked and worked and I worked\nWhen many thought I was just gettin jerked\nUsed, abused, but I paid my dues\nAnd now no one out there could fill my shoes\nAnd my pants and do this dance\nThis shit didn't happen by chance\nIt went slow not quick, but now I'm your pick\nAin't that a trip when I started from zip\nAnd now up and up and up I won't stop\nThe flop just pop the flat top the Kid Rock\nYes me the low key MC\nWith the ability to rock a party\nAnywhere and make people stare\nI'm lookin while I'm cookin with no care\nPumpin the new sound town to town\nWho holds it down like bad Leroy Brown\nAnd still I won't stop growin this flat top\n\nThe Genuine Article\n[Chorus]"}]}
