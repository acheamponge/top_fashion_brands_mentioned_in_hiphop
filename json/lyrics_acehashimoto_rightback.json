Yeah, I found that\nFrom the west side, where I lay down at\nI got my sound back\nAnd I'm solar\nI shine better when the day is over\nLet me take you to a place colder\nAnd you could put my jacket on your shoulder\nJust let me know, huh\nIs that right, huh?\nYou ain't gon' give in, you gotta fight, huh?\nYou just can't do it all in one night, huh?\nYou gotta make me think you all nice, huh?\n(Yeah, that's right)\nWell, I can't hate that\nIt would be an honor just to date that\nSomewhere out of town where a lake at\nA little Al Green on that 8-track\nLet's go way back\n\n[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]\nI say, \"What's up, girl?'\nShe say, \"What's up?\" right back\nI say, \"What up, girl\"\nShe say, \"What's up?\" right back\nI say, \"What's up, girl?'\nShe say, \"What's up?\" right back\nI say, \"What up, girl\"\nShe say, \"What's up?\" right back\nYou like my style, huh? (I never thought about it)\nYou want me now, huh? (Nope, I never thought about it)\nWe having kids, huh? (I never thought about it)\nYes, you did, huh? (Nope, I never thought about it)\n\n[Verse 2: brandUn DeShay]\nYo, on some real shit\nYou looking like the type I wanna chill with\nYou wondering why I'm rapping on some chill shit\nBut really, I'm just rapping on my Dom shit\nI'm off my mind and shit\nTell me what else is new, trying to get in your head like some Selsun Blue\nAnd where you going? 'Cause I need to be going, too\nYou try to shut me down twice, now I'm 0-and-2\nAnd I ain't one to lose except my mind over you\nGreat tits, amazing face, and got crazy legs\nYou dance in circles around my game like Crazy Legs\nI got a soft spot for you like a baby head\nAnd you made me red in the face like a white guy\nI ain't the toughest nigga, but look on the bright side\nIf you win the R&B this year, I'm your right guy\nI don't sing much, but you need to have me on your team, girl\nI'll be batting clean up\n\n[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]\nI say, \"What's up, girl?'\nShe say, \"What's up?\" right back\nI say, \"What up, girl\"\nShe say, \"What's up?\" right back\nI say, \"What's up, girl?'\nShe say, \"What's up?\" right back\nI say, \"What up, girl\"\nShe say, \"What's up?\" right back\nYou like my style, huh? (I never thought about it)\nYou want me now, huh? (Nope, I never thought about it)\nWe having kids, huh? (I never thought about it)\nYes, you did, huh? (Nope, I never thought about it)\n\n[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]\nThen we\nTake a little ride in the Bentley\nNah, I'm just playing, that's my friend's Jeep\nBut I'm gon' get me one off of this beat\nLet's make history\nI write my own book\nAnd a skit and a verse and my own hook\n'Til we doing more numbers than a phone book\nI'm cool on trends, I got my own look\nIt's called the \"OWN\" look\nDid you catch that?\nI'm coming out Leimert, I gotta rep that\nSame place you need to get your rest at\nI'm just being real, you can expect that\n(Yeah, I respect that)\nBut you don't smile much\nI just want a chance to correct that\nYour heart is on your sleeve, can I protect that?\nI will 1-800 call collect that\nYou gotta accept that\n\n[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]\nI say, \"What's up, girl?'\nShe say, \"What's up?\" right back\nI say, \"What up, girl\"\nShe say, \"What's up?\" right back\nI say, \"What's up, girl?'\nShe say, \"What's up?\" right back\nI say, \"What up, girl\"\nShe say, \"What's up?\" right back\nYou like my style, huh? (I never thought about it)\nYou want me now, huh? (Nope, I never thought about it)\nWe having kids, huh? (I never thought about it)\nYes, you did, huh?
