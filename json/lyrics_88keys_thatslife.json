(Whatchu gonna do?)\nThat's life (That's life), baby, I would spend it all witchu (All with you)\n\n[Verse 2: Mac Miller]\nAnd I'm headed to the other side, where the grass is always greener\nAnd your bitch is down to ride, but that ass is always meaner\nSee, my cash got deeper and my morals disappeared\nNever thought I'd be a asshole, this my last show\nCan I please get a standing ovation?\nA hunnid naked bitches in my dressing room waiting\nWe lost a lot of blood for this fucked up nation\nBut me, I'm getting high, making love in that spaceship\nSo what are the basics? Tell me your problems\nYou losin' your job or, even worse, you don't got one\nSo hard to stay sober when you feeling fucked over so much\nAlways coming up short, you like the roach of a blunt (Yeah)\nAnd I could never sleep at night\nFuck paying bills, I need a brand new lease on life\nWhy does doing wrong always feel so right?\nWell, I guess, fuck it, that's life (That's life)\n\n[Chorus: Mac Miller]\nYeah, I know it seem a little bit strange sometimes (Yeah, yeah)\nEverybody live a little, everybody die (Yeah, yeah)\nThat's life (That's life), whatchu gonna do? (Whatchu gonna do?)\nThat's life (That's life), baby, I would spend it all witchu (All with you)\n\n[Bridge: Sia]\nNow, I wish I could take all your pain\nBut when the toxin is fame\nThe drugs, they don't fill the hole, no\nConnections the game\nWish you'd picked up the phone\nKnew that I'd be your home\nKnew that you weren't alone\nKnew that you weren't alone\nKnew that you weren't alone\n\n[Outro: Sia]\nI saw you act a little bit strange sometimes, you'd say:\n\"Yeah, everybody lives and everybody dies, one day\"\nWell, that's right, whatchu gonna do?\nThat's life, and I wish you could have spent it on the truth", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1b2ca3520ed031069b5450a86c1bab67.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2019-06-20", "title": "That\u2019s Life"}]}
