I'm Nicholas Nickleby\nYou better pick a team\nThere's no in between\nYou want a nickelbag\nYou want some nicotine\nYou wanted a fix\nI will never be your goldmine\nTaking my kicks\nAnd I'm hanging em over the phoneline\nSo you can find me, posted feeling so fine\n\n[Verse 2]\nAt Buena Vista elementary in second grade\nOne whistle is when recess ends\nTwo whistles is an earthquake drill\nThree means every kid better hit the deck\nUnless you want to catch a stray bullet or a ricochet from a fight across the chainlink fence\nI know that I don't look it but grew up in the middle of the city where only the quick make friends\nA kid in Frisco\nNavigating Lombard\nNo On Star\nI'm on BART\nNo lawn darts\nNot saying I'm hard\nBut I got street val for my pokemon cards\nBetter put me onto Pawn stars\nAnd I'll Barter like my gramma when she wants art\nEvery block or two I skate around another beggar\nLeaning on a cop car\nBaked as a pop tart", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c29f84b2362a2e43218c9c9f8eb13126.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "A New Kind of Sexy", "title": "Pumped Up Kicks Remix"}]}
