WHAT?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow niggas got the studio poppin', it's mad clearer\nEngineers got his earplugs and still hear us\nThe live-in-the-park sound versus the studio state of art sound. We on the charts now\nFrom British Walkers and Argyles\nLook at us rap stars now, with our black cars now\nFortune 500 listed, brunches, sip Cipriani's\nSippin', blunted, with rich white guys around me\nThick white girls around me, Chinese lined up\nBecause I'm what? Every dime lust\nWe used to be a ghetto secret; can't make my mind up\nIf I want that or the whole world to peep it\nNow carry on tradition\nFuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'\nPeace to the strugglin' artists and dead one's gone, we miss 'em.\u00a0I promise I carry on tradition\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Nas"}
