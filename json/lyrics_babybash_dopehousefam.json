soldado\nPuffin' on an avocado\nWith my foot up on the throttle\nAnd a bottle of the Bourbon cause I swerve in the low-low\nSolo, fo sho', homies gettin' more dough\nSleeping is for dreamers on the

hustler, twenty thousand miles just this summer\nEver since the first day of June, napping on a cama\nGot that Boomerang glow, once I throw it in the pot\nIs coming right back I promise, dawg I'm blowing up the spot\nListen, is only me I got a million dollar corner\nFeds tap my house phone and they still out of order\nI'm the son of a preacher man, momma knows I'm thuggin'\nAnd I should of been a chef the way I cook crack up your oven met\nTeachers taught us \"just say no\", I had to hustle though\nEven that I stayed broke, didn't want to struggle so\nBuy half and eight ball, hit the block runnin'\nThough the world was mine, till I saw the cops coming\nAnd it's too late\n\n[Verse 10: Low-G]My homie died and the cops called it drug related\nI was standing right there when his mother fainted\nAnd I felt trapped, cause I know I gotta choose fate\nI grabbed my nina and made that bitch loose weight\nSince eighty-eight with a nick in my tube socks\nI been a G since you was tryin' to do the moonwalk\nI'm from a place that they call Honduras\nNothing fake about my life except my car insurance\nBullet proof vest, my jefa sense stress\nNothing positive about me, except my piss test\nI grew up in a house full of empty stomachs\nWhile other kids was at Mcdonald's getting twenty nuggets\nAnd I'm known all across the ghettos\nBoy you think the fuckin' law, so don't pawn my huevos\nMy chrome spits and I know to chase hoe clicks\nNate at the club dancing with a glow sticks\n\n[Chorus]\nThrow your hood up\nAll my G's rep...\n\n[Pain interrupts Chorus]\n\n[Bridge one: Pain
