S\u00ed se\u00f1orita\nWhatsApp only, I'm overseas, I'm in Beverley Hills I might phone Genita\nWith my Spanish girl, playing FIFA\nMas tequila? S\u00ed se\u00f1orita\nWhatsApp only, I'm overseas, I'm in Beverley Hills I might phone Genita\n\n[Verse 2]\nDinero's, what I'm out to get\nSombrero, I get hat and then I'm out again\nGot an A1 chica with a drive like a three litre\nThat's what she needs D for like the alphabet\nI'm exclusive, not for anyone\nAnd many girls wanna diss 'cause they ain't getting none\nI told my baby \"Don't worry what a hoe say\" 'cause me and you both know you're the special one\nAnd if I can't get a ring for your hand, you can leave Chelsea and fly into Milan\nYou click once, I'ma give you what you want but you still won't ask for a thing from a man\nDo you think that you can tell a guy to give you the world and you can't do a thing for a man\nMy baby don't judge me for breaking the law, we're square, she was there taking trips to the bank\n\n[Chorus]\nWith my Spanish girl, playing FIFA\nMas tequila?
