Darker the skin, the more the appetizer\nAmplify their eyes wide shut\nThe 85ers can't recognize us\nThey won't get it; we live to its limits\nHer jewels are endless\nThe food polish pearls wit friction\nThe world infliction, addiction\nAs the Earth twirl out in space, suspended\nAnimation expensive, canvas paintings by Claude Monet\nYou're in the streets all week but wit the Lord Sunday\nIt's more gunplay, more funerals\nMore young graves, the usual\nHeard Marvin Gaye or Big Pun say\n\"It's so haaaaaaaarrrrrrdddd!\"\nI'ma soldier wit the pages and pen\nYou a soldier wit grenades wit the pin\nThe wages of sin is death\nThe greatest offence is deaf\nWait, you enter in as a guest\nBut you want, revenge or respect\n\n[Killah Priest]\nSo here's a tribute for judges gon' mute\nWe salute, fire congress Smith for tellin' the truth\nCheers to the system felon on you\nRebell or get loose, here's to the troops\nMandatory suspension\nThis goes out to the cameras wit the bad lenses\nNo love for the hands branded wit sixes\nPeace to the man-hand wit the crucifixes\nI know Lucifer's listenin'\nPeace to Black Jesus\nThe Black Jesus that relates to wave cap and sneakers\nThe Black Jesus that won't judge either\nCuz he knows about the back of the bus and why we buss heaters\nIn him we trust, plus he's a thug to keep us from locked up\nOr shot up, we love Black Jesus\nAnd for the people that say he ain't a saint\nHe right there wit us in the clank\nAnd only thing that make 'em cry is the white paint\nBlack Jesus, I saw 'em packin' a stima\nNot to kill you, but he knows it's real too\nWe love you Black Jesus, he'll neva sell out\nAt the White House, matter of fact he might get kicked out\nCuz he wants the hood to hear what's he's talkin' about\nBlack Jesus"}]}
