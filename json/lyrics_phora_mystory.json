this is for anyone who's ever had a broken dream\nOr a fucked up childhood, never lose hope\n\n[Verse 1: Phora]\nSee I was raised by a single mother\nNo father figure, little sister, never had a brother\nNever had another man teach me how to be one\nYeah, momma had a man, but he was never calling me son\nAnd even if he did yo I would never take him serious\nCause people say they love me, but it's funny\nCause I don't think they know what love really is\nCause love ain't when you hurt a person\nLove ain't avoiding a problem, you should be getting involved\nLove ain't, when you pick somebody up by the neck\nThen you grab his head and you slam it right into the wall\nI was a troubled kid in school, so I just kept to myself\nPsychologists ordered me medicine, it never did help\nCause every time I took it, I was never myself\nI wasn't G, I never had a strap next to my belt\nJust a regular kid that never joined the sports team\nAnd every time I'd tried to talk to a girl, she'd ignore me\nStarted hanging around stupid kids and broke a few laws\nHad a few problems, painted a few walls\nBut one day, something happened that changed my life forever\nSomething that I'll always remember\nI said one day, something happened that changed my life forever\nSomething that I'll always remember\nCheck\n\n[Verse 2: Phora]\nI was walking home after school with two friends from my class\nAnd then I seen a sketchy face walk past\nBut at the time I didn't think of it much\nCause 'round here there's always sketchy cats, tweakers and such\nSo I just kept walking till I got to King's Drive\nThen seen a bunch of motherfuckers giving me the stink eye\nThey started surrounding me, stopped me in my place\nAnd right outside the circle I seen a familiar face\nA cat that I used to be tight with\nNever had no problems with him\nBut I guess he's smoking some nice shit\nHe came right towards me\nI said, \"Fuck it, then fine, let's catch a fair one\"\nThen caught a cheap shot from behind\nI ran, they tripped me and caught me\nThey stomped me and kicked me\nKicks to my face, punches to my ribs and my kidneys\nThen what happened next, you just might not believe\nBut everybody scattered, I was trying to breathe\nStudents, parents, and teachers, their watching me bleed\nBut nobody did shit, I was watching 'em leave\nAs I was dying, bleeding, losing my conscious\nFlashed backs of reminders of things I've never accomplished\nEverything turned white, then everything was fine\nNo more worries, nothing on my mind\nNo pain, no nothing, I guess it was my time\nThen my whole life flashed right in front of my eyes\nBut all of the sudden I snapped back to reality\nTook a look around but no ambulance was surrounding me\nGuess this is how it ends, huh?\nI guess this is what my momma meant when she said watch your friends, huh?\nGuess I should have listened, but now it's too late\nTaking my last breath getting closer to my fate\nAnd right when I felt I was good with dying\nA voice in my head said, \"Don't stop, keep trying\"\nSo I got my ass up, walked to school and dialed nine one one\nTrue story, fuck what you think you could do for me\nFifteen years old, just another victim\nJust another kid that would end up dead or in prison\nGot to the hospital, the doctor said they don't know if I'mma live\nImmediate surgery tube through my ribs\nI could barely breathe, I was bleeding out\nThat's when I met God, yeah I can see him now\nWith a collapsed lung and two stab wounds\nI'm losing blood quick, but I ain't going that soon\nEverybody left, but I had strength in myself\n\"I'mma be aight\", that's what I say to myself\nYeah, and sure enough I kept on breathing\nAlmost paralyzed for the next three weekends\nPrivate numbers calling, death threats to my family\nEven named my little sis, so how can you be mad at me\nWhen I told you that I fear for our safety\nCause no street cred is worth my mothers place G\nThey asked me who it was and I let em' know\nI ain't ashamed of my choice and I don't regret it yo\nCause truth is, I don't follow no one's rules\nI do what I feel's right, I ain't no one's mule\nThe whole thing was recorded and put up online\nBut you should know, if you can't do the time, don't do the crime\nSee I ain't no G, just a man with a passion\nBut I always took responsibility for my actions\nI never hurt a soul in my life, I'm a family man\nAlways kept my word, so tell me how bad of a man I am\nCause when it comes down to it, all you got is you\nAnd we all gotta survive, do what you gotta do\nFifteen years old, left in the dust\nThe world taught me never to love and never to trust\nNah, but now I know my purpose, now I know what I'm here for\nNow I know what I've been waiting all these years for\nFifteen years old, left in the dust\nThe world taught me never to love and never to trust\nNah, but now I know my purpose, now I know what I'm here for\nNow I know why I've been waiting all these years\nYours truly",
