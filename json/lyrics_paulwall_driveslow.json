Sure nigga with the hair all wavy\nHit Lakeshore girls, go all crazy\nHit the freeway, go at least 'bout 80\nBoned so much that summer, even had him a baby\nSee back back then then if you had a car\nYou was the Chi-Town version of Baby\nAnd I was just a virgin, a baby\nOne of the reasons I looked up to him crazy\nI used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked\nFelt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked\nWe'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall\nThey had they Lakers and our Royals, we was hurtin 'em all\nWith the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but Dawg\nFuck all that flirtin' I'm tryin' to get in some drawers, so\nPut me on with these hoes homey\nHe told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow homey\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nDrive slow homey...\nDrive slow\nYou never know homey, about these hoes homey\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey\n\n[Verse 2: Paul Wall]\nWhat it do; I'm posted up in the parkin lot, my trunk wavin'\nThe candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazin'\nThem elbows pokin wide on that candy 'llac\nTrunk open, screens on, neon's lit with 5th relaxed\nI'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies\nAllow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes\nIt's a star-studded event when I valet park\nOpen up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark\nYou see them fo's crawlin, you see them screens fallin'\nThe disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'\nI'm leanin' on the switch, sittin crooked in my slab\nBut I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab\nA young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla\nRidin' somethin candy coated, crawlin like a caterpillar\nI'm tippin' on them 4's, I'm jammin' on that Screw\nI'm lookin' for them hoes baby what it do\n\n[Kanye West]\nDrive slow homey...\n\n[GLC]\nTurn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes\n\n[Kanye West]\nDrive slow homey...\n\n[GLC]\nIf you ridin' around the city with nowhere to go\n\n[Kanye West]\nDrive slow homey...\n\n[GLC]\nLive today cause tomorrow man, you never know...\n\n[Verse 3: Kanye West]\nYou never know homey, might meet some hoes homey\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey\nMy car's like the movie, my car's like the crib\nI got mo' TV's in here than where I live\n\n[Verse 4: GLC]\nAnd that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit\nAnd everything I flip, you know it's somethin' serious\nI got the custom grill, I got the Bravis rims\nI got the baller genetics baby this evidence\nYou see a player flickin' and how you ain't convinced\nThat you should go on and kiss it, \"Just a Little' Bit\"\nJust a lil' bit\nI got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain\nMy canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings\nThey see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king\nWith that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green\nMy woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues\nMy cylinder quiet, like tip-toes\nI sold O's, and this I know\nWhen you see them hoes, lil' homey drive slow...\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nDrive slow homey...\nDrive slow homey...\nYou never know homey, might meet some hoes homey\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey\nDrive slow homey", "year": null}]}
