(Away, away)\nOh, oh, doctor\nGive me what I need to get me through the day (The day, the day)\nI want that feel good\nThat feel good\nThat feel good\nThat feel good\nThat real good (Real good), yeah\nI want that feel good\nThat feel good\nThat feel good\nThat feel good\nThat real good (That real good)\nDr. Feel Good, help me\n\n[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]\nLately, I've been beside myself\nAnd it's unlike me to hide myself\nIt's not like I like being by myself\nI wanna see the world, but can't decide myself\nWhether or not to get up off this couch\nWhether or not to get up out this house\nI wanna know what it's like to feel real good\nIs there something you can prescribe, Dr. Feel Good?\nI mean he's so happy, she's so free Doctor, what in the world is wrong with me?\nI just need some reassurance, I know my carrier won't be insuring this\nIf you could just be earnest\nOops, I meant honest and make this promise\nIf any of this makes sense, let 'em know I wasn't crazy, just thoroughly convinced\n\n[Chorus: CeeLo Green & Travie McCoy]\nDoctor\nWon't you come and help me take this pain away? (Away, away)\nTake the pain away, take the pain away\nOh, oh, doctor (Doctor)\nGive me what I need to get me through the day (The day, the day)\nGet me through the day, through the day\nI want that feel good\nThat feel good\nThat feel good\nThat feel good\nThat real good (Real good), yeah\nI want that feel good\nThat feel good\nThat feel good\nThat feel good\nThat real good (That real good)\nDr. Feel Good, help me\n\n[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]\nShe got the set of lips like a sedative\nEvery time I kiss, it's like medicine\nSomething said to me no, no, don't let her in\n'Cause every time I do, I end up upset again\nAnd then it's back to the waiting room\nWaiting patiently for them to bring another patient to 'em\nAnything is possible\nEspecially when you see it in the hospital\nI hope Dr. Feel Good can fix me\nAnd help me find peace of mind before 50\n(Mr. McCoy, you're up next)\nI made a detour quickly\nHightailed it towards the exit door before they could get me\nIt didn't take much to lose 'em\nBut before I got home, I came to a conclusion\nThat feeling good means another appointment\nTake two of these and don't expect a call in the morning\n\n[Chorus: CeeLo Green & Travie McCoy]\nDoctor\nWon't you come and help me take this pain away? (Away, away)\nTake the pain away, take the pain away\nOh, oh, doctor (Doctor)\nGive me what I need to get me through the day (The day, the day)\nGet me through the day, through the day\nI want that feel good\nThat feel good\nThat feel good\nThat feel good\nThat real good (Real good), yeah\nI want that feel good\nThat feel good\nThat feel good\nThat feel good\nThat real good (That real good)\nDr. Feel Good, help me\n\n[Bridge: Travie McCoy]\nLadies and gentlemen, hey, pardon me, patients\nSee what I'mma do right now is break it down\nPut your hands together\nRepeat after me, come on\nI feel good (I feel good)\nReal good (Real good)\nI feel good (I feel good)\nReal good (Real good)\n\n[Chorus: CeeLo Green & Travie McCoy]\nDoctor\nWon't you come and help me take this pain away?\nTake the pain away, take the pain away\nOh, oh, doctor (Doctor)\nGive me what I need to get me through the day\nGet me through the day, through the day\nI want that feel good\nThat feel good\nThat feel good\nThat feel good\nThat real good (Real good), yeah\nI want that feel good\nThat feel good\nThat feel good\nThat feel good\nThat real good (That real good)\nDr. Feel Good, help me\n\n[Outro: Travie McCoy]\nYeah\nI'll let this one ride out\nYeah, brought to you by yours truly, Mr. CeeLo Green\nThe delectable Smeezingtons\nThank y'all for comin' out\nGod bless\nGood night\nTravie, by the way"}], "artist": "Travie McCoy"}
