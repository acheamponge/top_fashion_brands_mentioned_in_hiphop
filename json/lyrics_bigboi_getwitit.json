roll up (Roll up)\nCan't talk about it, be about it, we gon' have to see about it\nYeah, and get wit it, get wit it...and roll up, roll up\n\n[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nIsaiah 54:17, no weapon formed against me shall prosper\nI got a whole team of angels guarding me from all the danger\nAnd keep that .357 under my seat for all the haters\nRappin', one of the last rap niggas snappin'\nNiggas playin' sleep, I'm St. Nick with the package\nBlessed with the gift and only 3 Stacks can match me\nLight years ahead of you niggas, another galaxy\nBoi keep the club packed to capacity\nHands in the air. bitches make it clap for me\nAutomatically, the DJ bring it back for me\nAnd drop a bomb on it with the horns (Yeah)\nGlobally adored\nFor sure put Atlanta on the board and I'll be runnin' up the score No etiquette like Belichick and Brady on you hoes\nSee, now teamwork make the dream work, that's how it goes\n\n[Chorus: Big Boi]\nNow it's a few rules to the game if you really wanna play\nLet's get this straight off top\nBitch get wit it (Bitch, get wit it)\nAnd roll up (Roll up)\nCan't talk about it, be about it, we gon' have to see about it\nYeah, and get wit it, get wit it...and roll up, roll up\n\n[Post Chorus: Big Boi + (Snoop Dogg)]\nGotta keep the money coming on time (Money)\nNeed to go ahead and get your mind right (Paper)\nRecognize it's pimpin', bitch, you gon' get wit it, roll up\nBlowing on strong all day\nShawty keep looking this way (Say what?)\nShe recognize the pimpin' and she gon' get wit it\nAnd roll up\n\n[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]\nFirst thing she seen when I fell through\nA little bit of talk but I walks with a clear view\nDynamic, organic, Iceberg Slim selling trim on the Titanic\nUnderwater wit' it, let me show you how to do it to the fullest\nI'm the hardest, I'm the realest, I'm the dopest, I'm the coolest\nWhile I'm doing, while I'm doing, check it out\nAnd I ain't gotta have a motherfucking record out\nI'm just a West Coast player, say 'fee fi fo'\nLong Beach nigga with that Eastside flow\nDipped in the sauce, 'imp with the limp\nI'm a pimp and a boss, let me show you how to get it off\nKeep a blue flag to the left of me\nAnd shoot my shit with trajectory\nBig money, big cars, big toys making big noise\nHolla at 'em Big Boi\n\n[Chorus: Big Boi]\nNow it's a few rules to the game if you really wanna play\nLet's get this straight off top\nBitch get wit it (Bitch, get wit it)\nAnd roll up (Roll up)\nCan't talk about it, be about it, we gon' have to see about it\nYeah, and get wit it, get wit it...and roll up, roll up\n\n[Post Chorus: Big Boi + (Snoop Dogg)]\nGotta keep the money coming on time (Money, money)\nNeed to go ahead and get your mind right (Get it, get it)\nRecognize it's pimpin', bitch, you gon' get wit it, roll up\nBlowing on strong all day\nShawty keep looking this way (What she looking at?)\nShe recognize the pimpin' and she gon' get wit it\nAnd roll up\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nI'm true to it, had a yellow Cadillac\nAnd I sold my blue Buick\nSpend a lot of money but I'll never blow through it\nNever blew through it\nOnly thing I blow through is pussy, I'm never pushy\nIn my youth I used to lock it but I don't (I loved her)\nLike that, because I'm married and I won't (Do nothin')\nSplit that pie up, no more, it's gone\nSince Thanksgiving, I split it four ways, it's wrong\nWrong all for my kids and my family\nFirst generation Patton clan, bitch, get at me\nI's da pappy\u2014the papi and the father\nThe only Maury I rock with are gators or [?]\nCrocs, I'm sharper than your Sharper Image\nIn your catalog, nigga, eat your spinach\nOr your leafy greens, long BB team\nWe don't see no seeds, it's straight bud like their roses\n\n[Chorus: Big Boi + (Snoop Dogg)]\nNow it's a few rules to the game if you really wanna play\nLet's get this straight off top\nBitch get wit it (Bitch, get wit it)\nAnd roll up (Roll up)\nCan't talk about it, be about it, we gon' have to see about it\nYeah, and get wit it, get wit it...\n(You gots to get wit this shit, mayne)\nAnd roll up, roll up (It's real pimpin', man)\n\n[Post Chorus: Big Boi + (Snoop Dogg)]\nGotta keep the money coming on time (We gettin' money)\nNeed to go ahead and get your mind right (Straight pimpin')\nRecognize it's pimpin', bitch, you gon' get wit it, roll up\n(Recognize when it's in your face, you little bitch)\nBlowing on strong all day (Yes, sir)\nShawty keep looking this way (Ya dig?)\nShe recognize the pimpin' and she gon' get wit it\nAnd roll up\n\n[Outro: Snoop Dogg]\nSay man, she got to choose up, man\nI thought you thought, man\nBitch been looking at me all motherfucking night\nYeah, get in where you fit in\nHahahahaha,,,", "image": "https://images.genius.com/62ac77014890d9620ef8186d7f2f5893.620x620x1.jpg",
