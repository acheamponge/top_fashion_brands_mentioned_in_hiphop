Your fist\nWill raise in the air\nLike the silence of revolution\nMy face will appear\nLike the vision of a prisoner with his last beer\nThis song is a poem and this whole poem is a tear\nDropped to your ear\n\n[Outro]\nSo why do kids cry when they born?\nEver ask yourself that?\nWell, it is said that Satan stabs a child at birth\nAs an introduction to pain\nYou know, welcome to the world right?"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
