{"songs": [{"title": "Time To Relax", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\n\nThis ain\u2019t a song, it\u2019s more like a note to self\nA reminder to me that I need balance\n\u2018cause I\u2019m always working, plannin\u2019 projects and preppin\u2019\nStressin\u2019 over the state of this world and how we affect it\nThis is part of the gift, the energy that I\u2019m blessed with\nBut if you overuse them, then you will blunt your own weapons\nHow ever much you train, muscles only grow when you rest \u2018em\nYet I don\u2019t make enough time to stop and pause for reflection\nGo and check my mum, talk about nothing much\nOn a sunny day, sit in the park, stare at the sun\nFeed the ducks, ride a bike, shit sit in a tree\nAnything to escape the stress that the city will breed\nLucky enough, that what I love is my livin\u2019\nI know that that\u2019s rare so chillin\u2019 just feels like sinnin\u2019\nBut it\u2019s not, take your time, you ain\u2019t gotta say sorry\nIf you\u2019re always exhausted, you can\u2019t help anybody\n\n[Chorus]\n\nThrough all the work and the wages, bills and the tax\nThrough all the stress and the payments and the [?]\nThrough all the loss and the gain and the pain we attach\nThrough all the stress and the strain that came with the facts\nWe gotta kick back, make time to relax\nGotta kick back, make time to relax\nGotta kick back, make time to relax\nKick back, make time to relax\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nYou\u2019re not paranoid, things really are designed\nTo offer you absolutely no peace of mind\nMaybe that\u2019s the price to be paid \u2018cause we\u2019re complicit in suffering all over this world that we are living in\nCars and the clothes, everything we consume\nStill painted in the suffering of colourful hues\nSo we\u2019re tainted by the nothingness of what we\u2019ll choose\nBut overwhelmed by the lack of change if we refuse\nSo we all watch the so called news\nAnd see their views of a bunch of mass murderers paraded as true\nEnough to turn any thinking person to a lunatic\nMaybe thats what we already are \u2018cause we are used to it\nBut in the midst of all this\nThere\u2019s a bliss that you\u2019re missing\nSilent moments, one that you love quietly kissin\u2019\nStarin\u2019 at the stars, realising that ours is just a world among billions of worlds that we\u2019ll never know\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nJust take a moment to breathe, is what I\u2019m sayin\u2019\nBreathe deep till the air in your chest is all the way in\nLet it out slowly, feel the tension erodin\u2019\nListen to the music [?] before you compose it\nJust take a moment to breathe and take stock\nYou ain\u2019t that important, wars will not stop if you do not\nBut health and longevity depends on balance between yin and yang\nAnd so far I just haven\u2019t\nMade enough time to breathe and just chill\nKeep still\nThey ain\u2019t lyin\u2019 when they say stress kills\nSo breathe before you punch someone in the mouth\nBreathe deep before you push out and tear down the house\nBreathe before you hurt yourself and your health\nMaybe clich\u00e9 but it really is our true source of wealth\nBreathe - essence of life and of the universe\nWe\u2019ve done it from birth yet we doubt that it really works\n\n[Chorus]", "year": "2015-03-30", "album": "Knowledge Is Power II", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7c518a58eebfd479e5ad2216b0cd1a85.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
