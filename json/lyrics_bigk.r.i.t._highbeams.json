'Cause\nThis is how we all eat\nThe sun don't shine like I need it to\nWhen I'm fiending through my need for cool\nIt's hot for days and the breeze is through\nI'm overheating, my fuse is blew\nI shine, I shine, my light, my light, my light\nPlease shine, please shine, for my sight, my sight, my sight, my sight\nI shine, I shine, my light, my light\nPlease shine, please shine, for my sight\n\n[Chorus: WOLFE de M\u00c7HLS]\nHigh beams, high beams\nI'm tryna get the finer things (Yeah, yeah)\nHigh beams, high beams\nI'm tryna stay between the seams, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Outro: Big K.R.I.T.]\nThe neon lights in the trunk of the whip\nTell you how I feel sometimes, sometimes\nThe neon lights beneath the bumper and grill\nTell you how I feel sometimes, sometimes\nHigh beams, high beams, high beams\nHigh beams, high beams, high beams"}], "artist": "Big K.R.I.T."}
