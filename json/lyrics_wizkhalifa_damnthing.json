Not a damn thing, damn thing\nKeep it moving, I'm on over doing my damn thing\nKeep it moving\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou see I'm here now - that's right, you not the man\nThey say I spit coke, supply the block with grams\nAnd I ain't liftwaiting, I'm taking lots of grands\nCuz I ain't got patience, I'm not a doctor, fam\nMy niggas get it crunk, chump rep the side you from\nSmokin' somethin nigga, light ya blunt\nAin't got ya gun, you better find you one (why?)\nCuz this is Pistolvania - where them apes crawl\nBunch of shorties on the the corner, pocket full of 8balls\nAnd you never gonna see one of my niggas sleep\nUntil they cake long\nAye what you mean, man? Something like the Great Wall\nAs far as rap go, yeah, its in the bag\nOf course the haters wanna do me bad\nProlly mad because of the shit that I have\nI never let them slow me down, dawg, I'm living fast\nSo as long as the chick want to get with the young'n\nThat's all about making this cash\nI'm still a young'n, but niggas respect the flow\nAnd don't check me, ya better check ya ho\n\n[Hook]\nSee, we ain't worried 'bout a damn thing, damn thing\nHear you talking it, but you not about a damn thing, damn thing\nSo what you doing about it?

Not a damn thing, damn thing\nKeep it moving, I'm on over doing my damn thing\nKeep it moving\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm in the studio, making classic heat\nYou niggas mad at me, this cash I have to see\nAnd you chumps can amount out for the ones\nAnd I'm bout done with you punks\nAnd you clowns wanting to come for the crown\nI hear alot of talk, I gotta let them know\nI put the bussiness on a nigga, really think he feeling nutty\nWhen he come and try to test the flow (woah)\nCause I'm not for the games, opt you will not do a thing\nSee I was taught you gotta walk if you're talkin the same\nAnd its 4-1-2 til I fall to the grave\nThey'on know what to do with the boy to this day\nCause I'm always pimpin'\nIf I put my voice on track, the whole world gon' listen\nSome niggas might can hate, but you can say\nI get away with murder like O.J. Simpson\nI'm into all day grinding\nDon't nothing come easy, I'm putting the time in\nThe young'n keep rhyming\nSo that one day I can sit back and reclining\nI see you stressed out, man we do this shit for fun\nCall me the best out (why)\nKhalifa get it done (yes)\n\n[Hook]\nSee, we ain't worried 'bout a damn thing, damn thing\nHear you talking it, but you not about a damn thing, damn thing\nSo what you doing about it?
