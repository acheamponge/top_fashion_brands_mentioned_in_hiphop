Some of them feeling me\nAnd some of them be grilling me but\nI just blow my kush smoke up to the ceiling G\nYeah, and take a toke of the Swisher smoke\nThey got the paint and the brush, but not the picture, loc\nWhat is an emcee if he can't rap?\nJust a monkey with a mic just waiting to get slapped\nWhat is a DJ if he can't scratch?\nThe one rotten apple that's spoling the whole bag\nWhat is a B-Boy if he can't break?\nMight as well do the Dougie or even the Harlem Shake\nAnd what is a graffiti artist if he don't tag?\nNo homophobia, but he's a fag\nCause it's deeper than all that..\n\n[Hook: Bun B & Mac Miller]\nThe people think it's all about the fame\nAnd the money and the status and the game\nBut it's deeper than all that\nThey just want the women and the cars\nGetting high so they can chill with some stars\nBut it's deeper than all that\nThey thinking that it's all about the shows\nAnd the chains hanging down on your clothes\nBut it's deeper than all that\nWe're here to change the world with this thing called rap\nHomie, believe me, it's all that\n\n[Verse 2 - Mac Miller]\nOne time for the world cause we do it for y'all\nThat logo light up in the sky when the studio call\nMoving the crowd, get em loud without a gimmick\nSpit with a golden ticket, I'm whipping it up in minutes\nMy feet up in this game\nRapping even made a divot\nDon't worry about the critics\nIf it's happening now, forget it\nFor my heart is where I give it\nStay thinking about the future\nWhen I'm rich, I'mma call my mom before I call the movers\nThese haters are just losers\nHate to see you winning\nGave my all from the beginning\nI'm in it for extra innings\nHere to change the world like a change clothes\nWouldn't mind a little bankroll, pesos\nBut I\"m right here for way more\nWhat is somebody if they can't love?\nA hater.. someone give em a hug\nWe here to change the world with this thing called rap\nAnd homie, believing is all that..\n\n[Hook: Bun B & Mac Miller]\nThe people think it's all about the fame\nAnd the money and the status and the game\nBut it's deeper than all that\nThey just want the women and the cars\nGetting high so they can chill with some stars\nBut it's deeper than all that\nThey thinking that it's all about the shows\nAnd the chains hanging down on your clothes\nBut it's deeper than all that\nWe're here to change the world with this thing called rap\nHomie, believe me, it's all that", "year": "2011-10-14", "album": "I Love Life, Thank You", "title": "All That"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
