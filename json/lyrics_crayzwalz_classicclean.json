Life\u2019s an instrumental\nI walk crooked baselines with a straight pencil\nLead foot show you what I\u2019m into (Yo, yo)\nYou can\u2019t copy the form until I sell a stencil\nStrike drastic, write graphic, classic\nYou know the mathematic static in my Asia attic\nPragmatic, swift change and remain\nCreate fly shit, give birth to funky airplanes\nI\u2019m tranquilo but my rap steelo\nCould make me pull out mad metal like Magneto\nI might die quick in attempts to live long\nSo I got to come off every time I get on\nIf you see me drooling, I\u2019m thinking \u2018bout spitting\n\u2018Bout to smoke y\u2019all\u2014I should be quitting\nBut I\u2019m stupid\u2014I put Band-Aids on blood money\nMy girl got me on some Pooh-shit\u2014I love honey\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nClassic when I\u2019m kicking a flow\nClassic, never switching for dough\nClassic when I\u2019m ripping a show\nIt\u2019s classic, classic material\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nI got enough issues to start my own catalog\nAnalyze me as Allah in analog\nI ask about dinner during breakfast\nAhead of my time like a helicopter Lexus watch\nWe blow out the wind in trees, surfing a breeze\nWith condor feather skis.  Made from tough jeans\nLike leather Lee\u2019s.  Trick, please\nI make shells a part of your life forever like Run DMC\nIn divine order, I make mistakes on purpose\nWalk the lunar land, tag my face on the surface\nDance on tap water perfectly\nLike the spirit of Gregory Hines or mercury, certainly\nBeing too close to the Sun is urgently\nWorse than burnt toast.  Get blind when observing me\nYou don\u2019t like me?  Who cares?  I\u2019m the spit you fear\nMy presence alone could end your career for a year\nYou want to hear heat?  I\u2019ll take a dump in your ear\nBust a pump in the air, make clouds disappear\nNo mystery from Shaolin to Sicily\nTyson to Tiger Woods, I\u2019ll strike consistently\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nClassic when I\u2019m kicking a flow\nClassic, never switching for dough\nClassic when I\u2019m ripping a show\nIt\u2019s classic, classic material\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nThis for all my peeps who rock the permanent crease\nBrung shells out the house \u2018cause life was a beach\nDrink seaweed, eat rocks\nNo talk of diamonds.  I spit ice\u2014my shit\u2019s hot\nI\u2019m too/2 ill\u20141-plus-1 sick\nA smart guy who always did dumb shit\nSo get your script right.  Using my feet in a fist fight\nI\u2019m not pussy\u2014I don\u2019t care what you dicks spit like\nShooting arrows at charts, using bow-legged girls\nThen splash out like the king of Waterworld\nBeware of stitches in your genes/jeans like denim\nBefore I stab a track \u2018til it bleeds rhythm\n[?] was an X-Man before [rose-white streets?]\nBefore visions of rock raining on techniques\nI Rob Swift with beats with sinister [bees?]\nNow that the Sun\u2019s out, come on!  Total-eclipse me\nSome fold in they sleep, turn cold in the heat\nI stroll through the belly of the beast, holding my meat\nI rep MCs who sow what they reap\nAnd keep it funky underground like Ed Norton\u2019s feet (I\u2019m)\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nClassic when I\u2019m kicking a flow\nClassic, never switching for dough\nClassic when I\u2019m ripping a show\nIt\u2019s classic, classic material\n\n[Bridge (Overlapped with Hook Adlibs): C-Rayz Walz]\nR.C.P\nGreen Regime, T.O.P\nStronghold, NYC\nP-E-O-P-L-E Army\n\n[Outro (Overlapped with Hook Adlibs): C-Rayz Walz]\nYin and yang.
