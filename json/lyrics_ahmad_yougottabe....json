{"songs": [{"title": "You Gotta Be...", "lyrics": "(I used to be a stick-up kid)  --] Rakim\n\n[Verse q]\nEverybody in the ghetto tell me...\nIs it a lie that I must be a roughneck\nAnd wear a frown just to be down?\nI kinda don't agree with being (tough)\nBut you gotta be (rough)\nIt's either you claiming your hood, or you're not a gee\nForget about respect, I refuse to be the next guy\nFitted for a casket, either with it, or get blasted\nI choose to gang-bang, they give me a chrome-plated trigger\nSay, \"If you got any heart, go rob that Mini-Mart, nigga\"\nNow look what I done did, damn, I had to be the big man\nThey're looking at me shifty, better shut up 'fore I get slammed\nMan, I'm not a thief, good grief, and I don't wanna act hard\nBut then they said if I didn't do it, they was gonna gat, far\nAs I could see (I was gonna be)\nThe next new member of the crew, cause it's 8 of them and 1 of me\nI don't wanna do it, but I will\nCause I still want folks to think that I'm hard and tough\nCause you gotta be (rough)\nCause you gotta be (tough)\nCause you gotta be (rough)\n(I used to be a stick-up kid)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, it's the niggeroe, again, right back in where I left off\nStill trying to make a decision, I might go to prison if I don't step off\nBut if I don't rob this store, then I'm not sure\nIf I'm gonna be considered as a gee\nAnd you gotta be (rough)\nCuffs are temporary, homies are for life\nSo I grab the deuce-deuce and go inside\nI decide to prove in the Mini-Mart, \"Don't nobody move\nStart filling up the paper sack with loot, or I might shoot\"\nBut things didn't go as planned, cause this man had his own gun\nWe're standing toe to toe, eye to eye, so I figured why not\nPull the trigger? Put this nigga on the ground\nIt'll show that I had poise, then my boy'll know I'm down\nBut I didn't do it quick enough, or he thought of it first\nCause he blasted to the chest, and now I'm resting, yelling, \"Nurse!\"\nAnd holding on to life, or at least trying to hold on\nIn a jail-ward wearing cuffs\nCause I had to be (rough)\nCause you gotta be (tough)\nCause you gotta be (rough)\n(I used to be a stick-up kid)\n\nAnd everybody, everybody gotta be rough, y'all\n(I used to be a stick-up kid)\nAnd everybody, everybody gotta be tough, y'all\n(I used to be a stick-up kid)\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, that's the end of my tale, but before we know\nFools'll just forget what I said, and the story go\nOn and on, until you're up to no good\nAnd back throwing up your hood\nAnd still doing what you shouldn't\nNiggeroes, come together, cause divided we fall\nSo stall that gang shit, stand up\nQuit standing in handcuffs\nReally hard's when you got loot\nAnd you ain't gotta shoot\nDamn man, enough is enough\nSo why you gotta be (rough)\nCause you gotta be (tough)\nCause you gotta be (rough)\n(I used to be a stick-up kid)", "year": null, "album": "Ahmad", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3d85c954b2ab0c9abe8f9fc12381fbd7.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Ahmad"}
