'til you feel weak\nYeah then you shake it, 'til you can't take it\nIf you get tired move around and fake it\nAnd stop....and do a dance or two\nSo everybody in the place can get wild\nWith to the program, this is a show-jam\nAsk me to stop, and I'll say \"no ma'am\"\nTell the DJ to turn it up a little louder\nMake the crowd and party people take a shower\nAnd the music, I can use it\nMake you wanna go and jump through this\nAnd get busy...cause I know what's up\nEverybody in the place you gotta get on up\n\n[Chorus]\n\nYo, maxin, nah no time for relaxin\nJust get into the floor instead of waxin, the sound\nNo time to sit down...\nYou have to get up so you can get down\nLet yourself go, get into the flow\nAs Arab makes this a hype show\nFrom intro to intro you know\nThat the size of the crowd will grow, large\nThat's the kinda life I'm livin\nThat's why I try to keep givin\nSomething new for you to try to dance to\nWork your body 'til the song is through\nJust flex it all the way up to the exit\nBut don't stop there cause next is the chorus\nYeah there's more of this, so you know what's up\nYou gotta get on up\n\n[Chorus]", "year": "1989-11-28"}]}
