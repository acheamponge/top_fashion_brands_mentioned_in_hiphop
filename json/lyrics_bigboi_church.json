What the meanin to all of this?\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nSometimes life can keep you down, with your face all in the dirt\n(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)\nNow if you feel that left behind, need to get up and go to church\n(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)\nOoooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh\n(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)\nOoooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh..\n(HALL-LE, LU-JAH)\n\n[Verse One: Big Boi]\nBig, slide into the mode, time to drop a load\nMy life is going downhill like some cardboard in the snow\nMy bank account is frozen, I\nDon't think that I can get out this hold\nFeel like the figure four leglock\nLike the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked\nI can't move, I can't eat, I can't even breathe\nCan't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds\nNo trees, no P's to ease the stress of everyday living\nBut homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they living\nThe unforgiven or the unwilling, live a life of sinning\nAnd expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginning\nBut\u2014what about repentance?\nWhat about detention?\nWhat about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?\nWhat about repentance?\nWhat about committing the same sin\nOver and over again and again and ah..\n\n[Hook - singers]\nWhy are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?\nPlease tell me - what are we here for?\nOW!\n\n[Verse Two: Big Boi]\nLife, is nothing but a dream, so peaceful and serene\nUnless you're being evil then you on the devil's team\nWide receive what you want to believe\nBut soon you'll have to sew those bad seeds\nPlease, any man can ask to get a pass\nOr a cleansing of sin to grant another chance\nPerhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel\nTalk to the coach or break out the huddle\nWhatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle\n'Cause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible\nAs you survey the syllables and sentences\nThe question that I'm merely trying to pose is as simple as me saying\nWhat about repentance?\nWhat about detention?\nWhat about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?\nWhat about repentance?\nWhat about committing the same sin\nOver and over again and again and ah..\n\n[Hook: Sleepy Brown]\nSometimes life can keep you down, with your face all in the dirt\nNow if you feel that left behind, need to get up and go to church\nOoooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh\nOoooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh..\n\n[Hook - singers]\nWhy are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?\nPlease tell me - what are we here for?\nOW!\n\n[Breakdown]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/547d6239cd014bda1acb0078d0ddaafc.999x999x1.jpg", "year": "2003-09-23", "title": "Church", "album": "Speakerboxxx"}]}
