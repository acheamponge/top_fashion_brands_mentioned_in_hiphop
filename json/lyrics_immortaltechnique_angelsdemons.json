I see you standing over the grave of another dead President\n\n[Hook: Bazaar Royale]\nI see angels above me\nDemons below me\nFighting over heaven, heaven, heaven\nIt's real\n\n[Verse 1: stic.man]\nAmerica's nightmare; young, black, and just don't give a fuck\nRun up in the courtroom and wet 'em up\nGot nothin' to lose but my handcuffs\nEvery man must choose to lay down or stand up\nIt's war time, everything is fair, no fear\nWhen they say the homie murdered the judge, I don't care\nFuck 'em, he deserved it, long as the homie get away\nAnd don't get caught for the crime, I encourage it\nWe rootin' for the villain in black\nPourin' out Absolut, salute, niggas is shootin' back\nIn self-defense we bang the pistol like\nLarry Davis or Brian Nichols\nEvery pig, every public official, the boomerang\nIs coming back to get you, you reap what you sow, did you?\nThe system you created created a monster\nAnd now you scared 'cause it's coming back to haunt you\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 2: M-1]\nSince we gonna take the blame, I'mma rep my name to get my aim right\nLet's have an overthrow and after party in the same night\nSame height as Huey, same muscle build as Malcolm\nWith the same circumstances in the hood, you know the outcome\nAnd read it in the news about your sergeant and your captain\nDon't take this as a warning, just another nigga rappin'\nFuck the way we organizing, fuck the training and the grapplin'\nAnd fuck them Uncle Toms who call police because we smack them\nAnd fuck you sympathizers with your middle class reactions\n'Cause we bangin' on the system, G'd up, fuck the factions\nAnd if you didn't know, the G was for George Jackson\nAnd long live his warrior spirit packin' the Magnum\nWatching over the soldiers, knowin' niggas be blackin'\nWhen we really need to be disciplined in our ways and actions\nWhen we get some freedom you niggas can start braggin'\nTill then, inside the blood of my eye, you see the dragon\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]\nI'm like the birth of baby Mohammed, the movement I started\nCan spar with the hardest, the martyr regarded as Spartacus-hearted\nIt doesn't matter whose missiles can shoot the farthest\nWhen you're a target in an Afghan Teutoburg Forest\nClose quarters combat over corrupted elections\nBilderberg is like cancer, it grows an infection\nNepotism is the gold and the conductor's connection\nAnd ignorance is the prison that the people are kept in\nThe military ain't there for the people's protection\nThey're just there to protect an investment\nThat's why people get arrested, electrocuted, molested\nConnected streets are infested with those tired of protestin'\nTraumatized children grow to guerilla garrisons\n9/11 generations pale in comparison\nAnd you will learn a lesson repeated through history\nThat no matter what you think, occupation is not victory\n\n[Outro: Immortal Technique]\nSomalia, Kashmir\nNigeria, Palestine\nIraq, bring it back\n\n[Hook x2]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d17ee30cab427a6ea7fa3bfa64561580.400x400x1.jpg", "album": "The Martyr", "year": "2011-10-27"}]}
