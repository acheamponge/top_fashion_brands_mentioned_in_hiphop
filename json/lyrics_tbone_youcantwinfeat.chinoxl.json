Chino XL)", "lyrics": "I'm so dope I'm impressing myself\nChallenging rappers of my status dogg is bad for your health\nIt's like swallowing rat poison straight of the shelf\nOr slitting your wrist then changing ya mind\nBut ain't no one around to help, dudes hear spit they like holy Toledo\nCuz when it comes to this rapping, I'm the one like Neo\nI'm Jackie Chan, bet a hundred grand I could take out five of ya man's with one wave of my hand\nYour whole caravan get smacked right in front of ya fans\nI'll have screaming \"No Mas\" like Roberto Duran holla\nThey call me Boney Soprano, Young Luchiano, Bone Guevara\nRaps Sammy the bull Gervano, I'm sick wit tha flow\nLyrical tactics and back flips, spitting ridiculous mathematics\nLike it's gymnastics, when I die, be sure to place in my mic in my casket\nAnd tell the world that I was fantastic, and that's it!\n\nChorus\nYall can't win, against us\nIf you try, we will bust\nYou should know, we're the truth\nYou can't do, what we do, oh\n\nOpposing me could be detrimental like a skinhead wit a confederate flag\nWalking through south central, it's suicidal like Kirk Cobain\nTrapped in a thunder storm using God's name in vain, ouch!\nYall ain't really ready to riot wit me, I'm the Rocky of rap retiring rappers like Jay-Z\nThe Ronald Reagan of rapping yo that's me\nI been rocking and running this rap game, Chino\u2026"}], "artist": "T-Bone"}
