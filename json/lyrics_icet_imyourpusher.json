Let the record play\n\n[Bridge]\nAww man, I like this dope here man\nIt's feelin' alright boy\nWhat you say your name was man?\n\n[Hook]\nI'm your momma\nI'm your daddy\nI'm that nigga in the alley\nI'm your brother when you need\nA true player to emcee\nYou know me, a true friend\nYour main boy, thick and thin\nMC Ice-T\nI'm your pusher\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know you're lovin' this drug as it's comin' out your speaker\nBass thru the bottons, highs thru the tweeters\nBut this base you don't need a pipe\nJust a tempo to keep your hype\nGroovin' like I see you doin'\nSome stupid crack would just ruin\nYour natural high, why? .. That ain't fly\nAnd anyone who says it is, lies\nMove like I knew you would, like I knew could\nAnd if you ain't cracked out, then I know you should\nBe able to give me a clap, to match exact with the track\nAnd since I know that you ain't, I expect that\nOh now this jam is lit, it's like the ultimate\nPeople high off dope but still physically fit\nI'll make a million bucks, pack my dough in trucks\nFrom sellin' dope beats, dope rhymes, dope cuts\nI'll be the biggest dope dealer in history\nBecause all the fly will be high off that Ice-T\n\n[Bridge]\nAww man, you ain't ever lie man\nThis dope's alright man\nI gotta get back with you man\nLet me get your number man\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'll bring it to boil, Evil E rock it up\nYou want it? ...
