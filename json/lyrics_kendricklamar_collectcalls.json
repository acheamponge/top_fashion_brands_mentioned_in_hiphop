G-O-D\nNo, it's not neglect-ion, I have just accepted\nYour fate and what its gon' be\n'Member all the nights that I cried\nThinkin' that my only son just died\nPeeking through the window, kickin' through the door\nIt's you they looking for, raid outside\nRather see you locked up than dead\nOnly you would say that I'm selfish\nSo before I take the stand and put this bible in my hand\nSon, let me say this\n\n[Hook]\nMen lie, wo\u2014women lie\nMen lie, wo\u2014women\nMen lie, wo\u2014women lie\nMen lie, wo\u2014women\nLook at all the bullshit I been through\nIf I take you home, will you tell the truth?"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
