You got your father\u2019s nose\nYou got your father\u2019s eyes\u2014a nice surprise, that\u2019s the part that glows\nCan\u2019t wait to watch you grow\u2014so much I can\u2019t sit still\nCan\u2019t wait to teach you to fly a kite and ride a bike without them training wheels\nYou\u2019ll see some things that\u2019s real.  Life\u2014it can be so cruel\nBut I\u2019ll be right there every step of the way\u2014yes, baby, I promise you\nI\u2019ll be the dad that mom wasn\u2019t.  Gotta be responsible and I does it\nIn the hospital, the chord\u2014I cut it.  The more I live it, the more I love it (What\u2019s that?)\nIt\u2019s fatherhood.  Do everything that a father should\nPromise to raise you well from through K through 12, then you run off to college\u2014good\nAnd if you happen to come home from prom late (What?!?)\nYou know daddy gonna pick up your prom date\nAfter he swear on his life he [?] get a kiss, I\u2019mma hit him in his lip and I\u2019m straight\nYou got your father\u2019s cheeks.  You got your father\u2019s feet\nI know you got your father\u2019s heart, so it\u2019s the hardest beat\nI wanted a boy, but you came.  But no pleasure measure the joy you bring\nI wanted a boy, but you came.  But no pleasure measure the joy you bring, Rayne\n\n[Chorus \u2013 Lokz]\nRain on me\nThere will be sunshine\nJust rain on me\nI\u2019ll be there for you\nJust rain on me\nWait for the sunrise\nThe rain\u2019s gotta fall\u2014I\u2019ll be there through it all\nThe pain\u2014I\u2019ll be right by your side\n\n[Verse 2 \u2013 Lokz]\nApologize.  I\u2019m caught up in my ways\nBut I just gotta hustle babe\u2014so you don\u2019t have to\nSo many things that I\u2019ve been tryna change\nSo I can be the man you look up to\nYou might not be aware\n[?]\nI\u2019ll show you I care\nWhen someone breaks your heart, I\u2019ll be right there\nIf they try to hurt you, just remember: ain\u2019t no man who deserve you\n\n[Saigon]\nI\u2019mma be the only man you need, baby girl.

I need for you to know this now\nI\u2019ll rap, rob, shake, bake\u2014whatever it may take to hold us down\nAnd it might sound clich\u00e9, but I\u2019m loving you much more each day\nEven though me and mother don\u2019t click, if it benefits you, I\u2019ll do whatever she say\nThat\u2019s fatherhood.  You my proof that God is good\nAnd when the day turn gray, I ain\u2019t staying away\u2014I\u2019m just praying to God it would\n\n[Chorus \u2013 Lokz]\nRain on me\nThere will be sunshine\nJust rain on me\nI\u2019ll be there for you\nJust rain on me\nWait for the sunrise\nThe rain\u2019s gotta fall\u2014I\u2019ll be there through it all\nThe pain\u2014I\u2019ll be right by your side", "album": "Warning Shots 2"}], "artist": "Saigon"}
