I'm getting mine\nI take trips and dips just to recline\nI blaze up the orange weed\nTo relax my mind\nSpend time with my kids on the weekdays\nAnd I holla at my momma and my\nGrandma on the threeway\nShe say, If you do right\nBaby boy I promise you live\nA long life\nI can't argue\nI try hard to\nNot blast niggas\nI walk past niggas\nWith my head up to the skedai(sky)\nNigga tried to pull a fast one\nOn Snoop Dogg\nTo get some shut eye\nWhat I do to him I can't speak\nYou know the episode\nAnd the code on the street\nI keep it all the scriffin' y'all\nBut real street for y'all\nCause you never know\nWhen you're gonna go, no\n\n(Chorus)\nYou never know where this road's gonna take you\nGot to be strong\nYou got to hold on\nCause you never know, where\nThis life's gonna lead you\nJust Hold on\nYou never know\n\n(Warren G)\n]From the killing\nThe robbing\nThe squabbing\nAnd jacking\nCar jacks to kidnaps\nWhat? Niggas be acting a fool\nTrying to set me up at the park\nBut I'm cool\nAct a fool\nMy daddy said throw them thangs\nAnd stay strong\nMy momma got sick\nSo I'ma keep it strong\nAs long as I got my feet in the game\nAnd make this beats\nAnd bring heat to the game\nFuck the fame\nI got a little boy to see through\nAnd him without me\nIs like me without you\nKeep it true\nAnd stay down for your grips\nHomies and licks staying tight\nLike this\nYou never know\n\n(Chorus)\n\n(Phats Bossi)\nYou niggas never know\nWhich man are blasted for\nNever know which man to kill\nJust to settle the score\nIt wasn't long ago\nI had this partner of mine\nKnew him just a short time\nBut he's stuck in my mind\nMy nigga lived perfect\nSaid the streets wasn't worth it\nIf you don't die rich in the game\nThen what's the purpose for this struggle?\nWe stay piece to puzzle\nInvest half the wealth\nAnd pray to god it double\nWe just in this\nTrying to get rich at the interest\nKeep it pimping\nStay with niggas that's relentless\nSmoke dough\nJust because I say so\nMoney pronto\nAnd niggas never would know\nThey never know nigga\n\n(Chorus til fades)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d6de5cd1db4247b2c70ed9ed284be9e9.220x219x1.jpg", "album": "I Want It All", "title": "You Never Know"}]}
