If I don't rip it you consider me wack\nI'm on top of the fucking game, so ya'll do better than that\nBut I think they cakin', runnin' late, they takin' bricks\nBefore you think or ever blink\nI'll be off up in your place\nPut that heater to your face and tell you 'lead me to the safe'\nDon't cooperate that caution tape will cover up your place\nThis is all bets nigga on that muthafuckin' Ace\nThat is I, greedy guy, run up in and take your pies\nIf you niggas wonder why, look into my fuckin' eyes\nNever wonder whats in mind\nGive you just a bit of time\nI am starving you fuck niggas outta your mind\nFuck yo problems\nFuck yo momma\nFuck yo baby momma drama\nFuck yo sister\nFuck yo daughter\nWhen you fuckin' with the devils, we are rebels\nHear the tremble when you walk over them pebbles\nWear them guns like they a medal bitch\nI heavy medal, handle-grip, word shop like it's a sander\nI'm 100 and loaded like a muthafuckin' Rambo\nMake you scramble from this ammo\nThat I put off in this hammer\nBitch it's hammer time\nYou asinine, no mastermind\nAnd half the time, I'm over-time\nAnd after mine there will be none\nAnd if there's some they runnin' from me half the time\nYes I am a problem\nI be wildin', I be smilin'\nWhile I'm asking for your wallet\nWhat you drivin'? Give me diamonds\nAsk your lady she desire me cause I'm fly as any pilot\nQuitted college just to follow me to sight see on an island\nI am G-U-T-T-A, put this base up in your face\nUntil you feel the b-b-bass, from this k-k-k-kay\nI am runnin' in your place\nIt is I, yes Ace Mr. H double O-D\nMister get you in your sleep\nMister see me in the streets\nBitch I'mma a mutherfuckin' beast\nI never sleep, I just go eat\nAnd if I hear of any beef, and then I wanna little piece\nJust let me get a little piece\nI walk your block and hit your streets like I'm a mutherfuckin' G\nA matter fact I am a G\nAnd you a P-U-S-S-Y\nAll you niggas said I couldn't and I told you to your eyes\nBitch I'm on some murder mind\nAnd bitch I'm on some other grind\nYou can't compare me to your kind\nJust listen up and wonder why\nYes I am blind to you niggas rappin' with no passion\nCan't imagine ever yappin'\nI be rappin', spittin' magic, let you have it\nNow let me breathe and let me free you some satisfaction\n\nHuuuhhh\n\nLike I told you niggas before, see I be in and be back\nI'm like an energizing bunny with no energy pack\nFuck lettin' you niggas go breathe you can swallow the track\nOr you can swallow all them hallows that inserted the gat\nAnd see I gave you won't fold now I'm back in your chest\nIt's all bets on the next nigga show me your best\nAnd next time I come around have that cheque and the cash\nJust tell them niggas Khaled they should put it all on your man\nYeah, put it all on your man\nOctober 14th, I'm taking all bets in advance\nGUTTA", "image": "https://images.genius.com/59c6a5d95d46cd7d40db52a0b93e26c2.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
