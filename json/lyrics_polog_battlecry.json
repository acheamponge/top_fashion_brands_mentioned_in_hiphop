My shorties eager to tighten your screws\nThem blickers go off like alarms, but you ain't wakin' up if you snooze\nNiggas be clowns, puttin' on shows for the media, I don't be shit but amused\nI won't forget 'bout that lil' shit you said, we gon' get you for frontin' your move\nMy shootas some hell-raisers, come through clappin' broad, they don't give a fuck 'bout the rules\nI played the block, went on them drills by my lonely, I had the four-oh up in school\nFightin' anxiety so I kept spendin' my last on all of the drugs I abuse\nDown on my ass, they ain't give a fuck about me, I felt like I ain't have nothin' to lose\nNow I'm in my bag, just tryna run up these millis 'cause I ain't got nothin' to prove\n\n[Chorus]\nI know these niggas never been a hundred, they let that fame switch 'em\nDid all that preachin' 'bout bein' solid, then you changed, nigga\nI'm from that 1300 block, I'm still the same nigga\nThey know how I bleed, swear this shit up in my veins, nigga\nI looked my brother in his eyes, I seen the pain in 'em\nBoy, I won't play, I'll go to war about my gang members\nI was in the trenches slidin' with them grave diggers\nChopper showers, he gon' fall once that rain hit him", "year": "2019-01-28"}]}
