A whole list of things\nAnd I think that it's a shame, that I don't get to see you enough\nAnd I been trying to make you mine for at least a few months\nYou steady running through my mind, so what's keeping you pumped ?\nAnd as for them pumps, it's really bringing out the way that you strut\nLike, who wouldn't want a girl with elegance, intelligence\nAnd a cute way of presenting it?\nI see where your potential is\nAnd I know that even with or without me, you'll keep on ascending\nLet me tune into your spiritual channel\nMy sleeping beauty all alone in her castle\nYou're golden, glowing through shadows\nCupid got his bow and his arrow when I throw in the towel\n(i'm losing the battle)\n\n[Hook]\nRelax yourself girl, please settle down\n(I'm not saying you should let us in\nI'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)\nRelax yourself girl, please settle down\n(I'm not saying you should let us in\nI'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)\nRelax yourself girl, please settle down\n(I'm not saying you should let us in\nI'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)\nRelax yourself girl, please settle down\n(I'm not saying you should let us in\nI'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)\nRelax yourself girl, please settle down\n(I'm not saying you should let us in\nI'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)\nRelax yourself girl, please settle down\n(I'm not saying you should let us in\nI'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)\nRelax yourself girl, please settle down\n(I'm not saying you should let us in\nI'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)\nRelax yourself girl, please settle down\n(I'm not saying you should let us in\nI'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)\n\n[Verse 2]\nStill better my days, by drawing hearts around my Es's and J's\nAnd thinking bout' you when I get on the stage\nYou're a lot more mature than the women your age\nAnd I really don't expect it to change\nSo take this as a token of my loyalty\nIt started with a blueprint, now I need a supporting beam\nWay before the contracts, you saw a lot more in me\nI can't define it metaphorically\nYou're like a diamond in the rough or the lighter to my dutch\nThat was blunt, but I can't lie you firing it up\nAnd by myself it's hard for me to face it\nAll I need is patience to help keep this flame lit\nAnd that look in your eyes is pretentious\nIt's no strings attached, so why less affection\nAnd we both trying to find some reception\nI got you unlocked, don't hide this connection\n\n[Hook]\nRelax yourself girl, please settle down\n(I'm not saying you should let us in\nI'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)\nRelax yourself girl, please settle down\n(I'm not saying you should let us in\nI'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)\nRelax yourself girl, please settle down\n(I'm not saying you should let us in\nI'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)\nRelax yourself girl, please settle down\n(I'm not saying you should let us in\nI'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)\nRelax yourself girl, please settle down\n(I'm not saying you should let us in\nI'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)\nRelax yourself girl, please settle down\n(I'm not saying you should let us in\nI'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)\nRelax yourself girl, please settle down\n(I'm not saying you should let us in\nI'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)\nRelax yourself girl, please settle down\n(I'm not saying you should let us in\nI'm just saying let your guard down a little bit)"}]}
