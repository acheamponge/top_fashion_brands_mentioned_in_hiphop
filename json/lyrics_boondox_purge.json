I want them all dead\n\n[Hook: Jamie Madrox]\nI will rid the world of all the hatred\nBy hating harder than anyone did\nThey keep me from trying to have a great life\nThey're always having me pulling my [?] away", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e8156b5abe6d6da62f135b01f8bad398.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
