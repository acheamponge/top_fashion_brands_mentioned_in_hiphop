(Went out and told)\nNiggas say they down to ride, but be folding like clothes (Folding like clothes)\nPurple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul (Ain't trusting a soul)\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Skies]\nI roll up the Mary Jane, no, they can't feel my pain\nI'm still trapping everyday, I think I'm stuck in my ways\nIf you looking for a handout, get the fuck out my face\nI don't care about no friends because they all were just fake\nIn my inbox like I owe you, I got this by myself\nI was broken down bad when you said you would help\nNow I'm up, they love to hate me, that's just bad for your health\nAnd she say she a college girl, but left her books on the shelf\nShe gon' fuck me like a porn star, a rock star\nTryna skrrt off in that fast car, like NASCAR\nGirl, you know I got a cold heart\nIf I would give it to you, would you tear that shit apart?\nRed roses on my grave, bury me with art\nAnd with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark\nMidnight rider, never put the car in park\nI'm shining bright just like a light 'cause I came from the dark\nI ain't never had nobody, put that on my mommy\nI might have to catch a body if you try to stop me\nShe ride like a Kawasaki, yeah, she like it sloppy\nOh, you got a hottie body, come ride on my Johnny\nI'ma go show you the wave, just give me some space\nWhy you all up in my face like you need a taste?\nGood designer on my waist, shooters keep the K\nI tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave\nI ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding\nI'm never lying, was never crying\nTake flights I'm flyin', no, you can't see me\nSay you need me, but you deceive me\n\n[Chorus: Lil Skies & Landon Cube]\nAnd I got all the drugs in the world that you need (World that you need)\nWe get high to pass time, but bitch, I ain't no fiend (I ain't no fiend)\nI got money on my mind, I be stackin' my green (Stacking my green)\nShawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease (Dripping with ease)\nPlease don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased (Like to be teased)\nSay she got that super soaker, well, girl just let me see (Just let me see)\nI ain't worried 'bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me (Ain't scaring me)\nI was destined for this life, it's in my destiny (My destiny)\nFriends wanna be friends when you doing the most (Doing the most)\nHow you tell me you my bro then you went out and told?
