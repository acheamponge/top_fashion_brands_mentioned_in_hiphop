Lil' Mo\n\n[Verse 1]\nUh, Uh, Uh\nBaby girl\nYou know my situation\nAnd sometimes I know you get impatient\nBut you don't put on a show to get ovations\nTake it to court and go through litagations\nAnd I respect you gangsta\nTreat you like a princess\nAnd put something on your neck to thank you\nShe's my pinch hitter\nWhen the startin lineup ain't playin right\nI come off the bench with her\nIt might sound like I'm gassin you\nBut it take time to get from the back seat to the passenger\nWe been creepin and sneakin\nJust to keep it from leakin\nWe so deep in our freakin\nThat we don't sleep on the weekend\nWifey's a little bit uptight\nWonderin why I keep coming home in the middle of the night\nIt'll be alright if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight\nBut I said it'll be alright\n\n[Chorus]\nI really wanna be with you (be with you)\nBut I gotta be real with you (real with you)\nI can't leave you alone (no)\nAnd I know I'll live in wrong\nBut I can't let you go\nYou're the one I want in my life (want in my life)\nI already got a wife (got a wife)\nI can't leave you alone (no)\nAnd I know I'll live in wrong\nBut I can't let you go\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou ain't never step out of line\nOr get out a pocket\nSo I made sure canary sent out your locket\nTo protect you I'll get out and cock it\nAnd you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket\nOh, you gone play dumb if cops do come through\nI gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through\nBut I know the boutiques and the shops you run through\nSo I cop her one and cop you one too\nYou always get a daily page weekly ring\nPlus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things\nI ain't gotta put a band on your finger\nOr worry about you tellin the whole world I'm your man while I spring her\nAt first you was somethin I denied\nSomething I would slide\nJust to do somethin in the ride\nBut shorty\nThere's something you provide\nCause the entre ain't as good without somethin on the side you know?\n\n[Chrous]\n\n[Verse 3]\nUh\nUh oh, I might be leavin the earth soon\nMy girl gone kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume\nIt's gonna be a clip tossed if I go back\nWith stains of your lip gloss on my throwback\nShe won't care if I'm a platinum rapper\nIf she catch me with an empty Magnum wrapper\nSo keep it on the down low call the car celly\nYou seen what happened with Mr. Big and R Kelly uh\n\n[Lil' Mo]\nYou know I care for you (care for you)\nAnytime this chick is there for you (there for you yea)\nThese feelings I'm a share with you\nWhich makes it a little more clear for you\n\n[Chorus to Outro]", "title": "Can\u2019t Let U Go"}]}
