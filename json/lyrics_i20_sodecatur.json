Eastside hoe we back on the grind\nIf I'm in the trap I like to pack a mack or a 9\nIn '94 I'm sellin' bass, in a place called spanish trace\nIn a second you can vanish, dead and gon' without a trace\nI caught my first case, for boomin' out the back of south deca'\nMan I wouldn't be caught there without a Z atleast a half\nShit I had to be fresh, they had the T's on friday night's\nAnd if the car ain't got no shoes, I can't say I'm ridin' right\nI had this trick, out in Eastwick, who turn tricks and suck dick\nAnd when I went to see her, I would always have a full clip\nScottdale bitch, one been through some rappin' lands\nMr. Coug' a damn shame, call the twins from jagged edge\nAnd I will rep the D.E.C., til' it ain't no breath in me\nWhether Glenwood, Rainbow, Flexo's or Macavee see...\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so Decatur\nI'm so Decatur\nI'm so Decatur\nI'm so Decatur\n\n[Verse]\nYeah, I talk that dope slang folk, rock and dust\nTreat my hoes like my pistols, cock and bust\nYou better study hip-hop, if you think someone else\nCould spit the game so trill and get they shit off the shelf\nNiggas think they so fire, well I'ma full alarm blaze\nSet ya braids on fire, til' they burn to a fade\nThis that eastside shit dog, let it be known\nAnd our hands in all the car folk, nothin' but chrome\nIt's all stuntin' in the Dec. dog that's rule #1\nYa see more niggas touchin' rims then a game of 21\nAnd I'm so slum with it, my roots are du' deep\nI'm so street if I get shot I'd probably bleed concrete\nTake a second, swallow what you heard\nTry to understand while they follow every word\nWhile they put me on a pedastile and worship what I say\nI-Dub out that eastside and this is how we pray, say ugnhh!\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so Decatur\nI'm so Decatur\nI'm so Decatur\nI'm so Decatur\n\n[Verse]\nI-Double, I'm straight out the Dec., no one is better\nNiggas claim I changed my style, but I only changed the letters\nFrom BMX to BMW, AK's to MP's\n.OZ's to ASCAP, the BUS to SUV's\nBitch please, I'm from Atlanta where we brawl and we fight\nWhen you ever heard me rhyme and it was only aiight\nI ain't shit, but I'am the shit, you do the math\nThis ain't a clip, it's a full clip, move or get blast\nThe only one that could be king, cause I do it for real\nDon't believe me we can hit the deck and do it for real\nPretty thugstyle, got these bitches kissin' us off\nFake rappers sound like bad blaoww's, pissin' me off\nInfamous, I'ma icon, ain't no endin' me\nCall Chaka all you want, and you still won't be D.T.P\nBasically y'all faggots, cause you do it and run\nAin't no killa's on the payroll cause we do it for fun, folk\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so Decatur\nI'm so Decatur\nI'm so Decatur\nI'm so Decatur", "image": "https://images.genius.com/90e0bb9a0154e50e44a296a498644f13.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "Self Explanatory", "year": null}]}
