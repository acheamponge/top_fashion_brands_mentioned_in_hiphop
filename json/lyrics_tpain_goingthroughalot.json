(What'cha know?)\nIt's alright, and I paid the price, but still I'm goin through a lot\nSittin on the block now (through a lot)\nSlangin out my drop now (through a lot)\nNobody's helpin me, whether they see it or not - goin through a lot\nI'm hatin on the cops now (through a lot)\nWishin they would stop now (through a lot)\nNobody's helpin me, whether they see it or not - goin through a lot\n\n[T-Pain]\nAll this music got me goin crazy, can't even concentrate on my family\nBut I still gotta do it\nPlus I gotta go through all this family hatred\nI don't know why everybody's hatin me\nBut I still gotta do it\nEven one of my homeboys thankin that I'm bangin his lady\nI don't know why he would think that out of me\nBut he gotta go through it\nTo all the nappy heads I got you baby, we 'bout to make it yes indeed\nAnd we gon' get through it\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bone Crusher]\nI work a 9-to-5 shawty and they think it's funny\nAnd how they feel that my stress don't count homey\nI hit the beat like a cop when I hit the block\nBecause my baby's gotta eat, I ain't gon' never stop\nI see them laughin at me fo' cause my pants raggedy\nAnd my do' won't shut and my car's shaggy\nBut I see the future man like I'm Nostradamus\nAnd in my heart all I see is a future star\nBut in my brain ain't nothin but these notes man\nBut y'all don't feel my stress y'all don't UNDERSTAND~!!\nThe next step is the pistol and it goes down\nMellow it out fat boy, just calm down\nAnd sing this song.. and sing that song\nCause God gon' make a way for me to get my hustle on\n\n[T-Pain: repeat 2X]\nGoin through a lot; sittin on the block now (through a lot)\nSlangin out my drop now (through a lot)\nNobody's helpin me, whether they see it or not - goin through a lot\nI'm hatin on the cops now (through a lot)\nWishin they would stop now (through a lot)\nNobody's helpin me, whether they see it or not - goin through a lot\n\n[Outro]\nGoin through a lot, through a lot, through a lot\nGoin through a lot, through a lot, through a lot"}], "artist": "T-Pain"}
