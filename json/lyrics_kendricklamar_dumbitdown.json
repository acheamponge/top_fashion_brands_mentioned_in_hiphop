I\u2019m cool like that\nOh, you spit? Well the retarded drool is back\nSee, I\u2019m the author of the authors, the father of the Austin Power fajja\nWho can bust like a charter, why bother?\nI know a jealous serpent is a burden to my life\nBut still I carry on like luggage on a flight\nThe realness in my bones is the DNA to life\nI can give you insight only if you\u2019re in sight\nI\u2019m looking past y\u2019all like a fastball - strike!\nAnd I ain't even tryna give it my all - yikes!\nI\u2019m comfortable enough to go and chill out with a Huxtable\nYou couldn\u2019t see my pedestal, because you\u2019re afraid of heights\nCloud 9, where you can find\nMe in my dime like Roosevelt in his prime\nWait 'til I\u2019m in my prime\nThe moon and the stars will align on my Louis V. belt like Orion\nTo whom say he cool: but the irony is I could hold the bottom of an iron with the bottom of my palm\nI say so much, so little all action, no talk like a mime throwing up gang signs\nIt\u2019s not all about punchlines, I don\u2019t do that\nI\u2019m a Jaguar; you\u2019re just a new cat, now move back\nKendrick Lamar on the radar for success\nAiming for the top like an AR aimed at your neck\nI can never digress, \u2018less I get demoted to death\nEven then I\u2019ll be the best still, like a petty theft\nI will: conquer my biggest dreams\nOnce you open the cage, I bet that I\u2019ll spread my wings\nNipsy got street cred, Jay Rock got street cred\nAnd all I got is bad credit, big ears and big head\nBut still they\u2019ll feel me, cause we all ate cereal\nHumped our momma's friend's daughter while they bump the stereo\nBackflips on shopping carts, free lunch at the park\nWatched Power Rangers after school; here we go\nI\u2019m so Comptonized, I will never compromise\nFor no faulty ass A&R or CEO\nWe ain't what you think and you think we\u2019re back\nBut we\u2019ve been here for decades, and I vouch for that\nOpen your mouth for that, speak well like a great debater over iChat\nGet your other eye cracked\nI don\u2019t rap, I-Iraq and declare war\nI enjoy watching enemies' blood pour\nI came up lower middle class, not poor\nSo don\u2019t feel sorry for me, I don\u2019t need y\u2019all to love me\nI need y\u2019all to feel me\nAnd if you feeling froggy to leap, then feel free\nMy feeling\u2019s all aside, my pride is deprived\nBy the ultimate prize I'mma get when I see your suicide"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
