You will die! One by one we will take you...on\"\n\nWe place ourselves on pedestals\nShe loves me not my petals stole\nA head so full of ghosts that if I open it I'll let \u2018em go\nSeppuku left em so the exit wound\u2019s impeccable\nGet so Heavy headed, heaven knows this is my hecatomb\nDevil boy l second guess my efforts til the echoes roam tremolo\nMy temper trembles slow temperatures are ten below\nTentacles attach to temples for mementos\nSipping soma melanomas slowly growing on my mental\nDefend my territory kill \u2018em like a teratoma\nMurder like its Terror Firmer Troma\nCombing through this Terra Firma\nTear through derma circa circumventing\nPersons of a certain setting\nI'm acerbic like a serpent I\u2019m a servent\nCome behead me\nAny minute ima murder my reflection\nIf looks could kill I'd burn the ones who turned in My direction\nDon\u2019t try me I\u2019m a daily chore\nDying for the sake of war\nMaybe I\u2019m just paranoid but I see 1984\nInside my mind let's take a tour\nA thousand miles away from shore\nAll my words are made of oars\nMetal in my veins they're made of ore\nOr I'm a bore I'm so ugly I'm abhorrent\nI'm aborted boars chewing on my corpse\nYo I\u2019m rigged with rigor mortis stored in a morgue of the tortured\nImmortalized my scorn born on a scorched earth\nTorrential downpours pouring on our pores\nI\u2019m porcelain\nSomebody should have hung me in that orchard\n\nHOOK:\nKerosene dreams on the things that I\u2019ve seen\nTear off my wings then they tariff my screams\nCareless all weak they don\u2019t care if we bleed\nKerosene dreams please bury me deep", "album": "Salo Sessions II"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
