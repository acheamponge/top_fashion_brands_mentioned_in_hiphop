[x3]\nI gotta get it\nGirl you gotta grind\nI'mma put it down, gotta get mine\nBut you gotta get it, girl you gotta grind\nI'mma put it down, gotta get mine\nGotta get mine, gotta, gotta get mine\nI'mma put it down, gotta get mine\nGotta, gotta get mine, gotta, gotta get mine\nI'mma put it down, I gotta get mine\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm on the road to success, I strive to be the best\nI never settle for less, if I'm broke I can't rest\nA hustler in the flesh, and I'm smokin on the best\nCause I deal with lots of stress, out here in this paper quest\nI'm makin progress, so I'm blessed, oh yes\nAnd I'mma get it to my last dying breath, then its in peace I rest\nI'm working with that bread like a chef when he cook\nNow I'm back to flippin paper like I'm reading a book\nStaying real with your partners that's a real good look\nBut when your cash stash low all your boys get shook\nI been searching for that paper like its Natalie Holloway\n8 days a week, plus I grind on holidays\nThere ain't no excuse for these boys to be broke\nI know some hustlers in wheelchairs, we get it til we croak\nFrom south pole, to south Post Oak, I gotta stack them C notes\nSo listen up close\nSay I gotta get it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI gotta get them dollar signs, all of every kind\nPartner, I need mine; even them nickels and them dimes\nI'm out on the grind, stingin every lick I find\nGo & get it myself, there ain't no time to stand in line\nI never fall behind, and yeah I'm full of that purple slime\nBut I ain't dead yet, I'm just fine\nI'm still in my prime, so I pack at least a nine\nCause these haters trying to block my shine like mini blinds\n(I gotta get it)\nLong as opportunity knock, I'mma get that guac\nAnd give it all that I got until my coffin drop\nThe sun rise, I'm the first hustler on the block\nAnd when the sun set, I'm still out here on the clock\nI'm trying to hustle for them tickets, like a traffic cop\nI gotta hustle and get it partner, I never stop\nI take that paper real serious, like Dwight Schrute\nStacking up loot all around the 610 Loop\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI know the world in a recession, but I'm still progressin\nTake heed to my confession, never fall to oppression\nI learn from life's lesson, if you keep on pressin\nYou'll eventually end up on top like salad dressin\nI'm never second guessin, I abide by faith\nAnd however long the race, gotta maintain pace\nWhen the haters fall to waste and my God grant grace\nNo matter what odds I face, I'mma be in first place\nThey hustlin in haste to feed expensive taste\nBut me, I gotta grind out there on that paper chase\nThey turn they back on clements, but I'm still gon ride\nToo many fish up in the water trying to float with the tide\nNo matter how high the gas price, I'm still gon drive\nQuite crying and complaining, partner, swallow your pride\nWhile you blaming everybody for your same bad luck\nI'mma be on the come up, sun-down to sun-up\nI gotta get it\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2009-05-12"}]}
