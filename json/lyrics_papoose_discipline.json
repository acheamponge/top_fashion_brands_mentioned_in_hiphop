Okay then\nNext time you run in this house, you better stay in (That's right)\nChildren are not allowed to say the word liar\nThat's a curse, you get burnt, you play with fire\nBetter say your grace before you bite into that food\nTake your hat off in the house, I hated that rule (Haha)\nSomebody in the streets hit you? You better hit 'em back\nIf they bigger than you, pick up somethin' and give 'em that\nBullyin' was unacceptable, wasn't this soft\nIf you don't kick his ass, your mama gon' kick yours\n\n[Chorus]\nMama used to take me across her lap\nShe used to whip me with a strap when I was bad\nI didn't know at the time being bad could lead to crime\nBut now I'm glad\n\n[Verse 2]\nBack in the days even the fans was loyal, stuck with our team 'til they made it\nNow y'all switch teams every time LeBron get traded\nAppreciate the tough love 'cause it advanced us\nWithout that we probably wouldn't've been Black Panthers (True)\nPerhaps our sisters would have been lap dancers\nAnd when they put us to the test, we won't have answers (Damn)\nBefore you walk in, wipe your feet on the welcome mat\nDisrespect this house, you not welcome back (Nope)\nYou failed this time? Next time do it better\nSnitchin' wasn't a go, you couldn't be a tattle-teller (Facts)\nYou said, \"Thank you, you welcome, excuse me\"\nApologized if you handled things rudely (Humble)\nWhen grown folks is talkin', don't say a thing\n'Cause it takes a whole village just to raise a king\nI can't believe y'all impressed by these weirdos\nAttention seekers dressed in expensive sneakers and weird clothes\n\n[Chorus]\nMama used to take me across her lap\nShe used to whip me with a strap when I was bad\nI didn't know at the time being bad could lead to crime\nBut now I'm glad\nMama used to take me across her lap\nShe used to whip me with a strap when I was bad\nI didn't know at the time being bad could lead to crime\nBut now I'm glad", "year": "2019-02-15"}]}
