I forget his name, but he was a little Guyanese kid. He knew one of my mans on the street, and was like, \u201cYo I know so-and-so!\u201d And I was like, \u201cAight, wassup.\u201d\n\nSo he was cooking and he was like, \u201cI want to show you how to make this shit.\u201d He was right about it being \u201cshit.\u201d It\u2019s called Prison Surprise in most prisons, and inmates modify it however they want. So I tried it, and it tasted like shit. Then I went to lay down and go to sleep hours later. All of a sudden I was feeling nauseous.\n\nI was like, why am I feeling so fucked up? I started sweating, like I was sweating bullets! I\u2019m like yo, what the fuck? Why I\u2019m sweating like this? Then I just started throwing up. I ain\u2019t know what was wrong with me, but I figured something must have been in that food I just ate. I caught the ill food poisoning or something real quick, yo. So I threw up like three times, and then they took me to the infirmary and just gave me an IV. That was my first day there!\n\nAt that point, I was like, I\u2019m never eating somebody\u2019s creation ever again. Don\u2019t make me nothing. A lot of people fuck with prison surprise. I\u2019m not one of those people. But if you wanna be stupid enough to try it, I have the recipe for you.\n\nP\u2019s Don\u2019t Try\nThis At Home\nPrison Surprise\n\u2022 Ramen noodles\n\u2022 Doritos (you could also substitute with Cheez-Its or sliced cheese)\n\u2022 Jack Mack (tuna works fine too)\n\u2022 Hot sauce\n\nOpen the can of Jack Mack, and rinse the fish off gently. Take a bowl of water and microwave it for a minute or until it boils. Throw in Ramen noodles and stir it. Grab the chips and crush them up until they\u2019re a fine powder and mix them in with cooked Ramen noodles. It\u2019ll make like a cheese sauce. Throw in the Jack Mack, and then you eat it. Good luck, yo.\nFrom commissary kitchen: my infamous prison cookbook published by Infamous Books.\n\nYou can download the audio version of commissary kitchen: my infamous prison cookbook for free on Amazon", "year": null}]}
