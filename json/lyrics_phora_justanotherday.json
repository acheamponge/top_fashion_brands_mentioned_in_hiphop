Naw, I've hit the bottom before\nI remember sleeping my niggas Honda Acurd\nWe get sick of dealing with all the problems of course\nEverytime I try to ignore, shit I thought of it more\nBut that's just another day I stay content with the sour\nSo I'll bow my head & pray for a better tomorrow\nYeah, it's just another day, I stay content with the sour\nSo I'll bow my head & I'll pray for a better tomorrow", "year": "2012-08-12"}]}
