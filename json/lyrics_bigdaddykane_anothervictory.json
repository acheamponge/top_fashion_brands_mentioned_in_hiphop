It's time to unite along\nThe righteous with a walk in success and be strong\nInstead of lookin' for someone to beef with\nA brother like the Big Daddy Kane is peace with\nRappers of today like (Kid'N'Play)\nHey, even my man LL Cool J\n(Stetsasonic) and EPMD\nPublic Enemy and (BDP)\nSalt 'N' Pepa cause we can't sever, never\nWhether, whatever, we better stand together\nThat means unite, not fightin' or fussin' or cussin'\nSave all the base for the pipe and start lovin'\nOne another cause separation is a flaw\nSo endure for more and stop lookin' for\n\n[Hook]\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory\nAnother victory", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e5112b31d8bd715b9e736175eff672d9.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "1989-09-19", "title": "Another Victory", "album": "It\u2019s a Big Daddy Thing"}]}
