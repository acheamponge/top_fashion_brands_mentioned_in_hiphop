Kelly\nI got more connections than illegal selling microchips\nTo hunt you down after I destroy the mic when I spit\nImmortal Technique bitch!\nI'm a real lyricist\nOther people just use Jay-Z as their ventriloquist\nNow run and tell your boss, you mothafuckin' snitch\n\n[Verse 2: D. Rymz]\nMost cats can't remember me cause my brain shaking energy\nMentally hitting victims so hard they lose they memory\nAnd generally, you'd rather go to hell than be my enemy\nYou're meant to be with a foot in the chest, there's the penalty\nDivide then mutilate drum beats\nBefore I touch a MC in the cypher, I lubricate the tough piece\nSpin against his Earth till' his reality's reversed\nSo when he spits his best verse, it comes out as his worse\nSo life begins in a hearse and ends it with birth\nSo everything that he hate, he loves until it hurts\nMy logic is sick\nAll you chumps gotta get sticked\nHot as the clip that was dipped up in the bottomless pit\nWith knowledge equipped\nI thieve on the foolish\nReason I knew this\nJesus and Judas, Caesar and Brutus\nDavid Goliath, I'm seizing Divine\nYou heathens are blind\nBe warned, I storm like all four seasons combined\nCarve your extremities like mob in the Genovese\nHeat the part of the brain in charge of the memories\nDudes done forgot how we starved in the 70's\nSons continuing wars\nOur fathers were enemies\nIn these dark spots the Don bomb like the Lebanese\nThe wicked trying to replace God with celebrities\nYou heard me\nThe wicked trying to replace God with celebrities\n\n[Hook x2]\nToo real\nToo fake you trying to be\nMy powerful words something you ain't trying to see\nA real lyricist, in depth, so honor me\nI am what you not\nI'm an anomaly", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1-immortal_technique-20101005.Jpg", "album": null, "year": null}]}
