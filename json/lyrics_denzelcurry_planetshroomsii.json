The Reaper]\nFrom where the slogan was survive in Atlanta that holds the zone of war\nMore killas bribe with contraband, but they playin' Contra, fuck around\nTryin' to meet the next level and minimize the coppers\nThe CPU and cheat codes won't work\n20 years old can't afford a lawyer, momma said he should've went to church\nStop by, I'm smokin' in another universe\nAs my whole planet gets worse, I'm blasted if I could rule the world\nOn my way back to Earth\nAnd see all of the out of the day gloomers\nInter-galactic storm troopers keepin' my brothers captive\nSo don't ask me if I believe in magic\nIf I answer, I say it only exists in drugs\nAnd god is a mirror cause his image is in us\nHoly water drippin' down her body hurry up get a cup\nDown a [?] in panties hopin' that she wasn't naked\nSame outfit as Eve, I'm not Adam, but I'm still sacred\n\n[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]\nHe slit the adam's apple and now it's forsaken\nThe [?] basic, all medication, civilization is pagan\nBefore we built the pyramids, hieroglyphics outdated\nTextin' on the iPhone and 95 works slated\nIsraelites in a modern day Babylon\n[?] but cannot live in the sun\nBefore explain to me how we not the chosen one\n7 stars in my hand, and a blade on my tongue\nWhether a god is a profit, illusion optic\nClocks stop it, had to pause it, fundamental brain deposit\n[?] project, cause science is not a conscience\nPut in logic, no emotional [?] shit\nHoly as the cross that Jesus walked in, to the Crossroads\nI don't see no Bonethugs, all I see is Thugbones\nStone cold the pegasus is arson\nRadiate flows like sippin' water out the faucet, bitch\n\n[Verse 4: J.K. The Reaper]\nCustom plated and put it in a scribe\nIf we start a revolution, it needs to be televised\nBut it will be only for the viewers that's watchin' with open eyes\nI despise you critics that interfere with your lies\nI'm on an acid tab havin' intercourse with the sky, fuck the world\nI'm gonna elevation the minds, fuck the world\nAnd I'mma fuck it till it's mine, fuck the world\nAnd I'm fuckin' till it's mine"}], "artist": "Denzel Curry"}
