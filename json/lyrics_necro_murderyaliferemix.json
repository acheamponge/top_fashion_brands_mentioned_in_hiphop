Can't come back ever again\nYou better get used to it, and make the devil your friend\nPsycho-logical where it's logical to be a psycho\nAstronomical with a rifle blasting at you if your ass is comical\n\nI always feel like somebody's watching me\nAnd I have no privacy\nWoh, I always feel like somebody's watching me\nAnd I have no privacy"}], "artist": "Necro"}
