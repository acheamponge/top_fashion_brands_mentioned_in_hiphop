Last night when I saw the video of Alton Sterling being killed it left me feeling disheartened, emotional and truly scared. I woke up this morning with a strong need to say something.\n\nIt's impossible to ignore that the relationship between the black and brown communities and law enforcement remains as strained as it did decades ago. No one begins their life as a hashtag. Yet the trend of being reduced to one continues.\n\nThis is real and I'm concerned. Concerned for the safety of my family, my friends, and any human being that could fall victim to this pattern. I do not know the answer. But I believe things can change for the better. Open and honest dialogue is the first step.\n\nMy thoughts and prayers are with the Sterling family and any family that has lost someone to this cycle of violence.\n\nBe safe out there. More life."}]}
