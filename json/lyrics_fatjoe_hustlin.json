Don't be caskets and clothes\nC'mon y'all know niggas slip, speakin a joke\nThere go the dial tone, click, now you steamin with holes\nY'all motherfuckers couldn't fathom what's about to go down\nLike a year from now, when the bears get out\nFrom a ten-year stretch down to air shit out\nMake him a man, show your heart when I tear it out\nThey say hustlin is the key to success, and on that note\nI can feed you niggas for less, I got mad coke\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Fat Joe]\nYeah, it's for all my hustlin niggas\nAll my liquid dime niggas\nAll my niggas flippin bricks out there, yeah\nAll my niggas in the Columbia brother suits\nIn the pourin rain, tryna get your shit on\nSmokin the C.I. in the rain, y'know?
