City where it's gritty and groggy\nWe still get that Cash Rule, windy or foggy\nSnowy or breezy, for me it's so easy\nTo move on up like George and Weezie\nJust looking out of my window, watching them ask for dough\nCan It Be All So Simple, I'm getting paid for my flow\n\n[Chorus]", "year": null, "title": "I Will Rise", "image": "https://images.genius.com/af61f0ef977c2f691226fe0ab315bfd9.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
