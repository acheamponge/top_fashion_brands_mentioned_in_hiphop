(Boy)\nYeah, I hustle 'cause I had no choice\nThey rather that I had no voice, voice, but instead\nMy parents held perspective for the mislead\nCigarettes and baby mama's that sip Henn\nWhile the weight of the world gets heavier\nBorders where they try and build barriers\nTalkin' here, buildin' hysteria\nThat's why my young niggas don't care enough\nWe\u2019d rather rock diamond wristwear and a pair of Buffs\nThey\u2019d rather have us locked down in a pair of cuffs\nUnfair fair enough\nI wonder why you never see no peace\nWhy my outfit's not low-key\nTreat foreign whips like trophies\nBelong in this world\nBut we have to make our own in this world\n\n[Chorus: Sam Austins & Black Milk]\nThey told me shootin\u2019 for the stars was the answer\nYeah, I took a trip to the stars, no rocket fuel, no NASA\nBlack astronaut, tell me, what more could you ask for?\nThe path wasn't never there\nIt's one my niggas had to build everywhere, yeah, yeah, yeah\n(Yeah, yeah)\n\n[Verse 2: Black Milk]\nThose days that'll make you wanna shout\nThirteen, had to be the man of the house\nMan or a mouse? Money was the path we was after\nThings took a pass, had to grow a little faster now\nCold-hearted was the outcome, middle finger to ones\nPointin\u2019 fingers that never been where I'm from\nWe was all trapped in, shit\nWhy you think we was all strapped then?\nHead in the clouds, yeah, you deserve it\nYou would proably see a star if you looked a little further\nLife's like a jump off the edge\nHope my wings form 'fore this fall ends\n\n[Chorus: Sam Austins]\nThey told me shootin' for the stars was the answer\nYeah, I took a trip to the stars, no rocket fuel, no NASA\nBlack astronaut, tell me, what more could you ask for?\nThe path wasn't never there\nIt's one my niggas had to build everywhere, look\nThey told me shootin' for the stars was the answer\nYeah, I took a trip to the stars, no rocket fuel, no NASA\nBlack astronaut, tell me, what more could you ask for?\nThe path wasn't never there\nIt's one my niggas had to build everywhere\nYeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah"}], "artist": "Black Milk"}
