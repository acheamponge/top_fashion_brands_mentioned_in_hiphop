January 29th we arrived at the hospital\nJanuary 30th the baby was born\nTears of joy, me and your mother we cried\n22 hours of labor, never left her side\nI was there every second, every minute, every hour\nEvery step, every breath, every word the doctor said\nYour mamma having a fit when I'm pushing her legs\nBut I was so excited when I seen the hair on your head\nThis is it, the moment of truth, your finnaly here\nI don't know how I should feel, all I know is im scared\nDoctor Lou was there and both of your grandma's where there\nAnd we all cried as you arrived with open eyes\nBut you couldn't breathe properly because of the cord\nSo she handed me the sciccors, and your daddy I cut\nThat was what's up, what a hell of a night\nI'm so proud I completed the circle of life, and your here\n\n[Hook: Lee Wilson]\nCircle of life you opened my eyes and now I see light\nMy love, my heart, and so you are the sunshine\nBecause of you now I chose to live life right\nYoooouuuuu are my sunshiiine\n\n[Scratches by DC]\nJaz-O & The Immobilarie - Love Is Gone\n\n\"Ayo nothing I hear greater than being called a daddy\"\n\n[Termanology]\nUh my baby, I really can decribe on a track\nThe way that I feel for you, cuz it's deeper than that\nIt's love, but your mommy doesn't have it for me\nAnd thats hard, but it really doesn't matter to me\nAlong as I'm here for you I'm gonna make things right\nI'm gonna teach you how to read and how to say things right\nEducation is a must ain't no takin' the bus\nOn the highway of life, i'll teach you to fly right\nI'm gonna teach you about honor, and teach you about trust\nTeach you about love, and teach you about lust\nI'm gonna teach you self defence incase you get tested\nCuz kids are cruel and they ain't got affection\nAnd alot of people envy when you got nice things\nLike chains and rings and diamond ear rings\nAnd your only 4 months, so imagine in time\nWhen your only 16 with a car like mine\nAnd it's hard, trying to raise a woman being a man\nBut this one thing I promise that I will not fail\nAnd I swear on everybody that's related to you\nFrom your pops, baby this is dedicated to you, your my love\n\n[Hook + Scratches]\n\n[Termanology]\nI promise your first christmas I'm gonna be there\nI promise your first birthday I'm gonna be there\nAlong with the rest, your father was blessed\nSometimes I can't believe that your part of my flesh\nYour beautiful just like your mother is, only your pure\nYour like the sun, moon and the stars, only your more\nAnd it's hard, baby I got a career and it's raw\nAnd sometimes I gotta tour just to open up doors\nBut I swear i'd rather take care of you and be poor\nThan to be rich rich without you, and your belly is sore\nAnd maybe one of the reasons that your mommy's so ill\nCuz she never had a daddy, but I promise you will\nAnd I'm gonna be your best friend, not only your pop\nSo if you ever got a problem you can call me and talk\nI was lost, until you showed me the light\nAnd I'm dedicating my life to raising you right, your my love\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Lee Wilson]\nOhhh Aaliyah\nBaby girl you are my sunshine\nOhhh Aaliyah\nBaby girl you are yeah\nYou bring me joy in my life\nOhh Aaliyah\nYou gotta know daddy loves you\nYour my baby girl\nYou are my joy, my joy\nOhhh daddy loves you"}], "artist": "Termanology"}
