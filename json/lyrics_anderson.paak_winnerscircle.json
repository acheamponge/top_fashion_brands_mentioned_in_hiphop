I had my three when I was sixteen\nThat happens, what are you gonna do?\nMaybe she's your first great one\nThanks a lot, Sonny\nI think I'm gonna go for one\n\n[Verse 1]\nThis is not some super conventional\nExtra slick talk meant to convince you all\nMaster classes reduced to simple form\nThere's nothing formulaic about it\nThis, more that\nPapa told you only open the door if he opens it first for you\nMama, sit down, help me get through\nIs this how you felt on the day you found it?\n\n[Chorus]\nBeh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo\nOh, oh, ooh\n'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool\nBeh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo\nOh, oh, ooh\n'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis is not some take you out for lunch\nWine and dine you and cha you on counter tops\nFill your mind with cotton candy hearts\nWhat's the odds you stay a while?\nThis, more that\nGet to know me, kiss me slowly, hard to focus\nThey just don't make 'em like this no more, whoa\nBut I think I've found it\n\n[Chorus]\nBeh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo\nOh, oh, ooh\n'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool\nBeh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo\nOh, oh, ooh\n'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool\n\n[Break]\nCha, cha-cha-cha\nBah-bah, bah-bah-bah-buh-bah\nBah-bah, bah-bah-bah-buh-bah\nBeh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo\nOh, ooh\nBah-bah, bah-bah-bah-buh-bah\n\n[Bridge]\nSomebody go (Somebody go)\nSomebody go (Somebody go)\nSomebody go get me\nI'm 'bout to go (I'm 'bout to go)\nI'm 'bout to go (I'm 'bout to go)\nI'm 'bout to go in deep\nThat's not what I thought it was\nBut it's more than I bargained for\nSomebody go (Somebody go)\nSomebody go get me sober\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah\nThey gon' have to come for me\nCame out my comfort zone to be amidst your company\nSomethin' about the way you never gave it up to me\nBut let me know that I can get it  any day of the week\nIf talk is cheap, well then, I'm broke\nWith both hands on the sweeper, cleanin' up dirty secrets\nTold you don't ever give me that gushy, but I didn't mean it\nBring her home and I'ma bust it out the residence\nWhen I get the gushy, I go dumb like the President\nYes, lawd, I'm way up, word to Sacagawea\nIf the gushy was a sneaker, it'd be moccasin trainer\nIf the gushy wasn't so sweet, I could save it for later\nBut every time I fuck with someone else, I wish you was there\nKinda douchey I know, how the fuck I get here\nI got hoes, I got hoes, we don't need to go there\nOn my way out a zone, somebody gon' give me body\nPick my feet off the floor, boy, I think I'm fallin'\n\n[Chorus]\nBeh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo\nOh, oh, ooh\n'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool\nBeh-doop-boop-cha-ta-pah-dey-dah-doo\nOh, oh, ooh\n'Cause if I know I can get it, then I've already had it, I'm cool, cool"}]}
