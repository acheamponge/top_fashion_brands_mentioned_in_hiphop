(Haunt)\nI know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\n\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nTell me what you gon' do to me\nConfrontation ain't nothin' new to me\nYou can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue\nBut you can't bring the truth to me\nFuck you and all your expectations\nI don't even want your congratulations\nI recognize your false confidence\nAnd calculated promises all in your conversation\nI hate people that feel entitled\nLook at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you\nOh, you important?\nYou the moral to the story? You endorsin'?\nMothafucka, I don't even like you\nCorrupt a man's heart with a gift\nThat's how you find out who you dealin' with\nA small percentage who I'm buildin' with\nI want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'\nOn my momma, that's the realest shit\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nLove, let's talk about love\nIs it anything and everything you hoped for?\nOr do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)\nI know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nLove, let's talk about love\nIs it anything and everything you hoped for?\nOr do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)\nI know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
