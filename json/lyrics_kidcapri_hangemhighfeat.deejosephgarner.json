Kid Capri?\n\n(Verse One)\nHang 'em high, let him suffer, before he die\nCause in my mind I see that little girl cry\nShe was abused, misused, and even sodomized\nShe didn't know - all of this was a surprise\nSo now she's scarred for life, nothin can change that\nBeing treated like some dog by some maniac\nWhat type of man would want to do that to a six year old\nOut of all of these women that the world hold?\nYou coulda went to a nightclub and met a chick\nBlack or white, Puerto Rican, you coulda picked\nBought her a drink, took her home, and maybe got some\nBut you'd rather rape a baby and you think it's fun?\nNow you're goin to jail, death row I hope\nBefore the rope when you get there, your boots'll smoke\nI got somethin, to say to ya before ya die..\n.. hang 'em high\n\n(Verse Two)\nMy name is Kid Capri I wanna say this to y'all\nAny man that rapes a woman is not a man at all\nEspecially a little girl that don't know nothin about that\nRape, man you're a maniac\nSo now you're locked in a cell, what good are you now?\nNo friends, no freedom, and no style\nWord to duke you're gettin stuck like a blister\nJust for instance, that coulda been my sister\nOr my moms, my girl or my daughter Lou\nBe glad the cops got to you before I got to you\nIt's a shame for a girl to be so scared\nThat when she walk down the block, her life is dead\nCan't jog down the street, after dark\nTake a look at what happened, in Central Park\nA girl is runnin, while some bum is bummin\nThe only thing he's thinkin about is cumin\nHe gets his rocks off, now he feels like a man\nThen he kills her, and steps off, but understand\nWhat goes around, comes right back around\nAnd when he's found, he's gonna get a beatdown\nHe tried to skip town, headed for the Northbound\nGot no money so he steals and gets shot down\nBut don't die, so now it's gonna get rougher\nBefore you execute him - LET ME SEE HIM SUFFER\nGive him the chair, shoot him down, let him die\nBetter yet, huh, hang 'em high..\n\n(news reporter)\nThis just in - police officials report\nThat the suspect in the rape of a six year old girl\nHas been apprehended, and has confessed to this outrageous crime\nLet's hope they really hang this guy\n\n(Kid Capri)\nKid Capri, Silver D and Money Mark - hang 'em high!\nOut! {*echoes as it fades*}"}]}
