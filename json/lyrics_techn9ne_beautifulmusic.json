You gotta live it to give it\nI'm giving you me, if you wanna quit it, I dig it\n'Cause I get a pussy pass every minute, but then it's\nA fight 'cause you thinkin' I'm all up in it, we finished\nNow we diminished, I get it\nSee the obstacle then you really admit it\nWithout knowing I ever did it you split it\nI was real and don't you ever forget it\nYou bit-itch!\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nNow I can paint a beautiful picture\nBut you won't want to look into it\nI can make beautiful music with ya\nBut you won't want to listen to it\nNow I can paint a beautiful picture\nBut you won't want to look into it\nI can make beautiful music with ya\nBut you won't want to listen to it\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nBaby, this is something that you never knew\nInstead of me, you being with a regular nigga might be a better view\nI know I got a lot of cheddar, true\nBut a nigga with hella time in your bed is who?\nYou should be putting way up on a pedestal\nYou being super happy with him instead of blue\nBut you wanna see shit that you never seen\nMy dick is feeling like you taking methamphetamine\nThat's why when I'm calling your phone you never let it ring\nEven when he's sitting next to you I bet it sting\nYou wanna ride it your hide is divided\nBy my two thumbs, I murder it when I get inside it\nHit it 'til you get it, then get the itis ignited\nWhen you tripping, you can't fly with the pilot?\nI can paint you a beautiful picture\nBut I think it's better when you got a dude with you\nSitting at home, but then you got a true fixture\nYou fucking perform because he got it through scripture\nI'm a compatible nigga to every woman with incredible figures\nTattoo my dick on him, is that a new stigma?\nIf you say that then music I ain't gotta do with ya\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nNow I can paint a beautiful picture\nBut you won't want to look into it\nI can make beautiful music with ya\nBut you won't want to listen to it\nNow I can paint a beautiful picture\nBut you won't want to look into it\nI can make beautiful music with ya\nBut you won't want to listen to it"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
