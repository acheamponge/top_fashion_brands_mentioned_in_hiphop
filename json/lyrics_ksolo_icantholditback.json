You must be drinkin St. Ide's\nI'm back in effect on my second cassette\nCheck the untouched rep, scarin emcees like a bomb threat\nRumors and lies, at the same time try to destroy my name\nIs this the price for fame?\nIf people got money, for rumors and talk\nThey'd have a lot of millionaires livin here in New York\nThree number one hits, should kill the negative vibe\nSolo's name and fame could never be denied\nIt's got me trapped in a corner and I wanna attack\nI tried to hold it in before but now I can't hold it back!\n\n(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)\n[K-Solo] I can't hold it back\n(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)\n[K-Solo] I can't hold it back\n(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!

Let it go Solo!)\n\"K-S-O-L-O\" \"No longer a fugitive\"\n\nVerse Two: K-Solo\n\nI wrote 'Spellbound', to put my face on the map\nBut rumors have it that another man laid in jail wrote\nThat's impossible, Kevin Madison will take a stand\nIf he wrote 'Spellbound', who the hell wrote 'Letterman'?\nMission to make the non-believers there become a witness\nWhen I release the hit, \"Tell your moms ta mind her bizness\"\nIt went number two, not far from number one\nWhile the fugitive ran, I came back, to get the job done\nNow they wanna tell lies, and take credit from a great\nHard working Solo artist, but this'll set em straight\nI came back for ninety-two on a Sam Sneed track\nI tried to hold it all in, but now I can't hold it back!\n\n(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)\n[K-Solo] I can't hold it back\n(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)\n[K-Solo] I can't hold it back\n(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!

Let it go Solo!)\n\"K-S-O-L-O\" \"No longer a fugitive\"\n\nVerse Three: K-Solo\n\nCops won't arrest me, before, but now I'm on a tour\nSo what they knockin at my mother's door for?\nThe cash made I received, the money I was worth\nBut Solo couldn't change, cause I was taught first\nTo remember who you are, and where you come from\nIt won't be hard for you to become, number one\nI don't like crowds around me ever, only a true friend\nCan become an enemy so I stay Solo forever\nI like it that way, but I hate when people say\nPut me down on their record, so I can get paid\nIf I bring crews and other emcees on stage\nAnd help everybody else, I never stay paid\nSo I write rhymes for Solo, and help myself\nSo when I get there, I can give another brother help\nKevin Solo demonstration left others and that's that\nI tried to hold it in before but now I can't hold it back!\n\n(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)\n[K-Solo] I can't hold it back\n(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)\n[K-Solo] I can't hold it back\n(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)\n[K-Solo] I can't hold it back\n(Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo! Let it go Solo!)\n\"K-S-O-L-O\" \"No longer a fugitive\"\n\nVerse Four: K-Solo\n\nNow I got a new album, and a tape and a CD\nAnd those who thought I fell off were really surprised to see\nK-S-O-L-O throwin down and all the rumors\nAnd the lies that they were spreadin couldn't keep me down!\nBack out my face, keep my name out your mouth\nThis record got your cornered and there's no way out\nSolo killed all the rumors cause I had to attack\nI tried to hold it in before but now I can't hold it back!\n\n(Let it go Solo!
