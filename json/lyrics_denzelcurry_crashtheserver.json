Denzel Curry) \u300cCrash The Server\u300d \u6b4c\u8a5e\n\n[Intro]\nUh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh\nUh, uh, uh\n\n[Verse]\nProphet Ezekiel, AKA the prophecy\nI had to give you my government so you'd know me properly\nSee this is my property, yet the system don't give a damn\nTake Mars, remove the S, spell it backwards, I'm a ram\nThis the jam\nSee, everything is hot on this desolate planet\nThe type to put your satellite through some permanent damage\nNo diagnostics, all your drawers need to see a mechanic\nDamn, we can't manage\nMan, we can't vanish\nI can't speak robot, but I can speak Spanish\nSeems a lot of real music has been forever banished\nEvangelists of the sonic revival\nFrom trip-hop into tribal\nNot a fight over music, this is my fight for survival\nHow many robots?\nHow many rebels?\nHow many lighters?\nHow many levels?\nHow many monkeys?\nHow many barrels?\nLeft in peril\nDeath isn't the only thing that scares you\nToast to life\n\n[Chorus]\nDrop the crack, start a riot\nFlood the planet, be a tyrant\nPaint the streets, crash the server\nExpress yourself, always be the converter\nDrop the crack, start a riot\nFlood the planet, be a tyrant\nPaint the streets, crash the server\nExpress yourself, always be the converter\nDrop the crack, start a riot\nFlood the planet, be a tyrant\nPaint the streets, crash the server\nExpress yourself, always be the converter"}], "artist": "Denzel Curry"}
