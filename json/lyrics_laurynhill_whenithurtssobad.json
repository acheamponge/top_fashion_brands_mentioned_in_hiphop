(when it hurts so bad)\n(When it hurts so bad)\n(When it hurts so bad)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI loved real, real hard once\nBut the love wasn't returned\nFound out the man I'd die for\nHe wasn't even concerned\nI tried, and I tried, and I tried\nTo keep him in my life (to keep him in my life)\nI cried, and I cried, and I cried\nBut I couldn't make it right\n\n[Chorus 2]\nBut I, I loved the young man\nAnd if you ever been in love\nThen you'd understand\nThat what you want might make you cry\nWhat you need might pass you by\nIf you don't catch it (if you don't catch it)\n(if you don't catch it)\nAnd what you need ironically\nWill turn out what you want to be\nIf you just let it (if you just let it)\nIf you just let it (if you just let it)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSee, I thought this feeling\nIt was all that I had\nBut how could this be love\nAnd make me feel so bad? (gave up my power)\nGave up my power\nI existed for you\nBut who-ever knew\nThe voo-doo you'd do\n\n[Chorus 2]\nBut I, I loved the young man\nAnd if you ever been in love\nThen you'd understand\nThat what you want might make you cry\nWhat you need might pass you by\nIf you don't catch it (if you don't catch it)\n(if you don't catch it)\nAnd what you need ironically\nWill turn out what you want to be\nIf you just let it (if you just let it)\nIf you just let it (if you just let it)\n\nSee what you want might make you cry\nWhat you need might pass you by\nIf you don't catch it (if you don't catch it)\n(if you don't catch it)\nAnd what you need ironically\nWill turn out what you want to be\nIf you just let it (if you just let it)\nIf you just let it (if you just let it)\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)\nWhen it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)\nWhy's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)\n(When it hurts so bad)\n(When it hurts so bad)\n\nWhen it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)\nWhen it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)\nWhy's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)\n(When it hurts so bad)\n(When it hurts so bad)\n\nWhen it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)\nSo bad (when it hurts so bad)\n(When it hurts so bad)\n(When it hurts so bad)"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
