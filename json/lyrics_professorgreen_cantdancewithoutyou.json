OK, I'm lying\nI don't know the name of the song that I'm raving to\nA raving loon, as long as I've got music\nI'll be raving until I chafe my gooch\nI already saw the chick I wanna dance with\nAnd I've been aiming when to make my move\nJust when I went to move on it\nA man popped up but I ain't too bothered\nBecause I make legs spread like the Bubonic plague\nCome on babe, I know you want it, ayy\n\n[Pre-Hook: Professor Green]\n\n[Hook: Whinnie Williams]\n\n[Bridge: Professor Green]\nNo pics or I'm posing a threat\nLook at my boat, it's a mess\nAlthough right now I'm in the zone and I'm bless\nYou can bet by Tuesday, I'll be an emotional wreck\nAll alone in my room with the lights out\nWatching a rom com and crying my eyes out\nWondering why I bother with you\nI wanna quit, it's just I can't dance without you\n\n[Hook: Whinnie Williams]\n\n[Outro: Professor Green]\nIf I'm being honest, I can't dance at all, init\nI've got two left feet\nI can sing though, trust me\nNo autotune needed\nYou always have this special way\nOf making life feel-\nAlright, maybe not", "year": null}]}
