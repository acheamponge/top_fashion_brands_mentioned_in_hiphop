Tell me, how are you sad?\nYou got all of these friends, you got all of these fans\"\nI ain't trust nobody new since 2012, I ain't let nobody in\nJesus got killed for our sins, Walter got killed for a coat\nI'm tryna cope, but it's a part of me gone\nIn this packed room I'm alone\n\n[Chorus: Saba and Daoud]\nI'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away\nI seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe\nI'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away\nI seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe\nOhhh, ohhh\n\n[Verse 2: Saba]\nI'm so alone, just me and my girl\nShe leave me for work, then leave me for school\nShe finally home, I leave her for tour\nFaceTime me nudity, yeah, all of this new to me, yeah\nAll of the infidelity when I was 17 been catchin' up\nIt still feel like she'll catch me cheatin'\nNiggas askin' me how tour was\nKnowin' I been home like two months\nAnd I seen your ass like two times\nSave the small-talk like two dimes\nNo time, social interaction\nHad female friends I found attractive\nI tried to fuck but I am no savage\nNow we don't speak, we just walk past\nIf my past could talk\nIt'd probably reply to the missed calls after all\nCause the friendships that I can't recall\nDone turned my heart into camouflage\nWhile the guys I used to play basketball with\nDoin' shit that I can't endorse now\nWith the Lord now, when it pours down\nWas alone then, still alone now\n\n[Chorus: Saba and Daoud]\nI'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away\nI seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe\nI'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away\nI seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe\nOhhh, ohhh\n\n[Outro: theMIND]\nOooh, ooh, ooh\nOooh, ooh, ooh\nYeahh, yeahh, yeah, yeah\nOhh, ohhh\nOooh, ooh, ooh\nOooh, ooh, ooh\nYeahh, yeahh, yeah, yeah\nOhh, ohhh", "album": null}], "artist": "Saba"}
