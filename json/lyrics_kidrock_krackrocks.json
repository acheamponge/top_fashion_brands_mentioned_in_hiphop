I step in stride\nI pimp across stage with my nuts in my hand\nThe punks wanna front cause I got my own band\nGoddamn I'm the man with the helly buzz\nAnd my shit don't stink, like Kelly's does\nBut Kelly's your girl, man, from what I heard\nNah man, I kicked that bitch to the curb\nI don't really need to be tied down\nI'm a rambling man, and I'm platinum bound\nMe too, hold my brew, I thought you knew\n.16 is what I blew\nI bet that set you straight, that illegal act\nFuck that, I still roll with a 40 in my lap\nBack in 2nd grade, I carried a lunch box\nTurned 21 started smoking crack rocks\nSnorting that D by the dime\nWish I could slow down, I'm ahead of my time\nI'm the Krack, I'm the Krack\nKrack, Krack, Krack\nI'm the Krack bitch, my last dime's what I'm betting\nI'm up in the casino with the fresh flat Stetson\nGirls all stare, they gawk, they sneer\nSo I grab me a bitch and I step the the rear\nMy living room is the place I'm hanging out\nYoung, tight pussies is the shit I'm banging out\nI'm sick of living in these perplexed times\nThat's why I kick these motherfucking sex rhymes\nI'm heading down south[X2]\nI'm heading down, heading down\nHip hip hip hip digging exactly where you go\nI'm heading down south on a dusty path\nI got a cool ass buzz and an empty flask\nAss on the wagon and they think I'm all soft\nBut I don't give a fuck, I'm tripping my balls off\nUp in the crack house, coolin' at Rock's house\nHo's come around an we be knocking the box out\nKnocked out, knocked up and all that shit\nHot wax, sweaty spot, licking spit from your clit\nEverything that gets old It gets over rated\nOld to me, just means out-dated\nI'm the Kid Rock, fuck all that 60's shit\nTake Woodstock and shove it up your momma's slit\nOh shit, and there it is\nI get a lot of pussy cause I'm in show biz\nTwas the night before Christmas and all through the house\nI wished for a kiss and your mom popped out\nPut her hands on her flop and started eyeing me\nSo I smacked the ole bitch with my Flying V\nThat's when I said \"man I gotta get a grip\" and\nLooked at the TV realized I was tripping\n\n[Outro]\nIt is no party like a Detroit party\nCause a Detroit party don't stop\nI said It is no party like a Detroit party\nCause a Detroit party don't stop\nIt is no party like a Detroit party\nCause a Detroit party don't stop\nI said It is no party like a Detroit party\nCause a Detroit party don't stop"}]}
