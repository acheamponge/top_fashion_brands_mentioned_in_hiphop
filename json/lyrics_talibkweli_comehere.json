You need to feel this\nI've got somethin' to tell you, come here real quick\nI've done dirt in the past, I know that love hurts\nI'll come for you, but my lady's got to come first\nI can tell by your hesitation there's trust issues\nYou get excited, ignite it, highly combustible\nYou on a higher vibration, that's why I fuck with you\nLeft me provide for you, comfortable as a Huxtable\nYour whole style is colder than Minnesota\nI love your profile, the way you look over shoulders\nAt the crib, I'm hopin' you come over\nWe can do it like Common and Mary and come closer\nWe can do it like Barack and Michelle, give me a fist bump\nBlack magical, act radical with the fist up\nDo it 'til we rockin' the bells, you like hip-hop\nPromise you I'm not gonna tell, we keep our lips locked\n\n[Hook]\nI don't wanna waste your time baby\nI just wanna make you come to me\nComfortable baby, so come here darling\nAnd come for me baby\nI don't wanna waste a second, no girl\nI just wanna make you come dance with me\nCome talk to me, come here darling\nCome here for me baby\n\n[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]\nLike a Spike Lee movie, I'm movin' across the floor\nFeelin' love in the music, I'm using it like a lure\nI love how you do, with your beauty and your allure\nMake you come like the ocean, approaching me like \"sure\"\nShe Rockefeller Center like Diego in the lobby\nAs valuable as The Scream or a Salvador Dali\nShe popular with the thieves and wanna be Thomas Crown\nSome try to steal her attention as soon as I'm not around\nThis last bird probably flew the coop\nBlastin' Outkast, last words: \"Ooh-Dee-Whoo\"\nI don't know how to describe you, you're so beautiful\nJe ne sais quoi... how you say, \"voulez vous?\"\nPardon my French, with the tongue kissin' I'll make her come hither\n'Til she dancin' with wolves, see how they run with her\nI'm dumb twisted off rum, liquor\nBut fix my composition and give a proposition to consider\n\n[Hook]\nI don't wanna waste your time baby\nI just wanna make you come to me\nComfortable baby, so come here darling\nAnd come for me baby\nI don't wanna waste a second, no girl\nI just wanna make you come dance with me\nCome talk to me, come here darling\nCome here for me baby\n\n[Bridge: Miguel]\nHey you, hey you, hey you\nYeah, I'm talkin' to you\nHey you, hey you, hey you\nYeah, I'm talkin' to you\nSimmer down for me\nSimmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me\nSimmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me\nSimmer down, simmer down, simmer down for me\n\n[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]\nBlack Madonna, you sow the seeds like a farmer\nWhile I manage, just serving long sentences, no commas\nWrite poetry in your honor, your body is like a sauna\nThe promise, you gettin' closer to the sun, you gettin' hotter\nYou the Earth, that's emphatically \"yes\"\nBut I still call you a bad bitch, under my breath, out of respect\nNaturally blessed, Lady Chatterly fresh with tatted flesh\nI ain't gotta ask her \"why you stare\" - that's a \"yes\"\n\n[Hook]\nI don't wanna waste your time baby\nI just wanna make you come to me\nComfortable baby, so come here darling\nAnd come for me baby\nI don't wanna waste a second, no girl\nI just wanna make you come dance with me\nCome talk to me, come here darling\nCome here for me baby"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
