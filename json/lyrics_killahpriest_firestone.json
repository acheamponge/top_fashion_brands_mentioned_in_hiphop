York? Nope, that's just warped\nWith a psychic mind and deep thought\nFrom a palace or a shrine with street talk, ready to blow heat off\nFrom other worlds, balance on a see saw\nNo one's rougher, hang with Goliath brothers, snatch a table cloth\nFrom the last supper, wrapped around my dome\nJust grab the microphone, and spit the bible through poems, I'm in my zone\n\n[Interlude: Killah Priest]\nYouknowhatimean, you know what's going on\nPriest and the RZA, RZA and the Priest\nYouknowhatimean, Psychic World, let's go\n\n[Verse 3: Killah Priest]\nI'm like King David, wings waving, psalms in my mouth\nArmed in my trials, with gauges\nHoly orbs been doused, I'm royal from the 8th house, great bout\nSeven churches, seven virgins, seven spirits, seven lurking\nSeven stare, seven lamps, seven prayers, seven seals\nSeven ant, seven horns, seven angels, seven trumpets, I crack you like the dawn\nI break day over your head, pray for the dead, golden veil, chosen hell"}]}
