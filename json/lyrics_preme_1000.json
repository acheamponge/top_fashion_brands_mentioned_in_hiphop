When I could keep it 1000\nI'm ready to keep, bet they won't see you, know that I keep it 1000\nYou know I'm a genius, I keep it G, bet she gon' see a 1000\nI'm gunna give her 1000, just keep it 1000\nI'm a keep it 1000, just keep it 1000\n\n[Verse 1]\nI\u2019m with my G\u2019s, we G\u2019d up, just dropped some G's and re'd up\nSoon I bet they'll need us, I just kick back and kick my feet up\nI know them boys wan\u2019 meet us, I can make them boys believe us\nYes lord, praise Jesus. Just copped the drop and pulled the seats up\nAnd I just cut them rocks to freeze up, My youngins pop, don\u2019t freeze up\nI bet them hoes won't leave us, my bitch brought friends thats down to team-up\n'Bout to make a ring for G's up, it's gon' take all night to clean up\nI'm a make it hard to keep up, we just live the life you dream of\n\n[Chorus]\nAll a sudden everybody 100, but not too many 1000\nI run through the 100, and keep all the rubber, you can bet they 1000s\nI got my first 100, then said I need me a 1000\nWhy keep it a 100? When I could keep it 1000\nI'm ready to keep, bet they won't see you, know that I keep it 1000\nYou know I'm a genius, I keep it G, bet she gon' see a 1000\nI'm gunna give her 1000, just keep it 1000\nI'm a keep it 1000, just keep it 1000\n\n[Verse 2]\nI ain't never been phony, I put that on my dead homies\nRoom full of dead presidents just so I don't ever get lonely\nBetter back, back you don't know me. If your ass fat you better show me\nIt's like the last game and I'm Kobe, bout to drop 60 large you can't hold me\nAnd these hoes like holy moly, just dropped a fat stack on this Roley\nMy lifes a movie watch closely, bitch it's Scarface and I'm Tony\nWe sip the pink and move slowly, what you did last night was unholy\nAnd I keep bad bitches on me, I don't save these hoes I'm no goalie\n\n[Chorus]\nAll a sudden everybody 100, but not too many 1000\nI run through the 100, and keep all the rubber, you can bet they 1000s\nI got my first 100, then said I need me a 1000\nWhy keep it a 100? When I could keep it 1000\nI'm ready to keep, bet they won't see you, know that I keep it 1000\nYou know I'm a genius, I keep it G, bet she gon' see a 1000\nI'm gunna give her 1000, just keep it 1000\nI'm a keep it 1000, just keep it 1000", "year": "2016-04-27"}]}
