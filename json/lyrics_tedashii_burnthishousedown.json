But I'm not even from Africa\nHard knock life with these after school fights\nMan I just wanna live, this doesn't seem right\nMan it seems so wrong pain lasts this long\nBut this pain was the push to make me want a new home\nI didn't see it but it saw me\nDidn't seek it but it sought me\nDidn't buy it but it bought me\nHope you catch it, it caught me\nEven victims aren't innocent\nAnd need answers for sinfulness\nI understand the simpleness\nBut most still missin' it\n\nThere's a burnin in my soul and there's nowhere to go\nSo with fire in my eyes, I light up the sky\nLet it burn (let it burn)\nI burn this whole house down, let it burn (let it burn)\nI burn this house to the ground\nCause there's too many memories, too much pain\nToo much for me to bear I'm goin' insane\nLet it burn(burn)\nI burn this house to the ground, let it burn(burn)\nI burn this house to the ground\n\nLet it burn, let it burn\nI'm not gon' miss it when it's gone\nLet it burn\nAnd if you thinkin' that I'm sayin'\nThat you gotta be playin'\nI can't wait to leave, let it burn\nLet it burn, let it burn\nI'm not gon' miss it when it's gone\nLet it burn\nAnd if you thinkin' that I'm sayin'\nThat you gotta be playin'\nI can't wait to leave, let it burn"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
