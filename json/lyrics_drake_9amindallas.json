Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club\nDamn, that nigga always kept it so hood\nBack when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods\nAnd have girls fall through like coins in the couch\nNow we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about\nScared for the first time, everything just clicked\nWhat if I don't really do the numbers they predict?\nConsidering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked\nTo write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick\nBut if I really do it don't expect to get a split\nCause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get\nI'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in\nThrowing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen\nBut still throwing touchdown passes\nIn tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it\nPeople say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it\nBut they need to be a little more specific\nIs this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression\nDucking your questions, fuck your suggestions\nMoney gets all of my love and affection\nCars all black like the cover of Essence\nI'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze\nY.M.O.E. nigga, yeah\n\n[Outro]\nUh, yeah, this what yall want\nOctobers Very Own\nYoung Money\nATF\nThank me later in this bitch wasssup\nFree Weezy in this bitch wasup\nJune 15th in this bitch wasup\nNoel That\u2019s it Ahhhhhh"}]}
