{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Aesop Rock]\nYo, I surf an axiom kicked in a center fold by ugly tenements\nOh distribute sour inhalants regulate lobby developments\nToday summon the rug rat oblivious to what's delicate\nTomorrow siphon imperfection out the fetus prior to selling it\nThere is a brain in the thicket tap circle\nCupping the port to accord it\nTeeter thorn storm plunges more\nBut conformers the pouring's half the entry\nPlated pearly gates a chanted axis\nWith high gentry hinging our binging on public picket fencing Squirming in terms in conditions of un-satisfact destiny magnet\nWhere the Ebenezer to Cratchit ratio tragic\nLose sight pseudo mavericks clash at futility pageants\nI post froze in a blaze at a grand combustion\nA leader's deception connection\nWiper with a barn responds his friend\nWith an eye socket full of needles\nAnd a will to die for nothing\nAnd that's glory\nAbide thy crass itinerary barely suitable for common slum cats\nAnd the lemmings will follow you to the blood bath\nAll aboard that awful train through shames patch\nWhere I'd trade my window seat\nFor one pane of replacement stain glass\nSee I bow to the the gods of opacity\nI don't mind y'all looking in\nIt's just watching Sin City steam slips under my skin\nAnd I'm about half way to nausea\nHalf way to contentment\n2 halves post made a dance evoked a whole lot of resentment\nBuild a pen around Mastodon\nPatriarch close to four peters\nWoke to rope cubicles combines with combines suitably ingenious\nLet's soak my feet in lake infinity\nWith a timebomb strapped to dignity\nSymmetries vivid image still can't mimic the victory\nComfort is a drug and I'm numb as fuck\nYet some prefer the hum and\nOthers tend to suck the life out of the crux like\n[One, two, three, four]\nAnd I'm a tug dummy, hug the hungry\nPull the lever, push the button\nDrink the garbage split the homage reap the harvest\nTarget everyone\nMechanized idols inhabit malleable colonies\n'Till the fire ant dropped the sweet leaf, grief\nYour dreams a needle in a needle stack\nClaiming safety pin physics\nBaby tin blizzards collide\nWhile ole iron sides, trust the rivets\nI\u2019m sick of the pick of the litter soaking the spot lit\nWhen I know they know they owe all thanks\nTo the end all Aesop Rock shit, watch this\nOh, build me a home\nBuild me a home of brick and wood and everything good\nWith a front porch where I can jar fire flies by night\nAnd smoke stog's till the day meets twilight\nBuild me a home\nBuild me a home with a green grass hill with running water\nIn a backyard with a sandbox and a garden of foreign flowers\nBuild me a home\nWith a basement and an attic\nWhere I can store remnants of the day I once slept in\nBuild me a home\nNo skull is sacred in the races\nLocked in a pagan doctrine\nWatching born again faces gamble up patience fail blatant\nOchre and sienna war paintings stain plague community\nHarking as wrapped, it's overlooking out crops\nGive you one life to laugh at catalog bliss\nOn the least common attachment\nTen seconds of blaring silence\nPilot is flight redefine stagnant\nMost emotions host an entire lesson\nCongressional, less one\nStone merely for the exceptional spectacle now\nListen the pause heed tall falls the voidance of the suit dispersed\nWhere the straight and narrow\u2019s a perfect circle has-beens\nFastened to the flip side via migrating clusters\nThat's better than colony\nMy own father's son is the holy ghost, suck that theology\nHigh king for a day or peasant for a pleasant life\nBlood on the easel and my eagle eyelid spots runaway pirates\nLook, I despise squatters with a, oh, cry me a river\nA quarter how'd you afford that dog and sour dialogue\nI put my hook in the pond\nI put my worm in the hook\nI put my trust in the worm\nThat he'd bring me something to cook\nI felt a tug on my line and I lugged a trash can\nOn my pole with a note from the worm attached that\nRead, \"Thanks for nothing asshole!\"\nSimple parables of nature making character giddy\nAnd riddle me a similar situation mid city\nQuick, put your honor on the line\nDoors to the monks blood thirsty barracuda serpents and\nReport on powers of devil treatment church links\nI'm a fence sitter\nLips torn by both polars and their working\nI can only model throttle at the dream catching\nMatching a patchy holist with a sovereignty\nHarbored and charged by hate breed anonymity spigot\nSpitting stitches to fix the bridges and the gaps\nOne night I broke in\nBridges give us traps and\nTried to walk to get stogs just like hop scotch between polar caps\nAnd I'm, blue in the face when every second is a waste of breath\nMaking that classic mockery of every step\nOh, build me a home\nBuild me a home, please, with a light in the window\nAnd a red front door and a picket fence\nAnd a fire place and a sturdy frame\nAnd we can sit and I'll tell you my name, build me home...",
