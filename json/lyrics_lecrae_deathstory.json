Okay right\nYou've stolen before right?\nWell man you've already broken two of the ten commandments, man\nThat qualifies you as, a lawbreaker\nThat's, that's sin, man\nThat offends the holy and perfect and righteous God, man\nThat's sin, you need a savior because of the sin, man\nI'm just tryna break it down for you\n\n[Verse 2: Lecrae]\n{gasps} Havin' a hard time breathin'\nBut I ain't leavin' until I know what I believe in\nWait, maybe it was Ak on the block\nWho was tellin' me Mohammed was the rock\nNah, stop!\n(You know man, you know Mohammed was the truth. You know what I'm sayin'? Islam is the way to go yo.)\nBut ain't Mohammed die?\nYeah, dawg and they buried him\nThat's scary then cause I don't know if Allah really carries men\nLet's get back to Jesus {cough}\nCoughin' and wheezin'\nThis worlds full of lies man\nEverything's misleadin'\nThey told me don't be scared to die\nBut dawg that's ridiculous\nCause I don't know what happens to me next in this predicament\nIt's sickenin'\nGod, give me answers\nGive me clues\nHelp me understand\nWho do I trust?\nWhat do I do?\n\n[Spoken: Doctor]\nOkay we're losin' him, we're losin' him!\nHe's dying fast\nNurse! Help me!\nI need help over here\nHurry up!\n\n[Verse 3: Lecrae]\nAh, oh man\nI can't breath\nI'm dyin'\nCan't think\nWait, wait, Mohammed? Buddah?\nNo, no, no, no, no, no\nJesus, Jesus\nOkay, back to Christ\nFirst He lived, then He died\nThen that Easter play I saw one time said He came back alive\nAnd God so loved the world...\nWhat's the rest of that verse?\nThink fast, can't remember\nHelp me nurse!\n\"What's John 3:16, nurse?\n\"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son..\"\nGave up His only son\nOkay yeah that's right\nSo whoever believes in Him\nWait? Who turned out the lights?\nI'm dyin'! I'm dead!\nNo my eyes went closed\nI can't feel my feet no mo'\nAnd my sides is cold\nGod, please I'm sorry for all the wrong that I've done\nI know I've, been a terrible father and a horrible son\nI see it now, I wish that I could change some things\nIn my life, I really never took the blame for things\nLike lyin' and stealin'\nAnd hurtin' and dealin'\nI'll quit it all if you're willin'\nAnd let me walk out this buildin'\nI wronged You, I see that\nI wanna give in\nBut I ain't really sure if you've forgivin' my sins\nWell this is it\nNo more discussion to do\nI don't know much\nBut I know I should be trustin' in..."}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
