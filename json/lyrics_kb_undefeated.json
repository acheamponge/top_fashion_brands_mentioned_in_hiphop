Well I tell you I ain't gon' take it\nI got hands on the nations, check my reputation\nYeah that scoreboard still 1-0 cause my tomb is vacant\nThat's why I'm... Undefeated\nTurned up\nUndefeated\nTurn up\n\n[Verse 1: Derek Minor]\nWho do you think that you are?\nWhen I tell y'all that I run things\nY'all better believe me\nSpin the earth on my finger like round ball\nI'm a globetrotter, its easy\nNo lie boy y'all got me messed up\nNot Buddha, Muhammad and I dang sure ain\u2019t no Yeezus (at all)\nY'all all like I ain't made where you standing\nY'all act like I ain't drown the whole planet\nAct like my son ain't died on that cross\nOr I ain't gave you my all look here I ain't taking no loss\nI love you with all of my heart that's the reason I'm here with my hands open giving my grace\nI know that you know that I'm here ignore me if you want but the next time you spit in my face\nYou better just\n\n[Hook: KB]\nLook up in the sky, ohh I made it\nThink I'm gonna lie when I tell you I ain't gon take it\nI got hands on the nations, check my reputation\nYeah that scoreboard still 1-0 cause my tomb is vacant\nThat's why I'm...
