That\u2019s just how I feel inside\nThat\u2019s just how I feel inside\n(Laid back nigga) That\u2019s just how i sit inside\n(Heard the leather soft) She just wanna feel inside\nThat\u2019s just how I feel inside (feel inside)\nThat\u2019s just how I feel inside\n(Both windows up) That\u2019s just how I sit inside\n(Heard the leather soft) She just wanna feel inside"}]}
