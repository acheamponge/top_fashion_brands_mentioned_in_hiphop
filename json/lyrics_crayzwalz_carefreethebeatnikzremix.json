Jeanine - \u201cCarefree (The Beatnikz Remix)\u201d\n[Emcee(s): C-Rayz Walz]\n[Producer(s): The Beatnikz (Frank Blank and Lil Jay)]\n[Additional Vocals: Khiladi]\n[Hook/Vocals: Jeanine]\n\n[Intro: C-Rayz Walz]\nConfucius say, \u201cMan who likes Sun Cycle always get moon-burnt.\u201d  Hehehe.  Yo, speaking of burnt...\n\n[Hook 1 (Overlapped with Hook 2): C-Rayz Walz]\nThe fashion of the passion was realer than real\nLife was lovely, except what I can\u2019t feel.  Miss you\nHope all is well with you.  Need to talk to you, hold your\nHand and walk with you.  Of course it\u2019s you.  Holler\nBack however.  Hope all is well.  For Heaven\u2019s\nSake, I just went through Hell.

I know you afraid\nBut front Harder than Mike's Lemonade, they say, \u201cWhen a\nMan hold his feelings, that\u2019s how you get titties to form,\u201d but out of\nRaw talent, my son was born.  Sour\n\u201cGrapes of Wrath\u201d never laugh, get old and sad, start to\nWhine/wine when they get pressed for time, define smash\nWithout an essence, esoteric example of ass.  You\u2019ll be\nStuck in the past.  You get it?  (Yeah, that\u2019s some shit, yo).  Unfinished\nRoutes of the in and outs left a bitter taste in your doubt\nGuinness stout mouth or timid house is where the lion sleeps\nSex sells.  Free nights and weekends is my next tale/Nextel\nIf lines beep, then wait to exhale.  A better\nChance to fail if you lie and cheat.  Heads or tails, your conscious\nGets to walking.  Both options\u2019ll drop you off in a coffin\nCoughing in the winter with pneumonia and the flu.  I got\nThe Chaka Khan chronic\u2014god, \"I Feel for You\" (I feel for you)\n\n[Hook 1 (Overlapped with Hook 2): C-Rayz Walz]\nThe fashion of the passion was realer than real\nLife was lovely, except what I can\u2019t feel.

Twenty bucks?  That\nA piff sack attack for both of us, plus we in love\nOn some gay shit\u2014not literally.  Yeah\nMa, if you that shit, then I\u2019m that kid physically.  It\n\u201cRains  Forever\u201d when it pours (Hey).  The problems is formed\n(You ain\u2019t peeped it?) They even plaque with plastic in porn.  Bad\nThings come and go.  Good things come to those who wait.  Life\u2019s\nA test, depending on the one that you take.  Use your\nBrakes, stop, go.  The return I came before.  Y\u2019all ain\u2019t\nSwallowed.  This is the Second Coming\u2014digest hollow points\nFollow the power of suggestion, turn into\nAn answer.  Hope is not confession.  Waiting to ex-\n-hale, don\u2019t hold your breath.  Something like\nHaving your first baby\u2014you\u2019re that close to death\n\n[Hook 1 (Overlapped with Hook 2): C-Rayz Walz]\nThe fashion of the passion was realer than real\nLife was lovely, except what I can\u2019t feel.

(I ain\u2019t want to go see the doc).  I was\nMel Gibsoned out, scared of Conspiracy shots like\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d  (\u201cNah, I\u2019m lying\u201d)\n\u201cI did.  Four times this morning.\u201d  (\u201cWhat about)\n(That night I was drinking?\u201d)  \u201cBut...\u201d  (\u201cWhat about the back of my)\n(Dad\u2019s Lincoln?\u201d)  \u201cWord up, yo.  Shorty was stinking.\u201d  \u201cWait!\nRemember Rhode Island with Rhonda, Robin, and\nAbsinthe?\u201d  (\u201cNah, hold up.  That seems absent.\u201d)  And it\u2019s been, like\nTwenty-five O\u2019s after thirty-five shows.  You know\nHow it goes: rock star on the road with no clothes\nPoking holes.  Tour bus became the Poconos\nIf you don\u2019t smell me, you got a broken nose.  Thinking who you\nBoned, you could feel it in your bones.  Chasing your\nPast on the phone, paranoid, in the zone.  You could be\nFull-blown like hurricanes hit your homes.  There\u2019s\nHella pain in your dome, made you feel strange and alone\nGenital anarchy, penile percolating\nA vaginal voyage with a dismal destination\nYou cry when you born.  We cry when you gone.  It\u2019s hard\nTo see the cypher in the eye of the storm.  What if\nThere was flashcards that gave the rules of life?  To use\nA light in darkness and improve your sight?  It\u2019s all\nFun and games \u2018til it\u2019s not\u2014go \u2018head and \u2018fess.  I know you were\nStressed the first time you took your AIDS test"}]}
