{"songs": [{"title": "The Thieves Banquet Part II", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Akala]\nTowards the end of the feast the devil decided\nHe was so inspired, he couldn't be bothered with giving no prizes\nIn fact he said he would just retire\nCos he could see that what was required\nTo keep our children living in fire\nCould be supplied by these thieves and these liars\nWho had respectable titles\nSo he pronounced that he would bounce\nGo back to hell as his house\nCo-sign his work to these thieves like it was just an ounce\nWe know not what what was said\nBut still live with the effects\nOf what was agreed by the greed\nThat night on the Banquet of thieves\nThe gist is this: The devil bestowed\nAll of the powers for ruling the globe\nOnly to those who would sell their soul\nAnd take the devilish oath\n\n[Hook: Thieves]\nI solemnly swear to steal and kill\nNot because I'm hungry for meals\nBut because my hundreds and millions\nI wanna see turned into billions\nI solemnly swear to make a place\nWhere women and children are raped every day\nWhere some eat ourselves to death\nAnd others can't get a crumb on the plate\n\nI solemnly swear to turn the globe\nInto a living hell for most\nAnd drug with death, anything left\nThat grows or has a pulse\n\n[Verse 2: Akala]\nThe monarchs and dictators, religious leaders and the bankers\nHad one more course before they could complete the Banquet\nScreaming and panting, baby children were brought on plates\nThe end of their tantrums came\nWhen they were stabbed in the heart with a stake\nAnd chopped into pieces, served raw with the blood still warm\nAll the thieves gobbled down the children without a second thought\nThe devil explained; if ever they got to a place where they suffered pain\nOr the slightest of shame, for killing a child\nThey should leave the game\nCos the noblest aim is to turn a child\u2019s flesh to flames\nFor the hollow concept called profit so known as personal gain\nThe devil explained, there is a god, death is his name\nSo treat this life as if it was nothing more than a monopoly game\nSo get to work\nThere\u2019s people to starve and people to slaughter\nAnd also to torture, any rebellious son or daughter\nIf ever you fail, or find yourself getting too frail\nAn angry devil will be forced to return from the comfort of hell\n\n(rand of applause)\n\nAll the thieves got up from their seats and gave the devil applause\nBaby\u2019s blood dripping from their jaws, totally reddend the floor\nWith that the devil vanished\nAnd left the thieves in the palace\nThe banker was the first to speak on how they could meet the challenge\n\n[Banker]\nLook my fellow thieves\nAs long as we unite on the scheme\nWe\u2019ll be living with dreams\nThere\u2019s never been a team this mean\n\n[Religious leader]\nYes Spiritual death\nIs what I provide at the devil's behest\n\n[Monarchs of Empire]\nMonarchs can make laws and the courts\nThat would serve and protect\nOur interests and nothing else\nCommoners can fuck themselves\nCos we all see, democracy will just fuck up our wealth\n\n[Third world dictator]\nThat\u2019s where I can add some value\nTo this  gathering of men\nI can kill in broad daylight\nI don\u2019t have to pretend\nI can do the things that all you rich developed countries can't be seen to do in public\nBut we all know you love it\n\n[Banker]\nYes!\nAnd we can pretend we\u2019re enemies, still at war with each other\nThough we couldn\u2019t be further from the truth we are practically lovers\n\n[Religious leader]\nYou\u2019re quite right Mr. Banker deception must be used\nWe\u2019ll hire prostitutes to spread our views\nAnd call it news\nAnother set of prostitutes that call themselves artists\nTo say what we tell them to\nSpineless Bastards\n\n[Monarchs of empire]\nReligious leader\nThou art a wonderful thief\nThe last thing that we do need before our schemes complete\nIs a set of puppet politicians\nThat talk a lot\nThat the people think hold the power but they\u2019re really our dogs\n\n[Banker]\nYes yes yes, yes oh fucking yes!\nLet us drink to murder and theft\nUntil there\u2019s nothing left\n\n[Narrator]\nThe thieves took a toast of warm blood\nAnd nearly drowned in laughter\nThe Bankers passed  out a charter\nThat they had carefully drafted\nFor the international organization\nOf theft and murder\n\n[Monarch of Empire]\nIf we could sign this in blood\nIt would be totally perfect!\n\n[Akala]\nThat\u2019s what they did\nThey used the child\u2019s bleeding finger\nTo sign a commitment\nTo keep the human spirit a prisoner\nThat\u2019s how it\u2019s been since then\nA cannibalistic system\nRun by thieves dressed in death\nBlessed with the devil's wisdom", "year": null, "album": " The Thieves Banquet", "image": "https://images.genius.com/acaf5708a18660f33365d7d63e4937b7.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
