Looky here, looky here, looky here!\nYou out the frame with it. You off the chain with it\nYou out the frame with it. Woman, woman...\"\n\nYou got your girlfriend around ya\nNo wonder she surround you. Look at you\nYour brown eyes pierce just like a knight\nMake afella think real hard about the rest of his life\nThe whole *shit* is strange. I'm really thinkin' brains\nBut on the other hand, I really feel your stress and pain\nFlimsy little men, they can't command you\nAnd they don't have the heart to demand you\nBut niether do I. I guess I'll let you walk\nOn and watch cause your walk is strong\nSippin' passion wit' a stranger in the club\nIt doesn't necessarily equate to love\nIt's not really in the air, I wanna take it elsewhere\nSomethin' wild that 'chu can't compare\nBangin' on my wood drum now\nHope your hearin' all the sound. Now, *nigga*, come now\nSittin' at home, a hat in my hand\nWhile you crawlin' on the earth with your natural tan\nYour than is jigg-i-lin' and causin' a stir\nLet's do it real rough until life is a blur\n\nI suit you the way that 'chu want\nHey, hey, hey, the way that 'chu want\nIt caught me the way that 'chu want. (\"Uh, uh, uh.\")\nHey, hey, hey, the way that 'chu want. (\"Check it out, now.\")\nI suit you the way that 'chu want. (\"Check it out. Check it. Uh.\")\nHey, hey, hey, the way that 'chu want. (\"Check it.\")\nIt got me the way that 'chu want\nHey, hey, hey, the way that 'chu want\n\nI can kinda understand, you know\nI mean bein' at the top, I mean to start a show\nThe brushes with fame, continuous game you get\nHustles with plans, stakin' they clans and *shit*\nBut you shine and you pay it no mind, always\nStayin' on the grind with the thangs you do\nYou got the illest little switch and you\nAin't takin' no *shit* cause nobody wanna *fuck* wit' 'chu\nAdmiration to the utmost\nAll my dogs raise your cups 'til the girl toast\nI don't wanna bring shame to you really\nI wanna put flames to you sincerly\nMake your box-spring jump like a low rida\nBest place that I could be is inside ya\nThe love that we have could be real\nBut you gotta go by what your heart feels\nHeart feels. Heart feels\nHeart feels. Heart feels\nUh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh\nUh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, come on\n\nI suit you the way that 'chu want\nHey, hey, hey, the way that 'chu want\nIt got me the way that 'chu want. (\"Uh, uh, uh.\")\nHey, hey, hey, the way that 'chu want. (\"Check it out, now.\")\nI suit you the way that 'chu want. (\"Check it out. Check it. Uh.\")\nHey, hey, hey, the way that 'chu want. (\"Check it.\")\nIt caught me the way that 'chu want\nHey, hey, hey, the way that 'chu want"}], "artist": "Q-Tip"}
