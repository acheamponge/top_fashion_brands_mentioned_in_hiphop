Stalin]\nLil nigga, I done came up\nYeah, nigga, I done came up\nYeah, nigga, I done came up\nYeah, nigga, I done came up\nLil nigga, I done came up (Cypress Village)\nGot my mothafuckin' change up (West Oakland)\nGot my mothafuckin' fame up (Livewire)\nBut I will never change up (Livewire)\nLil nigga, I done came up (Blap)\nLil nigga, I done came up (10th Street)\nLil nigga, I done came up (Richmond)\n\n[Verse 1: J. Stalin]\nRidin' with a stick, whole 30 in it\nIn the scraper with my windows tinted\nI'm the realest nigga ever invented\nThe real Popeye The Sailor Man, all about my spinach\nCypress Village niggas, still a cold blooded killa\nI drop it on Halloween, nigga, call that shit Thriller\nI came from drug dealin', where niggas rattin' and squealin'\nThe rest of them lovin' bitches and talkin' on top of pills\nI was sellin' coke and splittin' them cigarillos\nSmokin' on the best 'cause the lye stay official\nTote pistols, I don't know about no issues\nJust Fishscale and Dogg Food\n\n[Hook: J. Stalin]\nLil nigga, I done came up (Cypress Village)\nGot my mothafuckin' change up (West Oakland)\nGot my mothafuckin' fame up (Livewire)\nBut I will never change up (Livewire)\nLil nigga, I done came up (Blap)\nLil nigga, I done came up (10th Street)\nLil nigga, I done came up (Richmond)\n\n[Verse 2: J. Stalin]\nMade bands off hard white\nAnd I only come out at night\nIf I'm funkin' with them niggas and I see 'em it's on sight\nSyrup up in my Sprite\nYou mad 'cause my money right\nGot all these foreign whips, that's a coke dealers delight\nBlap in my pocket, that's a compact .40\nNiggas goin' arond trippin', I kick it off like Shinobi\nI don't got a lot of homies, it's too many broke haters\nGot a choppa by my bed, so I sleep with Al-Qaeda\nLay a nigga up, give 'em fade or a taper\nI'll have your ass murdered for a lil bit of paper\nLay your ass up, give 'em fade or a taper\nI'll have your ass murdered for a lil bit of paper\n\n[Hook: J. Stalin]\nLil nigga, I done came up (Cypress Village)\nGot my mothafuckin' change up (West Oakland)\nGot my mothafuckin' fame up (Livewire)\nBut I will never change up (Livewire)\nLil nigga, I done came up (Blap)\nLil nigga, I done came up (10th Street)\nLil nigga, I done came up (Richmond)"}], "artist": "J.
