Blige]\nWanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?\nPlease, please don't play this song\nR-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right\nTrying to get my mind, my mind, my mind, right, right\nPeople think they really being helpful\nBy telling me please be careful, yeah right\nR-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right\nPlease, please don't play this song\n\n[Verse 1]\nPain, hurt, sadness and loneliness\nBalled all that shit right up\nTossed it away to the bottomless pit\nThe part of my mind that slips\nAnd the part of my mind so sick\nI don't even like to take the trip unless I'm sloppy drunk\nI pray for my mom, how to teach had a son\nThat never gave a fuck about a scantron?\nAll I wanted was to be a human being\nAnd show all the world some new colors and scenes\nImagine all types of beautiful scenery\nI remember when I first had trees\nSmoked out a Black and Mild, so dumb of me\nNow, I'm grape Cigarillo man\nAny young black kid, guaranteed fan\nHold it down, humble pie on the humble\nAnd I treat normal girls like models\nReckless and young and my, my mom's calling\nThink I should hit decline\nI'm numb faced while I'm thinking 'bout suicide\n\n[Chorus: Kid Cudi, Mary J. Blige, Kid Cudi & Mary J. Blige]\nWanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?\nPlease, please don't play this song (Please don't play this song)\nR-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right (Right)\nTrying to get my mind, my mind, my mind, right, right\nPeople think they really being helpful\nBy telling me please be careful, yeah right\nR-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right (Hey, whoa)\nPlease, please don't play this song (Yeah, hey)\n\n[Verse 2]\nBlack Robin Hood, riding high just like we should\nYou know the saying, ain't no delaying\nGotta gets the getting while the getting's good\nYeah, demented, my brain was forced to transform\nWise up, I'm checking the gate\nOn humble tales and minimum wage\nThe blogs tell it; \"Cudi's lame\nWearing a kilt? He must be gay.\"\nLet's keep it trill, fuck being discreet\nBet some girls tweet how they miss my meat\nYeah, Cudders, HBO, that Vitamin Water\nThat's money to blow 'cause it's money for blow\nDon't take no shit, you can blame my ma\nI'm in the maze, I'm in a daze, I'm losing it\nI'm locking in my rocketship\nI'll be a blip on your radar, bitch\nFeels like things can be covered\nUntil the day I'm above myself, hovered\n\n[Chorus: Kid Cudi, Mary J. Blige, Kid Cudi & Mary J. Blige]\nWanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?\nPlease, please don't play this song\nR-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right (\u2014ight)\nTrying to get my mind, my mind, my mind, right, right\nPeople think they really being helpful\nBy telling me please be careful, yeah right (Me)\nR-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right (They thinking 'bout me)\nPlease, please don't play this song, aha\n\n[Outro: Kid Cudi, Mary J.
