House Gang... now we gat y'all\nCheck it...\n\n[Hook: Chico DeBarge]\nYou abandoned me, y'all don't live here anymore...\nJust a vacancy, y'all don't live here anymore...\n\n[Carlton Fisk]\nThe scene open, see my mother at a table, focused\nA belt wrapped around her arm, veins bulging\nA bottle top, a little cotton, intervene this needle dirty bopping\nHands swollen, psalms untoppable\nLittle kid I watch the nod, know the rules\nNever talk to a teacher in school\nYou might think that this environment's cruel\nFuck it, this what I decided to do\nStarted stealing anything I could move\nNow I'm thirteen, with something to prove\nBuddha hit me with a twenty-two\nThat started my career with a tool\nNothing to it, get up on 'em, tell 'em \"pass it all\"\nSince you short, if you move, blast it off\nLike a rocket, if he falls, dig his pockets and run\nAnd if you get caught, just rep where you from, little nigga\nI know what's it like out there, you strugglin' and you grinding, let's go\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Inspectah Deck]\nThug paradise, drugs, gats and knives, life sacrifice\nNickel dime grind, catch a full clip, half price\nKings tumble in time, it's like a jungle sometimes\nI play it humble, gotta rumble sometimes\nBig timers taking numbers with nines, with the bundles of dimes\nYou wind up, with a gun to your spine\nAnd the coppers never solve the case\nThem gorillas in the mist, war, and get lost they hard to trace\nMan this cold world'll scar ya fate, so I stay awake\nLate night with cigars, and jars of haze\nHalf my comrades dead or in jail, most said I would fail\nI'm still alive, getting checks in the mail\nStill cowards wanna force my hand, eating off my hand\nBoiling water, never lost a gram\nCash Rules, I'm pulling off the scam, catch the bossman\nSure hand, on the dice, in the game of life, life\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Hook: Chico DeBarge]\nYou don't know... what it cost to pay that ride\nYou don't know... what you lost til it pass you by\nYou don't know baby, that you could, til time is fading you by\nAnd you don't miss, all that's in your way, til you circle or try\n\n[Hook to fade]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b594b451e76ffa06266ec5bb5611cfd9.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "The Resident Patient", "year": null}]}
