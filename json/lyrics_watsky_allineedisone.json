I\u2019ll take everything you give me\nBut don\u2019t pity me, there\u2019s people living on a single kidney\nIn my shitty car I\u2019m living large and mashing through my city\nSitting pretty I know\nThat I\u2019m ready to go\n\n[Chorus]\nOne tape in the deck\nOne way to connect (All I need is one)\nOne moment alone\nOne reason to roam\nOne place I call home (All I need is one)\nOne tick on the clock\nOne trick up my sleeve\nOne thing to believe (All I need is one)\nOne person to love\nOne verse and one prayer\nFor one person who cares (All I need is one)\nSo put one hand in the air\n\n[Verse 2]\nFor beautiful babies in Vegas on their last chip\nFor all my ninth life kittens hittin\u2019 catnip\nFor heavy drinkers thinking they were never jack shit\nYou\u2019re thinking that\u2019s it, but hit a backflip\nYou got a cracked rib or, maybe a bad liver\nYou got a bad hip or even a bad temper\nBut if it\u2019s last supper, one legged mad leper\nPut on that glass slipper, you ain\u2019t no half stepper\nThis ain\u2019t no last breath, it\u2019s only one collapsed lung\nWe\u2019re holding up the bank with nothing but a cap gun\nDown to your last blank\nDown to my last drop\nUp in the gas tank\nWe better have fun\nTime isn\u2019t a sacred cow\nAnd I\u2019m willing to take it down to the final minute or second, milking my last one\nGoing up for a take and I\u2019m itching for action\nAll I need is one\nI should remind myself that\nAll I need is one\n\n[Chorus]\nOne tape in the deck\nOne way to connect (All I need is one)\nOne moment alone\nOne reason to roam\nOne place I call home (All I need is one)\nOne tick on the clock\nOne trick up my sleeve\nOne thing to believe (All I need is one)\nOne person to love\nOne verse and one prayer\nFor one person who cares (All I need is one)\nSo put one hand in the air", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0ed2171f9fa650ff0ccb5bcecb02d6f3.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Cardboard Castles", "title": "All I Need is One"}]}
