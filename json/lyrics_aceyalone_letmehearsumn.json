{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Hook: repeat 2X]\nLemme hear somethin'\nLemme hold somethin'\nRoll somethin'\nLemme show you somethin'\nWhat'chu know good\nWhat's poppin' wit'chu\nWhat's happenin'\nWhat's crackalackin'?\nHow you mackin'?\nYou still bad actin'?\n\n[Verse 1: Aceyalone]\nI'll be in the back rappin'\nClownin' and laughin'\nJumped up\nWhen I heard somebody was cappin'\nI'm usually kickin' it and coolin' and lampin'\nThen I heard wackass rappers was runnin' rampant\nThey always wanna sample it\nTake it for they own\nAnd take it home\nBut they eventually break a bone\nBut I'mma take 'em on\nTo the break a dawn\nI'll take your girl and make her moan\nShit I'm in the zone\nSorry for fuckin' up your little tea party\nMy bad, just wanna show you how we party\nLosers night out, hit the club like a champ\nFind me a spot on the floor and set up my camp\nCuttin' up the amps and dancin' with some ladies\nBeen livin' shady since the late eighties\nA date maybe, in a purple moon\nI was dippin' so hard that I broke the spoon\nI like to float about five feet off the floor\nOffa brown rum, green bud and off tour\nOff the head, offa the pacific shore\nRhymes galore, what more could you ask for?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Casual]\nIt's like the buddha bomb brothers we gutter\nI let 'em shine now I close the shutters\nOn the others so let's begin\nThe way I finesse the pen\nKeep me runnin' through women\nLike estrogen\nLittle mama with the sexy skin\nStill lets me in\nIn the bay jet skiin'\nWith two lesbians\nI leans gangsta\nWhatever you catch me in\nEven a Harley lookin' out for pedestrians\nCats remember the rap\nThe center is action packed\nAdrenaline\nRaw raps will hinder them\nWith more momentum than a pendulum shift\nBear witness to the synthesis I'm hittin' em with\nCasual and Aceyalone\nYou crazy? Imagine your brains being blown\nNigga burn somethin', learn somethin'\nBlow somethin' like you want something'\nIf not, lemme hold somethin'\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Big Arch]\nI'm living large like a fresh white 3-X\nYou give me respect\nAnd if you don't like it get the eject\nI detect a gang of haters in the 380\nYour innovator\nBeat creators\nKeep thinkin you gon' be major\nO say ya got me gone off doja\nThe rap composer\nThe shit I just told ya\nShould hold ya\nWanna dose of ya nigga?\nHold your composure\nI'll be back in another twenty-four\nWhen I get sober\nLo and behold\nA nigga flowin' so cold\nI grab the microphone\nAnd turn it into a sno-cone\nHa! Big nigga gettin my smoke on\nWhen I leave I'll still be bumpin up on the system in your home\nUh! While you willin' to get it on\nI'll be killin' this song\nGot you feelin' it in your bones\nThe chrome steady driven it in your dome\nMakin' sure you niggas get it and then I'm gone\nI'm through your zone like I'm Jerome Bettis n'\nI'mma give these niggas a dose of they own medicine\nHa! You know you gon' get it if\nYou come off in this nigga's home\nShowin' the wrong ettequitte\nC'mon killa\nMind your manners my gorilla\nThere's plenty of scrilla\nAnd bananas for a nigga\nBut you gotta be a go getta\nGet you a good girl\nDon't get you no gold digga\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Let Me Hear Sumn", "album": "Love and Hate", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8aabb2266f1dc21cbed33421bd2b76e2.220x220x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
