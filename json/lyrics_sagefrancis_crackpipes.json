That it would go back to the way things were\nThat it would go back to normal soon\nSaw the moon in a way that I never seen it before\nWhen I looked up that night into the sky wondering why\nLookin' for answers, guess I ain't ask right\nI'm guessin most of yall out there know exactly what that's like\nWhat that's like, now tell me what's that like?\nIt's like a whirlwind of emotions occurs when moms and dads fight\nIt's like when a girl grins, an emotion of hers\nThat holds your arm, and grabs tight\nHurl him into the ocean, one of them cold sweat heat flash types\nWith extreme fluctuations and temperature changes\nHave been known to crack pipes...\n...crack pipes...crack pipes...\n\nMeet me-- half way and I'll go that extra length just to help your strength\nMeet me-- at the AA meeting, needing to take more then 12 steps\nBring me to your hiding place, so I can face your vice grip\nI'll chisel every single monkey off your back with this ice pick\nCome meet up with me on the sidelines when the game is over\nJust to say hello, then afterwards, backstage\nTo let me know that you enjoyed the show\nAnd go to grandma's house for Sunday dinner\nSit at the head of table take away the fatal flaw\nYou made the day before, I seen you bleed\nMeet me-- on Christmas Eve, we can fight but make up before you leave\nMake visits with the rest of those that rest in pieces on my dreams\nMeet me at the fork in the road where the lost souls get indecisive\nMeet me at the crossroads so I can have someone to walk into the light with", "album": "Personal Journals"}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
