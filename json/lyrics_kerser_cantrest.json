Remember it true bruz\nCome along the road, don't forget what I do 'cause\nYou're doing it too, make moves and march on\nTake my life now this could be my last song, I'm gone\n\n[Verse 2:]\nLife just ticks, I might just quit\nIn a life like this, is my life just shit?\nI got a feeling that for me it's kinda on its way\nI had to tell you why I'm here I'm being honest aye\nI picture gun blasts, two cunts, one mask\nMy thin blood marks walls, fuck I must laugh\nThat's a dream that I had on my birthday\nJust luck that I fit it in with word play\nNow if that happens I am right I was a genius\nIf it doesn't I am paranoid I mean this\nThere's my life hate I'm used to it\nLast ten years mate got me moving quick\nAnd I fight with my girl like a movie flick\n'Cause she listening to rumours by a groupie bitch\nI can't take this shit, I'ma break to bits\nI got my taste of fame and it tastes like shit\nEveryone talk shit and they taking shots\nThey don't know who I am but they breaking Scott\nIs there anyone there that could make it stop\nI don't need no hoe trying to take it off\nI just need my road when I'm taking off\nAnd I hit that stage while I'm blazing pot\nThis the life of a rock star stuck in the past\nThat's the 2-2-5 yeah I'm chucking it up\nNeed space today, I need to take my brain\nReconstruct that shit before it's sprayed away today\nYeah, let it roll, yeah\n\n[Verse 3:]\nTell me do you hear this, write a review\nThey say I can't rap deep what you like me to do?\nYou wanna hear about a blade tucked since I hit seventeen\nParanoid, fucked up, like I think they getting me\nYou wanna hear about smoking till your chest claps\nOr sixteen, doing breaks I need to get that\nOr bills piling up on top of the fridge\nMum yelling at the paper, how she gonna pay this\nHow we got a place to live but its slipping quick\nShe has to split, need my own place I'm spinning out shit\nBut I moved out young, turned boy to man\nI got my dad pride now, come and join the clan\nNow I don't give a fuck and I'm ready for war\nI'll take your head from your neck leave your head at your door\nFuck everyone dissing, you don't know what I am\nI'm a motherfucking soldier and I'm going at them\nThat's why I'm selling CDs on the verge of greatness\nOnce this drops I'll be referred to as the greatest\nSo sit back, there's no reason to hate\nAnd if you still hate me now, best believe that you're fake aye\n\n[Outro:]\nNo way will I end it now\nI gotta take these thoughts and send em out\nI am lost so lost but I need a buzz\n'Cause it helps me knowing fans need me cuz\nNo way will I end it now\nI gotta take these thoughts and send em out\nI am lost so lost but I need a buzz\n'Cause it helps me knowing fans need me cuz"}], "artist": "Kerser"}
