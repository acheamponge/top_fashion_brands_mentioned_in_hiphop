Where am I? Don't have a clue\nI'm tripping on stumbling all over you\nSorry just sick a belt, I wasn't tryin' to Copperfield\nSomebody take the wheel, I'm not drunk I'm on the thrill\n\n[Hook]\nWe got our heads in the sky, love got me high\nLet's live tonight, sleep when we die\nRun from the sunlight into the wild side\nLet's live tonight, sleep when we die\nWe got our heads in the sky, love got me high\nLet's live tonight, sleep when we die\n\n[Verse 2]\nFound me with the crew\nThose minutes in the outlaws\nWe used to breaking rules\nAnd runnin' from them cop cars\nYou know them boys in blue, they could be such a kill joy\nYou see us on the news but we just tryin' to chill boy\n\n[Bridge 2]\nWhere am I? Where am I? Don't have a clue\nI'm tripping on stumbling all over you\nSorry but girl you're bad, OK I'm in the touch out\nSomebody take the wheel, I'm not drunk I'm on the thrill\n\n[Hook x3]"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
