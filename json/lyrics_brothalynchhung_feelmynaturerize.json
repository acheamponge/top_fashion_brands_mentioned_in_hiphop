in your back seat, catch you by surprise\nSituations and circumstances make you take them dangerous chances\nLeave you in your front seat with your neck slit, then I'm hittin' fences\nNow I'mma talk about the same dirty situation\nShit you hatin', that's why your casket is waitin'\nShine your ass up like a triple gold Dayton\nWhen I'm in your town you better cut like Walter Payton\nStudio man keep tapin', I got that bitch, she peratratin'\nShow your whole family, leave you on your front porch hangin'\nWith a note that's saying: 'sincerely, Swartzaniggaz'\nPut your hands in your pocket, give it up\nI demand I need my tweed, potent refer, man\nBandstandin' with the hand cannon\nSplit my face, muthafucka, gimme your scrill\nAnd that Rolex in your hand, understand?\nYeah, you gots to feel my nature rise\n\n(C.O.S.):\nI can feel my nature rise\nStarin' at the marks that I despise\nThrough evil eyes, hostile thoughts turn homicides\nYou gots to die, for tryna ride and get me\nGot some off, but none of them hit me\nNow on a payback tip, with a pitch black mask\nOn the grass with a 50 caliber weapon\nHangin' up over the door of the Chev and causin' slaughter\nSid's Malt Liquor be that motive when I be loaded off that water\nSaw the situation heavy rollin'\nShotgun and a Chevy that's stolen\nStrapped up and ready in case these niggas wanna get deadly\nWe can go there, I know there's a place for busta niggas like ya'll\nBut I heard it's pretty deep down so you niggas better watch your fall\nToo late for that 911 call, this murder's already in progress\nHome invasions like Asian got me obsessed like a Vietnam vet\nAs I kick through the front door, blastin'\nAnd Lynch kicked down the back\nOperation: Peel-a-cap, you fools shoulda already had your gats loaded\nCuz it ain't no tellin' when we comin'\nBack streets, sacks of weed get blazed as we gunnin' with the engine still\nRunnin'\nCuz real killers make them real quick get aways\nSpray the whole place and skirt\nAs quick as we can, we does our dirt\nWhoever gets hurt, that's business\nSo please don't take this personal\nIt's just that murder's in my nature\nSo four years now, that's what I've been searchin' for\nCuz doin' dirt grows old when it's the same old thing\nThat's why I try to take my murders to the highest extreme\nMake everybody scream, open up some spleens\nStill hearin' the blood spillin'\nIt's just a little dream that I be havin'\nMan, I love killin'\n\n(Brotha Lynch):\nI got a hard dick for killin'\nSouthside villain\nProtect your wife and your children\nFeel my nature rise\n\n(Sicx):\nNot quite knowin' about this nigga?\nCheck your metro sections\nThen cross reference murders by streets and dates\nAnd how many times niggas' hoes' got raped\nMr. No Prints, the reason one time runs out of yellow tape\nFuckin' with a half deck, havin' niggas on hush\nSmokin' a bowl that I re-dust\nOpen up your chest when I bust\nSo suit up, cuz it's kill a nigga night\nAin't no tellin' when Triple 6 gets to shootin' up\nMovin' up your death date, with a Tre-8 special\nIt's way too late to wrestle, as I nestle the sword stoppers\nSplit your ass open like pinata\nLoadin' up like a Rotweiler\nLining up like Tyson snortin' cocaine powder\nPure dank sniffer, some like a lot of fluid, but I beg to differ\nOne wiff of that shit and I'm on cloud nine\nNigga, don't trip if you ain't got no nuts\nCuz I brought mine all buffed and shined\nUntouchable when I'm fuckin' full of that nitrate wine\nThat's when I bust on nineteen times and up\nCuz I'm nuts, goin' out my mind\nFew, there's no luck, you fucked for life, for sho'\nGet your ass up on the floor\nTryin' to catch me at that lateral, slippin'\nBy my lonesome, but I'm on some, so who wants some?\nFresh out the gates, ain't no room to make mistakes\nTry to make my tapes, but I feel the ho hate\nTuck my dick inside in the O-8\nMust of been the way the clip mate with the .45\nNo body, no case\nTaste the meat, can't wait to eat\nKeep the street dirty, keep sturdy in your face\n\n(TallCann G):\nYa'll niggas don't wanna feel my nature rise\nCuz I get dirty, shoot up shit with my Clint Eastwood\nLeave your neighborhood lookin' like a ghost town, nigga\nYou standin' on dangerous grounds\nWhen we come to Sac, better have your automatics on loaded status\nCuz me and my niggas be on the savage, leavin' no prints\nNot givin' ya'll niggas a inch, cuz I'mma lynch you\nFry your guts like Sizziline\nHave your homie reminiscing' about your gangsta lean\nNigga, it ain't no fuckin' with my clique\nYou can dial 911, but it ain't no rescue\nMan, I hope the dear Lord bless you\nNext to this nigga, ain't no one's nuts bigger\nClutch your guts nigga, fuckin' with this Swartzanigga\nCuz I done lost it, taggin' niggas like a pit bull with rabies\nGone off 40 ounces of O.E\nCreepin' up on you, like doin' my Magnum P.I\nLazy Eye with Lil' Blacc Mile\nSmokin' a hard dick for killin'", "year": "1997-09-16",
