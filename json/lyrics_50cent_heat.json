I don't play that shit, and I'm finna' buss a cap in a nigga\nMan 2 : Man, shut the fuck up! Whoa! Slow down, slow down, slow down! You see that brick house right there? That's the nigga's crib. When he come out you gotta tighten his ass up. Imma get in the other car. Aight\nCar revs up\nGunshots\n\n[Chorus]\nIf there's beef cock it and dump it\nThe drama really means nothing to me\nI'll ride by and blow ya brains out\nThere's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it\nWhen niggas run up on you with them thangs out\nI do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught\nThe DA can play this motherfucking tape in court\nI'll kill you\nI ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing\nCatch you slipping I'ma kill you\nI ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing\n\n[Verse 1]\nKeep thinking I'm candy 'til ya fucking skull get popped\nAnd ya brain hop out the top like Jack-in-the-box\nIn the hood summer time is the killing season\nIt's hot out this bitch that's a good enough reason\nI've seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding\nSaying \"Lord, Jesus help me\" cause they ass leaking\nWhen they window roll down and that A.K. come out\nYou can squeeze ya little handgun til you run out\nAnd you can run for ya backup\nBut them machine gun shells gon tear ya back up\nGod's on ya side? Shit, I'm aight with that\n'Cause we gon' reload them clips and come right back\nIt's a fact, homie, you go against me ya fucked\nI get the drop, if you can duck ya luckier than Lady Luck\nLook, nigga, don't think you safe cause you moved out the hood\n'Cause ya mama still around, dawg, and that ain't good\nIf you was smart you'd be shook of me\n'Cause I get tired of looking for ya\nSpray ya mama crib and let yo ass look for me\n\n[Chorus]\nIf there's beef cock it and dump it\nThe drama really means nothing to me\nI'll ride by and blow ya brains out\nThere's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it\nWhen niggas run up on you with them thangs out\nI do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught\nThe DA can play this motherfucking tape in court\nI'll kill you\nI ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing\nCatch you slipping I'ma kill you\nI ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy heart bleeds for you, nigga, I can't wait to get to you\nBehind that twinkle in ya eyes, I can see the bitch in you\nNigga, you know the streets talk\nSo they'll be no white flags and no peace talks\nI got my back against the wind\nI'm down to ride 'till the sun burn out\nIf I die today I'm happy how my life turned out\nSee the shootouts that I've been in by myself\nLocked up was in a box by myself\nI done made myself a millionaire by myself\nNow shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help\nI done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood\nBut ya shooter finna to get shot, it won't do him no good\nWith a pistol I define the definition of pain\nIf you survive ya bones'll still fucking hurt when it rain\nOh, you a pawn playing battleship? Well, this ain't the same\nLittle homie this is a whole different type of war game\nSee the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains\nOr laid out in the streets leaking out they brains\n\n[Chorus]\nIf there's beef cock it and dump it\nThe drama really means nothing to me\nI'll ride by and blow ya brains out\nThere's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it\nWhen niggas run up on you with them thangs out\nI do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught\nThe DA can play this motherfucking tape in court\nI'll kill you\nI ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing\nCatch you slipping I'ma kill you\nI ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing\n\n[Bridge]\nAfter the fist fights it's gunfire, boy, you get the best of me (best of me)\nIf you don't wanna get shot I suggest you don't go testing me (testing me)\nAll the wrong I've done the Lord still keep on blessing me (blessing me)\nFinna run rap cause Dr. Dre got the recipe (the recipe, recipe)\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, uh ha, aye Dre\nYou got me feeling real bulletproof up in this motherfucker\n'Cause my windows on my motherfucking Benz is bulletproof, nigga\n'Cause my motherfucking vest is bulletproof, nigga\n'Cause my motherfuckin hat is bulletproof, nigga\nBut the Doc said if I get hit I might get a fucking concussion\nBetter that than a hole in the head right, nigga?", "year": "2003-02-06"}]}
