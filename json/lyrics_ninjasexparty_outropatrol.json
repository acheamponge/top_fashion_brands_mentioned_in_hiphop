Kudos!\nWe hope you enjoyed yourself and that it was a musical adventure\nThat touched your heart, your mind, your butt, your soul, your butt again\nAnd of course, your schpoodle!\n\nA lot of bands don't get the chance to make six albums\nSo we just wanted to thank you, the fans, from the bottom of our schpoodles for supporting us!\nWe love you so much and we promise to have sex with and/or kill as many of you as possible\nSorry, Brian and I have competing agendas...\n\nUntil next time, as they say in Italy, au revoir!\nThat means good morning!"}], "artist": "Ninja Sex Party"}
