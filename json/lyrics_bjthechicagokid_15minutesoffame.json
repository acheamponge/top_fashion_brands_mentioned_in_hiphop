Clock\u2019s tickin'\nI fell for someone who couldn\u2019t stop trippin'\nListen up, if yo' heart broke you better glue the pieces\nI put my ex down like there\u2019s treasure underneath 'er\nLove me in the limelight but the spotlight fades\nBack of the jersey all you wanted was a name and\nGuess I was to blame even thinkin' you would change\nLike Spike, like Jack, I watched you play games every day\nWhat\u2019s the point of a partner you can\u2019t depend on?\nDrowning in emotions, that ain\u2019t a surface to swim on\nYou never gon' get it like En Vogue in the friend zone\nSeen it comin' quicker like a psychic who a nympho\nBut I\u2019m cool on my bullshit\nLike a matador with new shoes avoid the bullshit\nSaid I was the one like Neo and I\u2019m guessin' you was right\nWhen you left felt I dodged a bullet\n15 minutes, 15 minutes\n15 minutes, baby girl you\u2019re gone\nKnow I used to love 'er, word to Common, I ain't never hatin'\nI\u2019m turnin' tables like I\u2019m doin some redecoratin'\nFall in love, bring a parachute\nGirl, love is blind, now I wonder what I seen in you\nGirlfriends turnin', you want blowin up and now you like wow\nYour 15 minutes end -- now\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "BJ the Chicago Kid"}
