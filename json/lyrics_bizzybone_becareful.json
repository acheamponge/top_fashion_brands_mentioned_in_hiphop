When I was a baby, pops callin' me bitch, hurtin' my moms\nGimme the reason to stop your breathin'\nAnd I will leave him eatin' lesions\nI ain't even drop the bomb\nIn the nineties I'm at Juvi\nTil I escaped in Cleveland, sinnin' and shootin' Uzis\nYou won't punk me, a stack don't front me\nNo crack, put it up and laugh\nAnd get with the Bone Thugs mash\nIn the winter walkin', real weezy by myself\nAnd dreams of hookin' with Eazy made me queasy\nMaybe no food and bad health\nYou see, my forefathers left me no wealth, put it in my loins\nAnd plus, my groins stay poised\nAnd only count on yourself\nDamn, who would've found thanks, swing I'm slick\nAnd even though I'mma stick all of my shit, you better back off em, bitch\nI remember CrackLand,broads blastin wit deuce deuces & missing,over some dick\nI'm still laughin' on my mission\n\n(Chorus)\nYou gotta be careful where you go\nYou gotta be careful what you do\nYou gotta be careful who you use\nYou gotta be careful who you choose\n\n(Bizzy)\nSee, in the trenches with my henchmen\nRespecting the blessings given on the commison\nWhile my pops is all locked up in prison, I miss him\nWith no child hood tales, I was a daddy at twelve\nHell, I love my children all is well\nOh yeah, sell a key for payments\nSee my baby's need it daily\nLay Lay I see you're shady, huh\nNiggas must be crazy\nI love my lady but no way will she play me for pay, baby\nAnd I'm down for mine, give up my money, money\nNigga, they can't fade me make it clear hustlin' year to year\nWhy don't you lend in need cause niggas is out here strugglin'\nHoldin' back the tears, but it ain't nothin'\nSomethin', somethin', but enough to blow up the functions\nOne of my homies that I buck with, oh\n\n(Chorus: repeat 2X)\nYou gotta be careful where you go\nYou gotta be careful what you do\nYou gotta be careful who you use\nYou gotta be careful who you choose\n\n(Bizzy)\nYou know what I tell her with hella attitude, do what you gotta do\nGo fuck who you wanna fuck\nSmoke with whoever you want to\nWait a minute when it might haunt you\nAnd while every nigga in jail found the Lord\nCause it's time to visit the parole board\nI stay strapped down, hold the gat down, hit the floor\nI'm comin' up outta this motherfucker through the door\nNiggas come when the money's abundant\nBut then start runnin' when it ain't no fun\nAnd when the war gets close, and niggas get gun-sick\nTellin' me to think about my kids\nBig bitch, swear to God, they ain't punk\nYou can turn a ho into a house wife\nOr fake niggas into real niggas\nWhere everyone wanna be in the limelight\nOr they wanna be the niggas to kill on the frontline\nStickin to the message\nCause other motherfuckers have you thinkin like prison\nThey ain't tryin to go to Heaven\nMight as well pull out your weapon and blast yourself\nI had a vision of a little division\nI'm on a mission traveling the world\nTalk to all the little children, the adults is fake\nAnd don't listen, watch your back\nA nigga had a premonition\n\n(Chorus) (repeat 'til fade)\nYou gotta be careful where you go\nYou gotta be careful what you do\nYou gotta be careful who you use\nYou gotta be careful who you choose\n\n(Bizzy - repeat 2X)\nI don't wanna rock the pump\nBut I'mma do it if I have to pop the trunk\nAnd I'mma get 'em niggas thinkin they missed me what\nNigga that thuggish ruggish fucked them up"}], "artist": "Bizzy Bone"}
