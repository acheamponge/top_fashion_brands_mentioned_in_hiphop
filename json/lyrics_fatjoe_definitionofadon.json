Definition of a Don\nIt's like I gotta keep remindin you and remindin you\nWho's that nigga.. You heard the kid\nFlowers on the casket of all those who oppose the squadus\nIt's the motherfuckin Don Cartagena ya heard\nWhat?!\n\n[Hook: Remy Martin]\nThey wanna know why ya name is Joey Crack\nYou a hustler, how they think you got the stacks? (Uh)\nYou stuck being in jacks on the blocks witcha paps (Yeah)\nAnd the Squad to hard niggas gotta fall back (Tell 'em)\nDamn papi, you're shit is icey now (Uh-huh)\nIn the Bronx witcha Benz rims pokin out (Ten mil)\nYou got the niggas in the pen straight loc'in out\nBut when the don is on nigga close ya mouth\n\n[Fat Joe]\nYeah, yo\nYou wouldn't understand my story of life I live\nMost niggas that really know me got life as bids\nThe trife as kids, this ain't no Scarface shit\nThese niggas really will kill you, your wife, and kids\nI walked through many blocks niggas couldn't stand on\nHad shit locked before I had a Glock to even put my hands on\nBefore I had the dough to put my fams on\nBefore I had rocks sealed in pink tops, tryna get a gram off\nA wild adolescent, raised by the street\nMesmorized by the dealers and the places they eat\nAnd when they blazed the heat, I was the shorty to take the handoff\nRun upstairs, tryna sneak the gat past grandmoms\nThis is how it should be done... my life...\nIs identical to none, son tryed to duplicate but I knew he was fake\nCuz everytime I walked by he turned blue in the face\nI'm like heavy on the leg when I pop\nAll my change is like heavy on the weight when I cop\nIt's just the way it's done\nNiggas tell me they respect the way I blaze them guns\nOn hold it down for the Bronx in the name of Pun\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Fat Joe]\nYeah uh, my name ring bells like a P.O\nPut the pressure on a nigga like I'm right atcha do'\nWith the muzzle out, nigga can't shoke with my dough\nI'm at his mothers house\nBeat up his pops, put the pistol in his brother's mouth\nWave bricks, whips... jerked a few coke and next play the strip\nWith chrome knowin that they won't forget\nAnd on the weekends we shut down clubs\nYou know them crazy Peurto Ricans always fuckin it up!\nIf I can't afford it, I'mma extort it\nIf I can't cut it, I'mma bake it\nStrip you niggas butt-naked, I'm a thoroughbred\nCarry guns and pump heroin\nNever went O.T. I'm too light for Maryland\nI'd rather play the streets of New York\nWhere the fiends are guarunteed to keep the meat on my fork\nI'm just a hustler - feds put the tap\nOn our phones in hopes of cuffin us\nThen wonder why we livin life so illustrious\n\n[Hook] repeat 2x", "title": "Definition of a Don"}]}
