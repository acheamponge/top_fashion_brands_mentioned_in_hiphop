What a way to finish!\n\n[Kendrick Lamar]\nKobe\nNever meaningless could never mean less\nThat's what he means at this moment\nAll season has been his goodbye\nHim to us, us to him, to the whole world\n\n[Sample from untitled 07]\n\nStill got magic, but he made it magical\nFrom Compton to Crenshaw\nJack to Jeanie\nWe were all witnesses\nTo all things that was him\nI mean, we shared with him the world\n\n[Announcer]\nKobe, inside the three point arc...\nKobe Bryant has hit a shot at the buzzer!\n\n[Kobe Bryant]\nWOO!\n\n[Kendrick Lamar]\nSoon enough, he became our identity\nIf you wasn't born and raised here\nOr never lived here\nYou probably would never understand\nI'm-a make sure you do\n\nI'm talking about the 81 points\nI'm talking about the afro\nI'm talking about the alleyoop to Shaq\nThe off-glass buzzer beater over D-Wade\nThe game four overtime takeover in the Finals\n\nKobe\nI'm talking about the posterizing of Steve Nash\nI'm talking about Dwight Howard's rookie year when he got baptized\nYou remember that\nKobe bodied him\nThe helicopter\nThe five parades\nKobe\n\n[Sample from untitled 07]\n\nThe mashed-up gamut of emotions with you and with ourselves is so deep\nI don't think nobody can break that bond\nSo I ask, how do empires last when there's no longer an emperor?\nI mean, we got you\nBut at the same time, we got you\nI'm talking about your blood, your sweat, your tears\nEven your DNA is placed in these L.A. concretes, man\nAnd nothing would ever replace that or erase that\nForever great in our hearts\nSo with that being said\nKnow that it's never goodbye\nIt's simply respect due\nOur due, forever\nKobe"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
