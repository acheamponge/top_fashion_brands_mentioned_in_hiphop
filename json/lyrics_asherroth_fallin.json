Fa real? Oh it's all good\nCause like this, when I tried it, liked it\nFlipped it, hyped it, insisted the mic\nCause this shit's just right\nJust like that, 9th grade footy heard\nStraight from the Philly burbs, feel me? pretty sure\nSuburban Threat was the name and we really were\nSteady wasting the day spittin' silly verses\nNo curses, writing bout our girlfriends\nBallpoint pen, mines spinning like a whirlwind\nGetting on the mic, I'm a wizard like merlin\nBreaking barriers, tearing walls like it's berlin\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd I think it was the summer of 12th grade\nWhen Uncle C passed away, leaving us empty\nAnd it hurt real bad\nDisturbed real sad\nBut we had to move on\nSo infact, real fast, we wrote this song\nBout fallen ones and miscues and misviews\nOf the misuse of words used to diss dudes\nSo true, in a serious face\nI'm convinced God works in mysterious ways\nLike everything happens for a reason\nI had to believe it cause that would explain why they leave us\nAs in people that mean everything\nI got love for them all, they'll be there if I fall but\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2009-04-20"}]}
