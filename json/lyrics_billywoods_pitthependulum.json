Vordul Mega - \u201cPit & the Pendulum\u201d\n[Emcee(s): billy woods and Vordul Mega]\n[Producer(s): 007 (AKA Bond)]\n\n[Verse 1: billy woods]\nThis is what matters\nIf the world shatters, it\u2019s on you to pick up\nThe shards, put \u2018em back together or cut deep\nInto the scars.  Somebody call the guards\nMidnight in the mental.  Pulled over in the\nRental and roamed the crossroads with only one\nShot like crossbows.  [?]\nCouldn\u2019t pray harder.  No atheists\nIn foxholes, just unwilling martyr.  Oh\nHeavenly Father, I could have played smarter\nAll this talk who thugging, you\nBugging.  Vor\u2019 come through, slap your moms in the\nOnion, you won\u2019t do nothing.  Put you in\nThe oven, strip your sis, put you in the dungeon\nLift your sacks, spread those cheeks, nigga\nNow who thugging?  Nightmares\nWithout sleeping, clock steady creeping\n\n[Bridge: billy woods]\nThis is what matters.  Everybody\nFalls\u2014it\u2019s how you land.  Kind of like\nSnakes and Ladders.  Once they started shooting\nEverybody else scattered\n\n[Verse 2: Vordul Mega]\nExploring freedoms\nOn highways weeded, stresses get\nLeft behind, (Skating) skating\nThousands of miles, blow out clouds, drowning\nHenning crown with lobster shield\nLiving in risk, trying to get out of momma\u2019s\nHouse and into cribs.  Too many memories\nOf families at windows shedding\nTears\u2014that never helps.  No one living\nIn fear as the only thing to fear is self\nAwakening from falling in deep depressions\nYou can\u2019t worry why skies is blues\nOnly wonder why my hands is tied\nFrom all the bullshit caught in my mind\nBut I can\u2019t let it fall all on me\nIt feels like someone else helped put it\nThere.  Entrapments from ways we live\nEntrapments from ways we live\n\n[Verse 3: billy woods]\nAt the wake, I had my first pair of dress shoes\nNo black pants, so I wore navy-\n-blue.  She asked me, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d  \u201cShit\nGirl, time flew, everybody did\nWhat they do.  He gone\u2014next, it\u2019s me or\nYou or them too.  Blunts?\nYeah, we smoked a few.  Been on\nThe precipice, girl, I\u2019m a pessimist\u201d\nWe slept together but only kissed\nStormy weather Spitamatic for worse\nOr better.  Lighting\nSticks, pulling cheap wine\nEvery nigga I know that close to losing their mind\nWalking fine lines of moonshine\nWe\u2019re all doing time\nThis system will make you a cog\nBrothers wandering in fogs\nBurning through the smog.  Lost\nHighways we drive.  Something died\nFrustration just boiling inside\nReady to go outside, just ride\nBurn a nigga something awful\nI\u2019m not partial\nPass the bottle\nStep it on it, man, choke the throttle\nThe night in a rental\nPulled over in the mental\nThis is what matters\nThis is what matters"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
