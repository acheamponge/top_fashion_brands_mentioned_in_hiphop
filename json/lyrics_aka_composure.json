{"songs": [{"title": "Composure", "lyrics": "[Intro:]\nOne, two, one, two\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhy you gassin', dawg?\nWhy you comin' to my table without askin', dawg?\nI know you hate me with a passion, I ain't mad at y'all\nI know you fuck with every classic in my catalog\nAnd it go worth your magazine team think it's LootLove\nCashtime with the Sheen Team, push dust\nI don't need a green screen when I pull stunts\nCause when you the real thing, nigga's get touched\nAnd it's Super unlocked, unlocked\nI don't give a fuck about your number one spot\nCorporate's sleeping on me, need to set alarm clocks\nWord to all my Naija homies getting telecom guap\nIn the billboards\nThat's the shit that I kill for\nBig dreams since I was a lil' boy\nI'm stressed\nMiddle finger to the press\nTried to give a fuck but I ain't got a fuck left\nI'm blessed\nLet me ball like the Ballon d'Or\nForbes, if you ever fall it's a cannonball\nMiss me with the bullshit like a Matador\nI just hope you're that involved when the camera off\nBang, bang, bang, and it's all about the moola\nBig shout out to Sbuda, smoking Buddha in Abuja\nTunnel vision got me thinking future like computers\n20 bitches swimming in the pool like barracuda\nMaybe I should spit something we can build with\nI think we all need change, who got the till slip?\nIt's way beyond Drake and Meek Mill shit\nFuck a fiance, I got a lil' kid\nEven Ricky called me the other day\nStuck in the middle, it's sad that we can't collaborate\nTried to be civil until I saw your Twitter page\nBut I was out in Europe doing bigger things\nSee, when it rains, it pours\nUnderstand with me, when it's war, it's war\nThinking back, you wasn't even national yet\nMatter fact, I used to be a fan of your shit\nYoung King, I should've took you under my wing\nInstead I let you under my skin\nI know coming up is a wonderful thing\nBut even I get uncomfortable when they call me the King\nI know you play like you humble but we just one and the same\nYou tryna stay out of trouble and I'm just stuck in my lane\nI hope the pressure don't make me buckle, so much on my plate\nAppetite for destruction, this shit is like a buffet, hey, hey, hey\n\n[Hook]\nHold it now, hold it now, hold it now\nThis ain't your moment, we own it now\nYou feelin' some type of way\nThey gon' ask me what this song about\nComposure, composure\nComposure, composure\nHmmm, know yourself\nI'm from the future, let's take it back to the music\nCause I can't control myself\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy nigga's on the road fucking crazy bitches\nI be on my phone looking through my baby pictures\nThat's what the fuck you call a juxtaposition\nHad enough of these clubs but they don't wanna miss it\nAll the baes blow me kisses\nDrinkin' champagne just to piss it\nNigga's been saying all my shit authentic\nEvery Trinidad James get your fifteen minutes\nHeard your new release, put that shit on fast-forward\nCaptain of my team, this a contact sport\nThis is combat, need a ball sack for it\nThis a marathon track, all the boys on 'roids\nTime to hit the road, pull your money up\nWent gold but you niggas did it funny style\nKO didn't even try to floss with it\nSaying, \"Oh,\" when you with it like a boss nigga\nAll this talk about God, I'mma show you hell\nBring it to your face like L'Oreal\nMy niggas in position when they ring the bell\nThey gonna get your ponytail like the Holy grail\nThat's the problem with you new school cats\nTook your whole style from 'Malumkoolkat\nI got my hands in the dirt\nSuch a pity that you can't dance on the verse\n\n[Hook]\nHold it now, hold it now, hold it now\nThis ain't your moment, we own it now\nYou feelin' some type of way\nThey gon' ask me what this song about\nComposure, composure\nComposure, composure\nHmmm, know yourself\nI'm from the future, let's take it back to the music\nCause I can't control myself\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm the reason niggas had \"The Saga\" on repeat\nNow you wanna charge me eighty thousand for a beat?\nLoad it up on data file, put it on wax\nStreets on smash but your video trash\nLately I been going through some changes\nTryna figure out where I let my momma down\nCause the mother of my child is a angel\nDo I blame it on myself or this fame shit?\nBusy putting in the hours, final touches to the album\nWhen I should have bought you flowers and a bracelet\nNow we gotta make different living arrangements\nAll the family gonna see this shit in the papers\nMy father telling me, \"Don't make the same mistakes\"\nComing home late and the plate's in the microwave\nNow you got your very own baby face\nWe were so in love back in '88, anyway\nI don't give a fuck what you say to me\nAll you bitches in the club look the same to me\nI'mma need a double cup like a major league\nWhy you tryna front like you ain't afraid of me?\nSuper mega touch down every city you go\nHeard you moving up now in the city of gold\nWhen I go to Maftown, I'mma sit on the throne\nTryna fill up the dome, 'bout to fill up your home, oh\n\n[Hook]\nHold it now, hold it now, hold it now\nThis ain't your moment, we own it now\nYou feelin' some type of way\nThey gon' ask me what this song about\nComposure, composure\nComposure, composure\nHmmm, know yourself\nI'm from the future, let's take it back to the music\nCause I can't control myself", "year": "2015-09-09",
