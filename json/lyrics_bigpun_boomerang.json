Ha ha, top of the world!\")\n\n[Chorus]\nYo, this is the bad time - boomerang, bring it all back\nFlashback, live and prosper, eat well and get fat\nI was Pop Dula, popular to the masses\nI miss the E-Classes, rocking game with death glasses\nRock bottom struck and threw my world off its axis\nBoomerang - plan to come back like Bronx rap\nStorm like the Redcoats through anything in my path\nFirst you shine like sterling, then you broke like brick in Berlin\n\n[Verse 2: Big Pun]\nNow should I slit my wrists, go for it all or call it quits\nPicture me taking my life, leaving my wife and my daughter shit\nWish I could slip back, and switch the memories\nLift the felonies from my record and respected my enemies\nLive like the Kennedies, above the law\nFuck 'em all, I'm coming for the rich thieving 'em even if I wasn't poor\nI seen it all like I said before\nThe streets are for men at war and the beasts are the predators\nI shed it all first and be the primary source\nOf course, I bury any adversary trying to floss\nJust because, the reason I leave 'em lost in the sauce\nTeeing off like we up North just for being soft\nA beaten horse like a slave getting minimum wage\nFeeling the gauge, front page, these are the last days\nCash pays, and rules - the root of all evil\nShooting amigos for loot and perico polluting our people\nMoving kilos like it's all good through every ghetto\nI ain't judging, but bugging how we fall so many levels\nThe devils got us by the balls\nThat's why the law allows the drugs to overflood, knowing we gonna buy it all\nIt's time to call a world order where every girl's your daughter\nAnd priceless as ices and pearls fresh out the water\nI'm gonna get mine, either from crime, or through the Bible\nWhichever way, it better pay, I'm feeling suicidal\n\n[Chorus]\nYo, this is the bad time - boomerang, bring it all back\nFlashback, live and prosper, eat well and get fat\nI was Pop Dula, popular to the masses\nI miss the E-Classes, rocking game with death glasses\nRock bottom struck and threw my world off its axis\nBoomerang - plan to come back like Bronx rap\nStorm like the Redcoats through anything in my path\nFirst you shine like sterling, then you broke like brick in Berlin"}], "artist": "Big Pun"}
