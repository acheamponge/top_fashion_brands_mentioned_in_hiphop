You booty rappers get penalized, and expedited\nCause dey don't think about they shit, before they write it\nWe don't sell narcotics with the po-po problems, playboy take a look\nWe off into real estate, CD's, millions of wealth\nUsed to be crooks still hang around crooks, dealers and ex-cons\nNiggas with Luke's and ?? ?? shirt on\nPlayers with cake, pushin they weight, try to find the last trap\n'fore they bloody wrecked illegal corporate scratch\nWhat they buck?\n\nChorus\n\n[C-Bo]\nAre y'all fools ready for dis? It's a loco for sure I'll blast\nWith Billy Loco and 40-Water we take your life then we haul ass\nTall cash stacked in the basement\nCan't leave the house with less than a zip an a extra clip\nNiggas wanna know why I get down like this ain't that a bitch?\nYou see my, life on TV cause it's the daddy with the ?? and a P\nNiggas just can't seem to get away from PD while they surrounded me\nAnd houndin me cause I ball hard, on parole and a double-R\nFifty to a hundred G's and je-wels on wrists\nNigga we ghetto stars\nShit my niggas spent G's to push, drop Bentleys\nRemi Mark sippin, Cristal, X-O Hennesey\nAnd better believe when we enemies we spray wit these\nEvery night at twelve have your whole motherfuckin city prayin on knees\nAnd still 40-Water pass the strap and I blast, still hit the gas\nHad to tear his whole motherfuckin head off tryin to ?? the stash\nEvery man they all man, quick to pull a lick out the Brougham\nOnly reason I rode down on that bitch ass nigga, is because I can!\n\nChorus"}]}
