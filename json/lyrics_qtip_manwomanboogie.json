(Make it easy)\nGood God, make it easier now\n(Good God, make it easier now)\nGet down... (Man and woman get down)\nGood God, make it easier now\n(Good God, make it easier now)\nGet down... (Man and woman get down)\nA-doogah-doogah-doogah-doogah-dah doo\n\n[Q-Tip]\nMan and woman be patrollin the earth\nPuttin shit in the game\nCitizens of the world, we runnin out\nPrecious time is a grain of sand\nIgnored by the hand\n(Work hard man everyday)\nWork hard man everyday\n(For who?) For another man's plan\nMan orders woman when he come home\n\"Getcha ass in the air!\"\n(My woman wants it just as much as I do)\nWoman wants it just as much as he does\nBut makes as if she don't care\nMan and woman in the same where I'm from\nWe havin things on the mind\nMinimum wage and the internet page\n(She cry) Protect themselves from crime\nThe bluest collar on the brownest of skin\nWhite, yellow, red too\nThey don't care who it is\nThey watching you\nConspiracies, so you might as well dance\nGettin down, Zulu\nMan and woman, yo you might as well dance\nGettin down, Zulu, c'mon, c'mon\n\n[Hook: Amanda Diva & (Q-Tip)]\nGettin down is somethin to do between woman and man\nOne minute we're so far apart and then, together we stand\nGettin down is somethin to do between woman and man\nOne minute we're so far apart and then, together we stand\nMen and women, what's goin on...inside of our minds?\n(Oh no, sing it one more time, c'mon)\nGettin down is somethin to do between woman and man\nOne minute we're so far apart and then, together we stand\n\n[Verse 2: Q-Tip]\nCheck it out\nRed man was the first on the continent\nThis you gotta understand\nWoman not behind, she's right beside him there\nAnd they both toil land\nWhite man fightin for independance from, an old empire\nWoman makes a flag for a new nation and\nLets the flag raise high\nBlack woman is stripped of her kingdom and\nBought the breastfeeding new\nBlack man, mentally, he broken too\nBut the cream always rise to the top\nThat's what men and women do\nMan, woman, always doin the dance\nOne wops, one pops\nWe'd be lucky if we both find a groove\nThat we both can lock\nCan man be stronger if a woman was there?\nI would have to say yes\nCan woman make it without men being there?\nShe would have to be blessed\nWoman and man are the spiritual forces\nBrought together to live\nGood thing there's many of us here in the world today\nFind a good one to give, let's go, c'mon\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Amanda Diva and Q-Tip]\nGood God make it easier now\nGet down\nGood God make it easier now\nGet down\nA-doogah-doogah-doogah-doogah-dah doo\nGet down"}], "artist": "Q-Tip"}
