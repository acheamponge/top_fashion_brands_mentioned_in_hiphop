'cause Curry play his cards well\nNinja turtle bullets, so you know that be a hard shell\nIf them other few niggas try to harm me\nThen that just proves that I'm a one man army\nNever hated people that be putting in work\nAll you underground niggas just competing for dirt\nEarth, I'm down to it which explains why I'm blessing bitch\nThe greater the power I possess, that\u2019s an exorcist\n\n[Interlude]\nAh shit, I fucked up, I fucked up\nBut aye, can we keep going?\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy nigga came through, rolled a spliff\nAnd I'm finna go and lift into the heavens\nI don't really give a fuck, I'm lucky number seven\nIf I shoot a number seven then there's gonna be eight\nI don't really give a fuck, all you rappers get ate\nLike meals, nigga, I want mills, nigga, you chase deals\nNigga, I just killed everything that you own\nI don't really give a fuck, I'm gone\nI got Dat $tick, 'cause I got that shit\nLike I'm living in the woods, I'm a bear in this bitch\nYeah, I fuck really bare in this bitch\nI don't really give a fuck, what I'ma wear in this shit\nLike uh, ya'll know everything that's going on\nI don't really give a fuck, nigga, I'm just flowing on\nLike water rapids, nigga, I'm just rappin'\nI don't really give a fuck, I'm about to go in, ah!"}], "artist": "Denzel Curry"}
