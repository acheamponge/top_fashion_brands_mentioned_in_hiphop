Twenty eight grams\n\n[Chorus: Havoc]\nI see her gettin' money, hold a nigga down if she feelin' you\nOnly loyal to money, the only thing she appealin' to\nAppetite for goons, life on the edge\nNo jumpin' the [?], just jumpin' bed to bed\nAmerica's nightmare, fat ass, pretty face\nBut you better watch her, the safe in a different place\nGo 'head sleep, nigga, they stickin' you for the safe\nShe made you feel good but, nah, you ain't safe"}]}
