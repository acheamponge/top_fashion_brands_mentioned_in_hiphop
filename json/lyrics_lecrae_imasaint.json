So because we satisfied the wrath of God, the beef has been crushed, now we got a new identity, called a saint\n\n[Verse 1]\nYup!\nHey, hey\nUsed to be where I could only trust me and myself\nAnd in that heavy metal Devil that would send me straight to Hell wit' it\nThought it was no helping it\nSelfishness was celibate\nI'd sell a bit, but I'd make sure I don't sit up in that cell a bit\nYell a bit only when hurt came for certain\nIlliterate, ain't know that the Word came\nThen that Word hit me and unblinded me\nJesus paid a price for me\nThat's how I gained the right to be the son of God I'd like to be\nChanged my heart, gave me a desire for His work, man\nKill me if you want, but I'm gon' get back out that dirt, man\nNot yet what I'm gonna be, but not what I used to be\nI bless His name forever Who would chose me and start using me\nUsed to love my sinning full of greed, full of hate\nI might say that I loved Jesus but that talk was really fake\nI'd be lusting for ya cousin if it wasn't for His Grace\nYeah, he took me outta nothing and He made ya boy a saint\n\n[Hook]\nYeah, they tell me sugarcoat it, dumb it down but I can't\nMight as well deny the Christ, be ashamed, but I ain't\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\n'Til the day I see the grave I'm going hard in the paint\nIt's the only we hope we got, that's why I'll die for my faith\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou got to understand Jesus agreed back in eternity\nTo sign a bloody covenant and take a deadly turn for me\nHe ain't just agreed, fulfilled it to the death of Him\nTook that bloody cup that's meant for us straight to the neck and yeah\nSwallowed all that bitterness, pain, and affliction\nAin't a soul in Hell with pain comparable to this one\nBrought me to repentance, homie, I'm blood purchased\nDaily I'm conformed to His holiness so I worship\nJesus finished the work, He resurrected on high\nThat means that He beat death, and best believe so will I\nSee some believe they can fly, but I believe I can die\nResurrect, leave the Earth, and live forever with God\nHe will march through the sky while the stars sing His praises\nPlanets dance around while the universe is amazed and\nMe I get to gaze upon His beauty for days, man\nIf I could be anything, baby, I'd be a saint\n\n[Hook]\nYeah, they tell me sugarcoat it, dumb it down but I can't\nMight as well deny the Christ, be ashamed, but I ain't\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\n'Til the day I see the grave I'm going hard in the paint\nIt's the only we hope we got, that's why I'll die for my faith\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\n\n[Spoken]\n1 Corinthians Chapter 1, Paul calls one of the worst churches in the New Testament saints. Not because of man's choosing, but clearly becuase of God's choosing through the Lord, Jesus Christ\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow, now you might think I'm crazy like some kinda urban misfit\nBut first I hated church, I'd only pray to get my wish list\nI'd be just like you, \"doin'-my-dance-up-in-the- club\" folk\nI promise I ain't choose it, I was chosen to loved on\nEyes low, blowin' dro, that's the life I used to know\nBut Jesus chopped me up and slowed me down just like that Houston flow\nA dead man 'til somebody hit me with the hardest facts\nThe Gospel hit my heart, I guess that's what you call a heart attack\nI'm looking at Ephesians 2 like, \"What did Jesus see in you?\"\nIt's nothin' by His grace He chose to love on folk like me and you\nAnd I don't understand it, homie, I never planned it\nI was chasing money and fast women and, man, then\nI met the great I am, Son of Man or the Lamb\nSnatched ya boy up outta Hell and got me workin' for His plans\nUsed think I was the man 'til I met Him\nAll that arrogance and pride, I dead 'em and fo'get 'em, I'm a saint\n\n[Hook]\nYeah, they tell me sugarcoat it, dumb it down but I can't\nMight as well deny the Christ, be ashamed, but I ain't\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\n'Til the day I see the grave I'm going hard in the paint\nIt's the only we hope we got, that's why I'll die for my faith\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)\nI'm a saint (I'm a saint)"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
