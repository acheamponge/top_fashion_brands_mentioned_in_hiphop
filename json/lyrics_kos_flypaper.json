I think we maybe forgot?\nBut never mind that, we like to party\nWe don't start trouble and we don't bother nobody\n'Cause Y is a letter with a long long tail\nAnd I write these lyrics you can feel like brail\nHail, the most high, I post high\nI used to swing low, now I let the crabs know that\nMy antimatter is shattering any ladder thats crawling with snakes\nMake no mistake we not fake, wake up\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nOoh, got stuck, ooh, FlyPaper\nI don't care, I don't care\nWho's that girl? She's FlyPaper\nShe don't care, she don't care"}], "artist": "\u200bk-os"}
