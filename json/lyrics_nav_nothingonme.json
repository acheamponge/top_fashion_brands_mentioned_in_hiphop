I can't help you\nJust cause I say I trust you that don't mean I don't doubt you\nYou wanna change your life you gotta change the people around you\nI just fucked your bitch, she said \"I'm so glad that I found you\"\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nI made her pop a pill then I made her pop another one\nPassed out on your bitch and when I woke up she had nothing on (she had nothing on)\nI could drop ten hits and they gon' say they want another one\nShitting on my name because i made it, they ain't nothing on\n\n[Hook]\nThey got nothing on me\nThey got nothing on, they got nothing on\nThey got nothing on me\nThey got nothing on, they got nothing on\nThey got nothing on me\nThey got nothing on, they got nothing on\nThey got nothing on me\nThey got nothing on, they got nothing on\nThey got nothing on me\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey see the money coming my way\nNow these bitches all in my face\nYou got nothing on me, shouldn't have stunted on me\nNow they wanna see me cause I'm getting paid\nAlways feel better when in L.A\nCause they wanna do something where I stay\nI gotta live forever cause I can't be replaced\nMy shoota 15, 16 on his waist\nSay the wrong thing and I might get you blowed up\nAll these bitches wanna see a brown boy glow up\nRemember me and Frost on the road eating cold cuts\nNow when I'm feeling down all I ever do is pour up\nI was in the Honda bumping Kiss Land\nMet Abel and he told me I'm a sick man\nI'm gonna spend like 20K on a wristband\nIf I see your girl, yeah, she might go missing\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nI made her pop a pill then I made her pop another\nPassed out on your bitch and when I woke up she had nothing on\nI could drop ten hits and they gon' say they want another one\nShitting on my name because on me they have nothing on\n\n[Hook]\nThey got nothing on me\nThey got nothing on, they got nothing on\nThey got nothing on me\nThey got nothing on, they got nothing on\nThey got nothing on me\nThey got nothing on, they got nothing on\nThey got nothing on me\nThey got nothing on, they got nothing on\nThey got nothing on me"}], "artist": "NAV"}
