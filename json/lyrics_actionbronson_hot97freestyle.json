Everything's a movie, I jump in the jacuzzi with that green Coogi\nThe plane lift up, it's like that body, boy, chain lift up\nCrimes committed with no hiccups\nAh! That thing thing, shred your stomach like sit-ups\nYou'll never sit up or shit from your butt\nThey say I'm crazy and deranged, but fuck, I can handle that\nI crack the whip right from the camels back\nMy head is wrapped like Yasser Arafat\nAnd I don't sleep no more, it's only fuckin' power naps\n\n[verse 2: Acapella]\nIt's so easy to be looked over, I never look sober\nLook through the eyes of a soldier, I look fly in a Rover\nLions and cobras, keep the iron in the toga\nSend a message, leave you lying over\nBitches crushing on the kid so now they flying over\nHalf of the world to get wrapped up in pearls\nJust like the Queen of England, I stay wavy\nMercedes color, Wayne Brady, it's me baby, please baby\nAin't nobody taking my spot, that's on my mother, kid\nCross my heart and hope to die, that's on some other shit\nThis motherfuckin' kid be coveted\nDifferent types of silks is what I'm covered with\nBaby I'm lovin' it, your boy is hotter than an oven mitt\nIf I was broke then you'd be running your shit\nPoke your kidney with the knife I cut the onion with\nThen poach your kidneys with some onions and shit\nIt's me\n\n[Verse 3]\nLeft, right, ayo I've never been a plaintiff, ever\nWhat, what, what...I don't fuck with this I'm done\n\n[Acapella]\nMy lawyer tackle the case like he play for the Ravens\nSo I stuff 'em with cheese like a Danish\nDamn I crave paper, catch me later at the Laker game, I bet a grip\nOn the Knicks, Carmelo sweating on my kicks cause I'm court side\nThis time the good way, \"I'm a free man\" that's what I should say\nNobody holding me back except myself, that's what I feel like\nPeeling a five, now I'm feeling the vibe, hand on the wheel, drugs in my eyes\nMoney in my mind, I think about it all the time\nCause there was a time I never had shit, now I got shit\nIt's like magic, all these cars in front of the crib look like a Porsche pageant", "title": "Hot 97 Freestyle", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/4c92d833aae01e64b71a556bb1cb9f0b.990x660x1.jpg", "year": "2014-08-07"}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
