Timeless, the Truth will amaze ya\nEuphemisms be like euthanasia we through with the flavors\nI read your blueprint watch you take the foolish steps\nYou don't deserve my cents if you was UNICEF\nThe Judas left the Southern sun and god for thirty pieces\nAll my thesis to the wisest recognize the dirty features\nWe working on getting work in\nYou hear the shotty bursting with Lonnie be lurking\nSay your prayers like Donnie McClurkin\nWe fly to the grave site like kamikazes\nAnd maintain the same brain frame as Hammurabi's\nSo paraprofessionals know I'm a be skeptical\nNever handing out respect unless it's exceptional\nYo just be strategic or get broke into pieces\nBy murderous paragraphs that'll leave you paraplegic\n\n[Hook X2]", "title": "Ceviche", "album": "Bon Appetit.....
