Get this paper out this rap game\nThese rappers faking, but yo homie, I be spitting flames\nThese niggas know me, ain't no phony, I was born to hustle\nSo watch me get it out this business, watch these pussies struggle\nGood in the tussle, flex my muscle, but I'm being subtle\nBlitz and befuddle, sendin' rumbles from the [?] muzzle\nI gritty guzzle, I goes hard off the liquor bottle\nKing of my jungle, I worked hard to make it from the bottom\nMy niggas [?] so regardless, I'ma see figures\nThis rap thing a simple game, man it's easy nigga\nIt ain't no [?], tryna sees a nigga\nIt's open season, ain't no reason nigga, I ain't eatin' nigga\nI'm underground and putting it down, I'm just payin' dues\nBut I'm comin' and I'm [?], I'm a damn fool\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne & Big Scoob]\nI move with the night\nI've been chasing paper, gettin' it, pushin' and makin' moves, nigga\nI've been hustlin' all my life\nEver since I can remember, been hustlin' and payin' dues, nigga\nI move with the night\nI've been chasing paper, gettin' it, pushin' and makin' moves, nigga\nI've been hustlin' all my life\nEver since I can remember, been hustlin' and payin' dues, nigga\n\n[Verse 2: T-Nutty]\nAh! See, I've been creepy crawlin' through the night\nClimbin' the wall like Spider-Man [?] went up with me\nCome fuck with me\nSee, I be on another height in the air\nSometimes I be floatin' like a kite, up-uppity\nI can't sleep, so money hungry, don't got time to play\nBustin' knocks at the two o'clock in the morning with my grimy face\nBefore I stepped the foot in the game I had to tie me lace\nJust like all of the rest of the niggas just tryna get figures and find some space\nCatch me in the cuts, hangin' out like bigger nuts\nNighttime is the right time to dig a hole big enough for you niggas tryna show stop\n'Specially on the four block\nYou can ask my dogs, I'm a hog, not a pork chop\nNutty the black knight, hustle to make the stack right\nCreepin' through the dark on you haters, making the mack right\nNigga get your flashlight, you can't see me without it\nI doubt it, in a game tryna get something out it\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne & Big Scoob]\nI move with the night\nI've been chasing paper, gettin' it, pushin' and makin' moves, nigga\nI've been hustlin' all my life\nEver since I can remember, been hustlin' and payin' dues, nigga\nI move with the night\nI've been chasing paper, gettin' it, pushin' and makin' moves, nigga\nI've been hustlin' all my life\nEver since I can remember, been hustlin' and payin' dues, nigga\n\n[Verse 3: Big Scoob]\nI started small town dope game, cocaine\nPushin' rocks on the block, you niggas know me mane\nI switched the game and jumped the lane but I'm still goin' hard\nI pushed the line, so give me mine, watch you niggas starve\nA beast and [?], I'm a heathen, I hear niggas eatin'\nSo I ain't leavin', I'm proceedin' like a hungry vegan\nI'm puttin' cabbage like a savage, let a nigga at it\nI got a habit, gotta have it or I'm causin' damage\nI'm extra manish, causin' panic like an epidemic\nI need your sammich, nigga hand it, you return to famish\nTook it for granted, plot and planned it\nNow I'm here demandin'\nHella [?], understand it or you get the cannon\nDon't get me wrong I ain't speakin' on no hater shit\nBut I ain't playin', I'm just sayin', I need paper quick\nI used to chase it, duckin' cases in the dark of night\nBut now I chase it in your faces [?] in limelight\n\n[Hook: Tech N9ne & Big Scoob]\nI move with the night\nI've been chasing paper, gettin' it, pushin' and makin' moves, nigga\nI've been hustlin' all my life\nEver since I can remember, been hustlin' and payin' dues, nigga\nI move with the night\nI've been chasing paper, gettin' it, pushin' and makin' moves, nigga\nI've been hustlin' all my life\nEver since I can remember, been hustlin' and payin' dues, nigga"}], "artist": "Big Scoob"}
