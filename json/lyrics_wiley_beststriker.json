Rough tackle who?\nShoulder barge who? I'll shoulder barge you\nWhat'd you mean? Take on six, not two\nAnd I reach the goal box, that's you\nI'm a [banger?]\nKeeper don't bother, I'll slide it past you\nI work on the pitch, never been a goal hanger\nFans hold up my name on banners\nTop player in the game, I'm nothing like you\n\n[Chorus: Scorcher]\nBecause I'm the best striker the scene's ever seen\nI like [?]\nAnd if I play right back, I'll be moving the scene\nI didn't wanna use [?]\nBecause in the middle of the park, I run tings\nFrom fifty-yards I done tings\nI score goals in a season\nPray your goalie season\n\n[Verse 3: Little Dee]\nYeah, aye, listen, yeah, yeah, yeah\nIt's nuts when I get on the pitch (Why?)\nI'm a sore loser, I'm cutting the ref and his kids\nI played for team one time and it was sponsored by Nike\nSo I packed my bags and left with the kits\nAnd they say that I play too rough\nBut you blame me, I'm used to nutmeg\nPlus you can slide tackle foul and all that\nWatch after the game, I'm holding the grudge\nYour face all over my studs\nStar of the team, you're going for sub\nWhole ninety minutes with my lines switched up\nGotta get back to grime, my bruv\nBut when I get off the pitch to get back in the streets\nI still got a football mind\nFive inside rules, don't shoot in my area\nPenalties giving out, whole of your team's getting fired\n\n[Chorus: Scorcher]\nBecause I'm the best striker the scene's ever seen\nI like [?]\nAnd if I play right back, I'll be moving the scene\nI didn't wanna use [?]\nBecause in the middle of the park, I run tings\nFrom fifty-yards I done tings\nI score goals in a season\nPray your goalie season\nBecause I'm the best striker the scene's ever seen\nI like [?]\nAnd if I play right back, I'll be moving the scene\nI didn't wanna use [?]\nBecause in the middle of the park, I run tings\nFrom fifty-yards I done tings\nI score goals in a season\nPray your goalie season", "image": "https://images.genius.com/69962f266a3b134c548bf544c8c645de.700x700x1.jpg", "album": "Tunnel Vision Volume 6", "title": "Best Striker"}]}
