I was thinking how and for what\nBut reality bites like a thousand mutts\nNothing worse than the person that's foul with guts\nTo stick you quicker...\n\n[Verse 3: Memphis Bleek]\n...This brand new nigga\nYup, this is the foulest\nThis ain't Hollywood, it's the Wild West\nWhoever guns is the loudest\nThat's who's the best, now take ten steps and draw\nWho dope can take ten steps and remain raw\nWho has no regards for the law?\nMe that's who, now let me ask you\nDid you not know if we all don't eat\nSome day that we all would beef?\nDid you know about the crabs in the barrel\nThey would hear me creep\nIt's a motherfucking war in these streets\n\n[Chorus 2: Memphis Bleek]\nI'm from the ghetto to the ghetto\nAnd I'm back again I'm back again\nI'm from the ghetto to the ghetto\nAnd I'm back again, I'm back again\n\n[Chorus 1: Jay-Z]\nFrom Marcy to Hollywood\nAnd back again, and back again\nFrom Marcy to Hollywood\nAnd back again, and back again\n\n[Verse 4: Sauce Money]\nAs a youth I used to fold up\nOld heads said I thought more like a leader than a soldier\nBack in the days never no heat thought shit was cool\nGood cat personified even went to school\nLearned wild shit made me feel kinda live\nOff of nothing with this bullshit 9 to 5\nI stayed broke made me easier to provoke\nReady to yoke the first motherfucker that joked\nSame dude with the hard bottom\nWent from laid back to loc'd out\nFrom talk it over to Todd shot him\nReady to perish all the shit you cherish\nLeave you the wettest I got a \"You die first\" fetish\nI can recall helping old chicks across the street\nNow I help myself lifting cats off they feet\nCan't give a fuck nigga, I just lost my moms\nWhy I need to feel something steel in both my arms\n\n[Chorus 3: Sauce Money]\nI went from Marcy to Hollywood\nAnd back again, and back again\nI went from Marcy to Hollywood\nAnd back again, and back again\n\n[Chorus 2: Memphis Bleek]\nI'm from the ghetto to the ghetto\nAnd I'm back again, I'm back again\nI'm from the ghetto to the ghetto\nAnd I'm back again, I'm back again\n\n[Chorus 1: Jay-Z]\nI went from Marcy to Hollywood\nAnd back again, back again\nFrom Marcy to Hollywood\nAnd back again, back again\n\n[Outro: Jay-Z]\nUh huh uh geah since y'all niggas don't like to think\nI'ma make it real easy for y'all\nYou got three different types of nigga\nFirst cat, as a youth is real wild\nFor whatever reason he hit the money or whatever\u2014cooled out\nYou got one cat that's ghetto, grimy always remained ghetto\nYou know that type\nThen, you got one cat very smart young man\nE'rybody wanted him to be a lawyer doctor whatever\nPressure drove him crazy, he wiled out, ha geah...\n...Marcy to Hollywood\nAnd back again, and back again\nBack again, beatch", "title": "Marcy to Hollywood", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7340b4a18007e61809e51a065eac70a8.400x399x1.jpg", "year": "1998-03-17", "album": "The Players Club (Music From and Inspired By the Motion Picture) "}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
