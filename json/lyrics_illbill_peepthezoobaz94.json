Uhh, Peep the Zoobaz (X 4)\n\n(Goretex)\nMy lyrics spread nice over tits like calamine\nUrine into slime when I circumcise your spine\nI swallow Hashish cuz I don't need to grief\nI chew vaginal beef with my Mackey and pull a goatee\nI got a sweet tooth for some PMS leaking\nI'm seeking the bloody tushy of a Puerto Rican\nI'm getting iller than this here jones when I'm stoned\nI'm banging women with nipples like fucking street cones\nI'll leave NYPD blue, I'll asphyxia you too\nMy crew attacks like a pack of crazed Jews\nI'm Shawn Michaels with the hot rod I'm ready\nMy aim is steady, point blank with my vainly machete\nSatanic soldier, mad pages like Janova\nFrom Brooklyn to Boulder a million jiffs be on my shoulder\nI'm all about gored smack, beer back and crack packs\nSnap jacks and anal tracks, god flesh I'm seeing blaaaaack\n\nCan you dig it? Uhh, Peep the Zoobaz (X 8)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2bac33967790d87128fa9676f5b0c7b0.600x600x1.jpg", "album": "The Early Years: Rare Demos \u201991-\u201994", "year": "2003-09-16"}]}
