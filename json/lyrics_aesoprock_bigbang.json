{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Intro]\nWell, so we meet again\n(He said he's grown spiritually\nSince the last time we'd spoken)\n\n[Verse 1]\nOk, this is the dawning of the book of bitter aspects\nWhere the jackals sit and watch the pedagogues clash flesh\nPoison function accompanied by six armor-clad\nBlack horse and buggy mechanisms\nTugged a portion of my severed vision (my severed vision)\nThe gathering of loose ends in a bucket\nWith a shoestring budget\nEvery man's got a field to plow (I know that now)\nBut it's like, man I really can't afford the oxen\nFee fie et cetera\nI smell the warm blood of the bill collector knockin'\nI get awkwardly sturdy with a frigid liquid backbone\nI get swept in the pressure cooker tryin' to paddle back home\nI get sprung with a vibrant alliance of clean intention\nBy eclipsing doom litigants hatched to bash these picket fences\nNow I'll attend the wedding of the open sore and festering\nAnd when the groom presents the ring\nThe bride commence the blistering\nIt's textbook magnificently crude\nPrototype king berserker module\nInserted vertical thirst, burst horizontal (treasure)\nTreasure, loose cannons span the starboard bow\nOf the clipper ship dipped in truth famine pressure (pressure)\nCabin fever meter peggin' ludicrous\nBeautiful cartoon troopers\nSwallow brutal futility with a teaspoon full of sugar\nI rock ready, aim, fire while y'all rock ready, fire, aim\nThen blame the stationary target while the prey escapes the frame\nMerit badge, marksman, or poacher?\nIt's all the same (right?)\nSo I lay across the wood perpendicular to the grain\n\n[Hook]\nI wanna be a big bang, gotta be\nNever bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see a 'Yes sir', sir\nYES SIR!\nThorn with a torn core, sore to the bone\nWarn the other brothers I was born forlorn\nBig bang, Shoveling a big dig\nHuddle in a tunnel of big dreams I think big things\nI'ma burn with this little light of mind\nAnd a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang\n\nI wanna be a big bang, gotta be\nNever bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see a 'Yes sir', sir\nYES SIR!\nThorn with a torn core, sore to the bone\nWarn the other brothers I was born forlorn\nBig bang, Shoveling a big dig\nHuddle in a tunnel of big dreams I think big things\nI'ma burn with this little light of mind\nAnd a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm just a survivor of the woolly mammoth population\nBottle neck effect, sorta born def\nAlien to shallow alchemy\nIf you gon' metamorph the base-metal to precious\nMight as well steal from the rich, bewitch the peasants\nI'm floating this homing pigeon out hell's kitchen window\nLeft an S.O.S. infested bottle nestled in his grip so\nWith a prayer circle release party and hearty wild bellow\nI observed him fly ten feet\nThen drop the bottles to the devils\nFertile circle turned fertile crescent via bad investment\nDespised every second, but I guess I learned my lesson\nIf I made an angel in the snow for every rotting victim\nThere'd be wings to float this mothership up out the goblin system\nSticky panoramic contaminant planted\nIn conjunction with phantom assumption\nGutterbug alumnus candidates\nWell, I promise you I'll man the lighthouse\nJust to help guide in your ship\nIf you promise to help pull this hook out my lip (bitch)\nGodspeed, straitjacketed ragged approach\nTo circle suns via folklore pollutants derived strictly\nFrom a B.C. generation disgust\nCommunity movement alluding to a\n\"No blood given, no recognition\"\nLife manner, I was us up all night with a rusty hammer\nTrying to build a fence around these magic beans\nMy dreams have gathered\nBut to, that certain lack of avail\nI sail a choppy lot with buoyancy like a bucket of rocks (a bucket of rocks)\n\n[Hook]\nI wanna be a big bang, gotta be\nNever bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see a 'Yes sir', sir\nYES SIR!\nThorn with a torn core, sore to the bone\nWarn the other brothers I was born forlorn\nBig bang, Shoveling a big dig\nHuddle in a tunnel of big dreams I think big things\nI'ma burn with this little light of mind\nAnd a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang\n\nI wanna be a big bang, gotta be\nNever bottle me up in a probably, I wanna see a 'Yes sir', sir\nYES SIR!\nThorn with a torn core, sore to the bone\nWarn the other brothers I was born forlorn\nBig bang, Shoveling a big dig\nHuddle in a tunnel of big dreams I think big things\nI'ma burn with this little light of mind\nAnd a prime concern to earn thanks, I'ma be a big bang\n\n[Aesop Rock]\nBig bang, bi-big bang\nIt's gettin' bigger by the second\nCheck it\n\n[Verse 3]\nOk, I'm here to rock the tugboat and bid the elders farewell\nI shook the buddy system wisdom 'til the similars repel\nI sell a barrel of spirit to dummy dimwit syndicate jackals\nI'm broken arrow to the fuckin' bone (broken poem)\nI don't really believe in God\nBut God, I'm scared to death of God\nI swear to God, I never meant to spill the beans\nNor tear the pod\nBut it's like...\nI hike an acre unimpressed and slept on the saber's edge\nEnough times to splice anti-Christ's favorite pledge\nI wanna know myself\nSorta solo sheep amidst wolves\nAnd still my shepherd can't administer\nThe proper push and pulls\nI push the ghouls to man overboard\nPull the bulls onto my sword\nAnd buckle down in a corner chair with a round table floor\nGot an angel on my left shoulder, a devil on the polar\nGot a mug a frigid, got a mug a solar, sliiidde over\nThe recipe's designed to plug the appetite for continuity\nBy stitching togetherness theme congruents (beautifully)\nI peel back hearts and lodge greed physics in the chambers\nCauterize the wound and heads like\n\"Gimme gimme something major\"\nRoad side prophetic, ascend well (well)\nEnveloped in a mummy ribbon system\nBlistering in a wishing well\nBIG BANG!", "title": "Big Bang", "album": "Float", "image":
