Fox\nBut no bitch, it's Danny Brown, I've got some weed up in my sock\nSo bitch get high with ya nigga\nThe sack I got is looking like some green caterpillars\nBut it smell like a skunk that's oh so defensive\nThese bitches suck my dick like it was moral incentive\nI'm off the chain like broke nunchucks\nFrom where these little niggas try to shoot you off that new Chucks\nA little dark like wet nubuck\nDecribes my state of mind is inside the tomb of King Tut\nMurders all the time is all I see\nDetroit 187 on you niggas TV\nAnd I can first agree this beat kill a nigga no charges\nFuck a female MC and a pop artist\nOh baby, I like it raw\nAnd my dick so big left stretch marks on her jaw\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm so institutionalized\nI wake up 6 a.m. because I think it's chow time\nBorderline porcupine, a step from drinking turpentine\nJust to wash down a plate of wack rappers rhymes\nI got a mind in the cosmos\nAnd if these niggas cold then I guess I'm osmosis\nThat be blowing on some potent, that these white boys be growing\nWhile you niggas smoking something smelling like a tanning lotion\nMy concoctions could make world ending potions\nThese other rap niggas got lines I got encroachments\nI get endorsements, so motherfuck your co-sign\nPunch punchlines I'll punch rappers 'til your broke spine\n'member back in '09, I told 'em it was showtime\nNow they pull they cam phones out when I go for mine\nLight camera action, Hybrid be snapping\nCause the days of no tissue had to wipe with wet napkins\nSmear up the classifieds know it sound trife\nBut to be honest a metaphor for my life\n\n[Verse 3: Chip$]\nBuzzing off the barbiturates and amphetamines\nChase it with a 40 Oz of Ready Clean\nI swear I never ever smoke the better weed\nYour bitch said I'm the swaggiest nigga she ever seen\nRun up in your crib, two K's, one mag\nYour girl get snatched like Cool J in I'm Bad\nCost to live, you ain't made enough\nGuarantee bullet holes with a laser touch\nEuropean garments drape my body if I ain't hipstered up\nIf she smile with eye contact then the bitch will fuck\nHomie gon' make me send them killers after him\nThem niggas swing swords like World Fence Champions\nYou was popping pills and drinking liquor\nNow you thinking you a gangsta killer\nI leave you stanking nigga, laid down\nFace down like you taking a planking picture\nBut I can keep the shots in the weapon\nPut the bat to back of your leg\nGrab your chin and the back of your head\nAnd twist them shits in opposite directions", "year": "2011-08-15"}], "artist": "Danny Brown"}
