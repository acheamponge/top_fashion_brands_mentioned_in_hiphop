Money, fame, and bitches\nI wanted to know, too, so I came all the way\nHere to where I am now, Polo on, come through the door\nA triumphant general, let me hear cheers of victory when I pass Dongdaemun\nAnd the drumroll and a round of applause too\nI say to myself looking at the mirror backstage\nAll of this is not a dream, I will continue to\nGo forward but first of all, great job, Well done\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\n(\"All this stuff that makes me move just feels like a dream.\")\n\n\n\n[ZICO]\nEven on the accounting day I write songs\nGo to Seocho and bother Pop Time stay tuned\nSuccess gives me a sense of duty with no time for excitement\nThe boisterous empty wagons come with empty hands and go with empty hands\nBe positive, like what Osteen quoted, the power of positivity\nThe lower consonant is wrong, it's actually the power of money\nI learned the theory of power early, the sight of you living like a machine\nIs nowhere humane, why do you keep talking about my character?\nI've cleared my family's debts, look at\nMy grandmother's house in Ilsan, my uncle's gone but\n'god save Paulus' Mom's portrait\nOn my chest, if you want to look at me properly, put the cameras down\nI make words become reality! before rebuking others\nI strive to make the impossible become true if not turn famous and rich\nThey say if passion becomes excessive, it becomes harm\nThat's right, I make you sweat and fan yourselves\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: some of the annotations are from Naver blogger '\uccad\ub958'(http://blog.naver.com/ksk98815/220274234894).)"}]}
