Watch this y'all\nIt's  Kid Capri and Jay-Z, come on!\nIt's Jay-Z and Kid Capri, don't stop, huh-huh!\n'Cause I'm like that y'all, yeah\nI'm really like that\n\n[Verse 1: Jay-Z]\nAs a young'un, dumb and gun in the waist\nSold crack to those who couldn't take the pain\nAnd had to numb it with base\nCouldn't drink the Henny straight, I needed somethin to chase\nNowadays I throw shots back, leavin' nothin' to waste\nLife's like a treadmill, niggas runnin' in place\nGettin' nowhere fast, a whole year done past\nI vowed to never stop winnin', 'til the earth stop spinnin'\nRock hot linen, cop hot cars and hot women\nIf it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not rememberin'\nMy motto is, simply \"I will not lose!\"\nAbide by the block rules, I buy my Glocks used\nWith bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?\nI'm raised, irrational, ways misunderstood\nIf you ain't live like I live, then one with the hood\nI done what I could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still\nRun with the hood, guess it's part of my nature\nIf hell awaits a, nigga I'm comin' with the razors\nStill flashin' ya shit, try to pass me in a six\nType classy on the wrist, every bit of 30 karats\nThis is, not a game this is not why I came\nMay these words find a spot on your brain and burn\nThen I recycle my life, I shall return\n\n[Chorus: Liz Leite (Jay-Z)]\nHow tight is your flow?
