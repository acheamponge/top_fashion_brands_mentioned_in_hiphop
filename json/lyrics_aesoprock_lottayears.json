{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe kid that work down at the local Baskin-Robbins\nGot a tattoo of a lipstick print attached above his collar\nI watched him relocating pistachio to a waffle\nThinking I had lost the plot if not the passion for the novel\nHe asked me what I wanted, I ordered something daft\nHe said he liked the tattoo Alex drew me of the bats\nThanks; I like it too but modestly confess\nIn present company, my coloring is not the main event\nLook at that neck\nThe message is immediate, the guy effs chicks\nI spent a lot of years making friends with cool artists\nSo when they drew me tattoos I could truly feel important\nNow some 22 year old inside a cube of brick and mortar\nGot me questioning my morals and their corny pecking order\nI should give a shit less\nCherry-No; Whip-Yes\n\n[Hook]\nLotta years\nUh, lotta years\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe girl that work down at the local juice place\nGot a head full of dreadlocks down to her waist\nI watched her add the spinach to the ginger to the grapes\nMy hair was underwhelming, my juice was fucking great\nSome lady orders Maca, compliments the locks\nShe asked how many years it took the girl to grow the crop\n\"It took a lot of years and then eventually I cut 'em, kept 'em\nReattach 'em anytime I want 'em\"\nMy mind's fucking blown\nThe future is amazing, I feel so fucking old\nI bet you clone your pets and ride a hover-board to work\nI used a folding map to find the juice place in the first\nThese kids are running wild, I'm still recovering from church\nYou should have seen me in the 90s, I could ollie up a curb\nYou should have seen me in the 80s\nI was bumping New Edition, dragging acne into Hades\n\n[Hook]\nLotta years\nNaw mean?
