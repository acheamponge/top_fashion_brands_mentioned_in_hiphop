Clap!]\n[Clap! Clap!]\n\n[Verse 2]\nUh\nTaina!\nTa-ta-Taina!\nHigh up in a canopy, sweating like a fever\nSomething about the sun in the summer\nIt got us sunning you leeches\nI got hyenas on leashes\nIt's anything for Selenas!\nAnd now they moving on my style\nSay they never trust a big bula with a smile\nSo you wanna be my papi chulo for a while\nThat's a lot of love\nBut Mami's locks longer than her now\nBig cat, Mufasa?\nChica mala, que pasa?\n[?] daddy like rasta\nNo llama, just are you [?]\nIn the gold, I'm in the glow\nSipping on little\nThey tripping on shit\nBeen the original, lived individual\nLittle indigenous digital bitch\n\n[Clap! Clap!]\n[Clap! Clap!]"}], "artist": "Nitty Scott"}
