But you know what, people be taking kindness for weakness right, I'm not trying to hear it\nThey be asking me shit, I'm not trying to hear it\nThey be trying to get put on, I'm not trying to hear it\n\n[Verse 1: Guru]\nYo I told you once, now I'm telling you twice cat\nYou know and I know, I'm nice like that\nGracefully I age, like vintage wine\nBecause I'm true to the game, and I evolve through different times\nMe and my man Paul, stimulate y'all\nHow come so many can bust shots, but got no hand skills at all\nWe didn't learn from the deaths of the great ones\nAnd niggas don't think about doing bids, until they face one\nI'm not a hater, I'm a congratulator\nPlus I'm still in the mix, trying to get my paper\nIt's just that the money can't be more important than truth\nAnd niggas have babies, but don't be thinking 'bout the youth\nThey be straight misleadin' niggas, while I be straight feedin' niggas\nAnd if I had better marketing, I'd have better sales figures\nFuck it, steal my position I'll never share it\nI'm that nigga from Gang Starr, and I'm not trying to hear it\n\n[Hook: Planet Asia & Guru]\nSo do what we do it takes experience so aim high\nWe them guys in the game who take it serious\nWe come across humble, but we still might snap\nAnd have a fit cause we not trying to hear that shit\n\nI'm not trying to hear it, I'm not trying to hear that shit\nI'm not trying to hear it, I'm not trying to hear that shit\n\n[Verse 2: Planet Asia]\nWith murderous flows, I stay on some MC next level degree shit\nWith a heart to beat, [?] annunciation\nYeah, no more shall I be fronted on\nSongs get punished, published, performed while MC's get hunted on\nAnd I don't give a fuck about who got a hundred songs\nMy stamina equipped with the banana clip, long\nAnd y'all won't be able to last on that [?] shit, long\nCause to be able to spit, you got to plan your shit strong\nI push to [?], that of a weightlifting inmate\nWaiting on the track that somebody can send me\nI'm from Cali where niggas try to be friendly, but quick to ride on they enemies\nTo honour the saga of war story trilogy's\nMy style cost more, you cats is sophomore\nI'm everywhere oversees, or offshore now who can floss more?\nFuck it, I'll say it I'm sick of these white dudes\nSo fuck [landspeeds?], (?), and the new [Wu?]\nCause if I didn't do shows, I would've been murdered one of y'all punks\nAnd probably made the front cover of [?]\nAnd when you see me in the club with my niggas, we ain't rappin' at all\nSo the next cat to run up on some battle shit, I'm slappin' 'em down\nReady for repercussions, reefer puffin'\nStreets is nothin', I'm slappin' niggas in the face just to teach 'em something\nThis is the new me, cause life is like a movie\nMurderous few, from you know who it's yours truly\nPlanet Asia Y'all\n\n[Interlude/Scratches]\nYo I told you once, now I'm telling you twice cat\nYou know and I know, I'm nice like that\nYou know and I know, I'm nice like that\nYou know and I know, I'm nice like that\n\n[Verse 3: Guru]\nConstantly I hear the same old joints, on the radio\nIt's crazy yo, I'm tired of them lame old joints\nSome songs hot but a lot, purely political\nSome rappers got energy, but need to be more lyrical\nThe game is changed though, it's about drugs and range rovers\nIf not it's about guns and expensive champagne, yo\nThey yap about whatever whip they've got\nHow many keys they flip, how many niggas they've shot\nHave you forgot? The streets have always been that ill\nHave you forgot? The god's got mad skills\nAnd niggas need to focus before our cause turns hopeless\nOr watch poverty and death, swarm our cities like locusts\nWhether it's 1992, or 2002\nI'mma rep like I'm supposed to for my peeps and for you\nAnd it's true, my position I'm not tryin' to share it\nCause I'm OG Bobby Guru, and I'm not tryin' to hear......", "year": null}]}
