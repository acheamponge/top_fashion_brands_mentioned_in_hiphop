C-Rayz, unfortunately [?].  Everybody say:\n\n[Hook: Pudge]\nI don\u2019t really be\nFeeling how and what it is you\u2019re\nSaying and the messages\nRelaying.  Once again, everybody say:\nWe don\u2019t really, really be\nFeeling how and what it is you\u2019re\nSaying and all the messages\nRelaying.

You know\nBefore we gon\u2019 get take over\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nJust like them\nCrazy ladies in the garden.  That\u2019s right\nI\u2019m talking to the seeds \u2018cause they\u2019re starving.  There\u2019s light\nWe need water.  I beg you pardon, get right\n\u2018Cause this left side\u2019ll disorder their squadron\nDeep.  Yeah, they can\u2019t save us\nThe streets is raising the Larry Davis of\nEach community\u2014Bronx borough to Staten to Manhattan\nThey keep rapping while them people keep clapping, drum-\n-tapping with the liquid fire, kissing this\nTalking the truth to the liar, talking the stoop to the\nWire, talking the Boop to the Betty to steady\nHeavy machete gets you stuck in a quagmire\n\u201cGod!\u201d  That\u2019s just Allah.
