One, two! And through and through\nThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\nHe left it dead, and with it's head\nHe went galumphing back\n\n\"And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?\nCome to my arms, my beamish boy!\nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'\nHe chortled in his joy\n\n`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;\nAll mimsy were the borogoves\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe", "title": "The Jabberwocky", "album": "A Book Of Human Language", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c348dfe824da4f3b04231c7e4d629ae.700x700x1.jpg", "year": "1998-04-14"}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
