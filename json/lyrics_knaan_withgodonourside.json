I could tie my shoe\nI was blind, but I knew, that I would always see blue\nBlue seas I see through, on the bottom I\u2019ll meet you\nAnd when we come up for a breath, would you mind if I kiss you?\n\nChildhood came up for the kiss, but its lips was painted with mist\nAnd the sunny skies came and I missed it\nVanished and windswept\nLanded and we slept in the arms of convenience, blanket obedience\n\nNow the Somali-American\nWar had its day\nAnd the Civil War too was soon laid away\nAnd the names of our warlords\nI was made to memorize\nWith guns in they hands, they say\nGod\u2019s on their side\n\nI had an undying wish to keep from dying\nI had an untimely hitch keep me from climbing\nBut I climbed the hitch itself and I tried flying;\nI had an uprising in my soul\n\nThe left was fighting the right\nAnd the right was fighting the light\nAnd the light was blind in the night\nAnd the night woke up in tears\nWhen my fingers went to wipe them\nThey became a poem but to write them\nThey would have to speak tears in another language;\nThat would take years\n\nSo now as I\u2019m leaving\nI\u2019m weary as Hell\nThe confusion I\u2019m feeling\nAin\u2019t no tongue can tell\nThe words fill my head\nAnd fall to the floor:\nIf God\u2019s on your side then\nWould you ever need war?"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
