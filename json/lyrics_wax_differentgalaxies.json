I guess that we'll see in time\n\n2nd Verse:\n\nI swig on 40 ounces she sips on champagne, she has a huge backyard I do the landscapin\n\nI get her single roses, she gets me laker tickets, call her on my prepaid phone when I can't wait to kick it\n\nWe're quite the odd couple, but who are you to judge, I know it dont make sense, you can call it stupid love\n\nBut its the whole world against us, they can try to stop us but we're going out like gangstas, I know that I'm hated by her camp\n\nBut I swear this'll end like the lady and the tramp, I'm just waiting for my chance\n\nThey keep saying that shes way too good for me, sometimes I wish sugar momma was sugar free\n\nCause I ain't in it for the dough, I ain't diggin for the gold, I just wanna show all yall what both of us been knowin\n\nI don't want any problems or any of her dollas, I just want yall to leave us alone and don't call us\n\nChorus (Sam Ock):\n\nYou and me, we are two stars from different galaxies\nWill we cross or be aligned? I guess that we'll see in time\n\nYou and me, we are two stars from different galaxies\nWill we cross or be aligned? I guess that we'll see in time\n\n(Piano Solo)\n\nBridge:\n\nIts the whole world against us, they can try to stop us but we're going out like gangstas!\n\nIts the whole world against us, they can try to stop us but we're going out like gangstas!\n\n(DJ ZO Scratches)\n\nChorus (Sam Ock):\n\nYou and me, we are two stars from different galaxies\nWill we cross or be aligned? I guess that we'll see in time\n\nYou and me, we are two stars from different galaxies\nWill we cross or be aligned?
