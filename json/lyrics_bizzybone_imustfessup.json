Roll the weed, I don't care\"\nWe'll be feelin 'em, so in love with me, and yes the feelin is mutual\nAs I ride pass the graveyard, reminiscin over the funeral\nMy brother is here in spirit, made his peace with the Lord\nYou can ask Ninja when it happened, Capo loved the Lord\nI put 'Pac on, all rap music we bumpin\nBaby lookin at me chillin, she feelin me, makin a million\nPass the cup into my girl and Brandy, I mean Britney\nKinda tipsy on the backseat in the Lincoln stretch fizzy\nI still love you boo, still true to the affection\nNever abandon this protection, the fuckin direction\nI still love you boo, still true to the affection\nNever abandon my protection, the focus in yo' direction; what\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bizzy Bone]\nWe at the road, still chillin, watchin movies and we smokin\nBaby she lookin so beautiful, \"You comfortable?\" \"Boo, you know it\"\nWas the answer that she gave me as we finished the spinach\nCause dinner at Ruth Chris, let's get drunk for the reel spinnin\nFi-let mig-non, big lobster, champagne was Dom\nWe need some Cristal, won't get it for now, let's get it on\nAnd we kissin at the table as the patrons sip Patron\nOne patron told us go get a room, and go home\n500 dollars on the table, we half-naked\nMakin out, tearin our clothes off, the limo get to shakin\nBetter save it for the room, I can't wait no more\nWith the slow jam of \"Secret Lovers\" playin at the door\nThe star shinin so bright, they watchin from afar\nYou're a shinin star, forever and ever you are\nWe at the corner, I guess it's just like Ike and Tina\nClothes messed up, bra on backwards, I gotta see her, gotta see her\n\n[Chorus]"}], "artist": "Bizzy Bone"}
