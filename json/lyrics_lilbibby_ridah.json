Let me know\nI'm out of town in the stu'\nStill trappin', fuck nigga just called broke\nLet's make it happen, callin' plays, young Madden\nMost wanted, Bin Laden\nYoung niggas come through\nTry to run, red dot, real master\nGot foreign cars, foreign clothes, foreign hoes\nExtended clips, foreign poles\nReal shit, real hittas, doin' hits\nMurk niggas, never told\nGot a 50 shot Glock .40 with a drum\nHop out, nigga run\nNiggas know where I stay\nI ain't worried about shit, let 'em come\nGot Mac-10s, ARs, AKs, FNs, my best friend\nI keep a gun, sleep with guns\nDumb nigga, try your luck, step in\nFully auto, double trigger, tappin' ones\nHollow tips catch ten\n\n[Hook]\nIt's my ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)\nMy ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)\nMy ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)\nMy ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)\nMy ambitions as a rider, don't get fired up (don't get fired up)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI pull up with Lil G, and G Slim, and Lil Squeak\nSlide down on Lamron, Lil Reese throwin' up two threes\nYoung boss with the two T's\nI stay countin' that blue cheese\nNiggas said they gon' do me\nSo I ride around with a few heats\nBeen paranoid for like two weeks\nIn the van with that .223\nSpent 30k on my neck bitch\nTry to rob me? Gotta shoot me\nDon't fuck around with no rap niggas\nI post up with them crack dealers\nYoung niggas that jack niggas\nAnd ride around and whack niggas\nStill bumpin' that Illmatic in traffic\nGlock-20 that's still in plastic\nThick bitch, she real rachet\nI'mma still smash it\nGot all eyes on me\nNiggas act like they know me\nBibby, I'm a young OG\nI don't fuck with no police\nNo we don't play them games nigga\nWe don't fuck with no lames nigga\nSit your five dollar ass down before I make change nigga\nYou lookin' just like a stain nigga\n\n[Hook]\nIt's my ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)\nMy ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)\nMy ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)\nMy ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)\nMy ambitions as a rider, don't get fired up (don't get fired up)"}], "artist": "Lil Bibby"}
