You feel good??\n\n[Hook 2x]\n\n[K'Naan speaking to end]\nWe not down and out...just because the times are hard\nUh-uh...uh-uh...yeah...shout out to the strugglers\nIn my country...the hardest place on Earth right now\nBut still...I still know how to get down\nI still know how to vibe out\nStill know how to talk to a pretty girl\nTake it easy now...YEAH"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
