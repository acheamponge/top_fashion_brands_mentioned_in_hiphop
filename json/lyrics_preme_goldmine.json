Reign]\nAh, rolling swishers, scrolling naked pictures\nCar service cracked a windows catch 'em blowing kisses\nNiggas drowning, we don't feed the fishes\nGrilling when they see P like they hate the Clippers\nI'm never going back to jail ain't got no bigger wishes\nStill not gon' walk like i'm superstitious\nMercedes Brabus, 850, the new addition\nAnd the wheel still spinning like its new edition\nBorrowed a quarter, paid it back in a year\nSit your ass in the rear, I see a king in the mirror\nCrown lean to the side, from where the villains reside\nSuck my teeth in the street, then learned to swallow my pride\nI ain\u2019t right at the top, but I\u2019m right on the rise\nI've see titans collide, I was fucking inspired\nIn the hoods trying to be good, get out or die\nJust went and blew a mil for a crib in the sky that's way up\n\n[Hook]\nI'm trying to make a 100 grand\nAnd do it 10 more times\nI can double up in no time\nYou ain't got a couple Benz you can roll my\nI'm trying to make a 100 grand\nAnd do it 10 more times\nAnd fuck a nigga co-sign\nImma get it on my own, all my gold mine\n\n[Verse 2: P. Reign]\nBought a Benzes to whip it, bought a hoe to kick it\nBought a stripper to tip it, and did it all with my niggas\nDid it all for the city, with my town on my fitted\nYou got a Civic that's kitted, talkin' you ballin\u2013pathetic\nMy nigga what are we talking\nIf it ain't about winnin'\nIf it ain't about women, 38 in my [linen]\nLord I've been mobbin forgive me\nI prayed this semi protect me\nWent to church for confession\nAnd blamed it all on a Henny\nI was homeless, gorilla mode, beat my chest\nYou on the menu time to meet the chef\nCan\u2019t stop to celebrate, there's more to make\nSmoking loud, my niggas smell like a noise complaint\nHigher pier, like a bright idea\nFuck them nosey hoes prefer to keep my sinus clear\nSelling pies, I\u2019m a pioneer\nBring your budget, I got you covered like riot gear, yeah\n\n[Hook]\nI'm trying to make a 100 grand\nAnd do it 10 more times\nI can double up in no time\nYou ain't got a couple Benz you can roll my\nI'm trying to make a 100 grand\nAnd do it 10 more times\nAnd fuck a nigga co-sign\nImma get it on my own, all my gold mine\n\n[Outro: Daniel Daley]\nI'm trying to make a 100 grand\nAnd do it 10 more times\nI can double up in no time\nYou ain't got a couple Benz you can roll my\nFuck a nigga co-sign\nAll my gold mine, gold mine\nYou ain't got a couple Benz you can roll my\nAll my gold mine, gold mine\nFuck a nigga co-sign\nAll my gold mine", "year": "2015-12-03"}]}
