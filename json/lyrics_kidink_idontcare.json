I'm allergic to the fake\nNever ever gave a fuck, they used to say it was a phase\nBut I'm still riding round with my middle finger up\nTop down on a gown, put them titties in the air\nSee them looking at me now like that nigga got a nerve\nI ain't worried, keep tipping, watch them all turn round\nAnd bust down to the ground\nI've been bustin my balls tryna put on for my town\nNever put in the towel, put that vow on my vouch\nFuck the judgement and trial, don't nobody make a sound\n\n[Hook: Maejor Ali & Kid Ink, Kid Ink]\nI don't really care what everybody got to say\nI hear them talking but they ain't saying nothing, no\nI don't really care what everybody gotta say\nFirst they love then they hate, it be changing every day\nSo don't believe what they tell you\nDon't believe what they say\nDon't believe what they tell you\nDon't believe, don't believe what they say\n\n[Bridge: Maejor Ali]\nYou know, sometimes in life, you just gotta go for it\nYou can't listen to what the next person saying how they feel\nYou listening?\n\n[Outro: Maejor Ali]\nI don't really care what everybody gotta say (oh no I don't)\nI don't really care what everybody gotta say (oh no I don't, no I don't)"}]}
