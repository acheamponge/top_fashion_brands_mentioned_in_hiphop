You should see them\nBurn an L 'cause it's crazy in here\nCrazy in here, crazy in here\nI feel free, I feel freedom\nWhy they mad? You should see them\nBurn an L 'cause it's crazy in here\nCrazy in here, crazy in here\n\n[Verse 2]\nWho I wanna work with? Nobody! 99% of them is nobody\nBitches acting like they killing shit, OK\nWhen I check these bitches guns, no bodies\nThese niggas is fake fucks and opportunists\nNiggas spend they last dime to say the copped the soonest\nWhy these niggas going broke to get your approval?\nPretty soon, they'll be back up on them Ramen Noodles\nB-B-B-bible, Queen is the title\nAnd if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal\nAnd if you in the club, then it's a Young Money recital\nI'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle\nI'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin' idol\nPink Friday in Macy's, thongs and some pasties\n(Yo, what other female rapper perfume in here? 'Cause I must've missed it)\n12 milli to kick my feet up, get ready this is the Re-up\n\n[Chorus]\nI feel free, I feel freedom\nWhy they mad? You should see them\nBurn an L 'cause it's crazy in here\nCrazy in here, crazy in here\nI feel free, I feel freedom\nWhy they mad? You should see them\nBurn an L 'cause it's crazy in here\nCrazy in here, crazy in here\n\n[Bridge]\nMirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide\nWhat you hiding from? What you hiding from?\nMirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide\nWhat you hiding from? What you hiding from?\nHiding, baby\nWould you, would you, give your\nWould you, would you, give your\nWould you, would you, give your all for yours?\nWould you, would you, give your\nWould you, would you, give your\nWould you, would you, give your all for yours?\n\n[Chorus]\nI feel free, I feel freedom\nWhy they mad? You should see them\nBurn an L 'cause it's crazy in here\nCrazy in here, crazy in here\nI feel free, I feel freedom\nWhy they mad? You should see them\nBurn an L 'cause it's crazy in here\nCrazy in here, crazy in here\nIt's crazy in here"}], "artist": "Nicki Minaj"}
