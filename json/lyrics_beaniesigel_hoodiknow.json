go\nThey throw metal in every hood I know\nBut not like the one I know\n\n(Oschino)\nWe all started innocent\nEating Reese's Pieces\nI was young, then wearing 5 star Aleses\nBullet in ya gut a have a bag catch ya feces\n20 months, vision quest, sleeping in a tepee\nSince my dad died, attitude worsened\nThat's why I stole cars before I could write cursive\nThousand miles from being rich, stuck on my grind\nTry to sale nickel bags like Louie Baton\nI'm young, I'm good, best shape of my life\nOne shot from big shit a blow you out of ya Nikes\nOnly a dick head wouldn't wanna be rich\nAnd do his car like school and drop out in the 6\nYou could look at my wrist, It wasn't shit on it\nBut I was determined to get a little gliss on em\nThe 40 ounce bottles done turned to Cris on em\nAnd every bitch that was fronting, I'ma piss on em\n\n[Beanie Sigel]\nMy hood dog\nLike any average one\nYou know the dirty kids on the block having fun\nHand to hand is how the grams is slung\nIn tanned Timberlands and (?) until them vans a come\nIt's all good now\nBut you remember those latter days\nThem tubleware, soul food platter days\nThat was ya mom little hustle on a Saturdays\nBack then, when it really didn't matter days\nYou would take that beating\nCause you wasn't trying to be\nThe only one who missed the house party on the weekend\nKnowing that them project chicks was in there freaking\nGrinding off \"As We Lay\"\nWalk with me yall\nBack in the Day, you and ya man slap tapping away\nPitching chains, playing craps everyday\nGetting high on the block\nGreen bottles of private stock\n2 dollar 40's\nSparks tell ya story\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Sparks]\nI come up fragile and timid\nPressed to the limit\n12 years old, no household\nFrom the start I was finished\nDisowned by the biologicals\nAnd adopted by rolling stones on corners, sipping Thunderbird\nBanging needles and pushing stolen Regals\nAnd with no hoe and no money, layered my hunger pains daily with rice and gravy\nStuck between a rock and a hard spot as a juvenile\nJust made me wanna holla \"Lord help me\"\nBut I had will power\nStole a burner from Uncle Lester\nAnd that .22 long blossomed to wild flower\nNow when I enter rooms the conversation stop\nAnd them cock suckers whisper\nThese faggots ain't got no cahunas\nSo if they so much as touch me\nI cock back and put like bananas on them mokey motherfuckers\nShow no love for these cock suckers\nWeeping\nWho can't deal with life situations cause that's money to me\nUhh\nMurder\n\n[Freeway]\nNow who am I\nLittle nigga named Free from the hood\nWhat I do\nMake a living, make a killing in the hood\nWhat I'm trying to do now\nGet my children out the hood\nBefore the ATF start coming\nPlot, plot on\nNow who am I\nLittle nigga named Free from the block\nWhat I do\nMake a living , make a killing on the block\nWhat I'm trying to do now\nGet my children off the block\nAnd my real niggas, if they coming, clique come on\nIn my hood, F-R-double uh\nCock back, double pump\nYou rapping, I just happen to have some space in the trunk\n89' dough, space in the front\nWill ya hoe fit?\nBeef come, we be dumping the whole clip\nHaving lunch, while you be fronting, be fucking ya hoe sick\nSend her home, can't hump\nSend my nigga's through ya block, can't pump\nGrind, watch for the cops\nShit tucked\nI'll be watching them lady CO's if I slip up\nUh Uh\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI know it's hard in every hood I know\nStruggle in every ghetto I know\nBut not like the one I know\nI see the law in every hood I go\nThey throw metal in every hood I know\nBut not like the one I know\nI know it's coke in every hood I know\nIt's no joke in every hood I know\nBut not like the one I know\nI know it's rough in every hood I know\nIt's fucked up in every hood I know\nBut not like the one I know\n\n[Chris and Sigel talking]\nYo, I'm saying Mac, I know I'm young and all\n(Yeah that's whats up?)\nBut I been through a little struggle too\n(What you been through?)\nLot of crazy shit dog, ya know?\n(Shit Don't tell me, you got opportunity to tell the world)\nFeel this dog\n(Speak ya story, Yung Gun)\n\n[Chris]\nYo I was brought up in the wildest streets\nWhere niggas pack everyday, and everybody crowd to eat\n24/7, no time to sleep\nA g and up, reing up, 3 times a week\nThrowing numbers on the strip\nThe yungin out the clique\nMoves like Carl Lewis when it's coming out the clip\nUh, Still in school, all the learning I can get\nFocused, trying to purchase all the burners I can get\nI know plenty niggas fell, trying to chauffer through this shit\nThese niggas tell, then a murder gon exist\nIt's no joke in the hood\nEspecially when the boat ain't make it across\nAnd we ain't got no coke in the hood\nThat's where rap come in at, more notes in a book\nDro in the woods, Mom dukes trying to lay low in the woods\n(raps to fade)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/84576893bd0396cc4153bf1c32207302.400x400x1.jpg", "year": null, "title":
