Diddy\nGot a problem, got a piece that'll free cities (badd)\nIf you ain't starve with me you don't eat with me\nNiggas always buggin' only real niggas leave with me, ugh\nOn the mob it's a job, once a rot now i'm hot\nI'm on top, boy i'm wet, where the mop? You a knock\nKnock-knock door locked\nBitch you ain't coming in if a girl coming out it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge: Milla]\nHello, hello, hello\nWhere you at?\nHow you on it if your name ain't in it?\nHow you winning if your game ain't in it?\nSend a message with your name straight in it\nCause a message ain't a message if Sage ain't in it\n\n[Verse 2: Sage]\nI'm with my brother Smoovy looking like a movie\nCouple dimes tryna' do me and they don't know me (badd)\nThey listen to my tunes and they go loony\nStart going ape-shit like they stole a zoo key\nOn the mob it's a job, once a rot now i'm hot\nI'm on top, boy i'm wet, where the mop? You a knock\nKnock-knock door locked\nBitch you ain't coming in if a girl coming out it\n\n[Hook]", "album": null}], "artist": "Sage The Gemini"}
