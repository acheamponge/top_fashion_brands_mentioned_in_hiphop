{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Sample]\nThis is my friend Tony\nHe's pretty cool, although he's not always so smart\n\n[Intro]\nAnd then they were eight\nJust like that, just like that...\n(Bring back Pluto, back-back Pluto)\n(Back-back Pluto, Plu-Plu-Pluto)\n\n[Verse 1]\nIn the beginning it was Large Marge sent me, I'm bent\nEmpty the rent if you can double park the garbage barge gently\nThe moon took a second mortgage on the seventh house\nAnd Jupiter ain't talk to Mars, he felt the host of rovers sold him out\nClose your mouth, poke your snout over the cloaked aroma clouds\nSolar boy elope with couch ogling older Polaroids\nMotor mouth, chauffeur the golden molar toy\nGophers yoke a fish out of water, he grows lungs and multiplies\nIdle when soldering a perfect union\nIt is vital to calculate any ornery loose ends\nSo if mutiny ensues the aloof is assumed nuisance\nThe clue is in his vacancy, the proof is in his goosebumps\nMaroon the traitors expecting acres of edelweiss\nWho later learn it may actually be safer to play with knives\nI show up late looking project grizzly\nTwo bowies, a third for throwing and accomplish dickweed\nNothing, nada, nill, I stuff a lot of pill to gut\nWhat's the proper rules on stuffing hostages in trucks?\nI'll be numb enough to chill before the choppers spill the blood\nBut if I'm not!\nFuck it, plug him, warpy got his goddamned groove back\nJet-setting on spec with a dead yeti on the roof rack\nAnd miscreants will rubberneck jalopy euthanasia\nWhich will later be regretted when it's your turn for cremation\nAnd I walk like early man, freak a little witch hunt\nGathering the carnies and exploiting every stigma\nThe malformed oddities among sovereignty's normal\nShall abuse every vice you can imagine right before you\n\n[Hook]\nAll I thought of was the cloven-hooved\nAnd how they clip-clip-clop over the woven roofs\nWith a nose for commotion and stolen goods\nNow tell me, what the fuck am I supposed to do?\nIn the mean time (nine) minus (one) left (eight)\nIn the mean time (nine) minus (one) left (eight)\nIn the mean time (nine) minus (one) left (eight)\nWe were busy putting barbs on a large iron gate\n\n[Interlude]\n(Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune)\n(Bring back Pluto, back-back Pluto)\n(Back-back Pluto, Plu-Plu-Pluto)\nThey're all-they're gonna want his milk money next\n\n[Verse 2]\nStare into the glowing eye of Cerberus and crow\nAuthoritative laminates will not repel the quarantined alone\nAll the town sickly know the Coke machine as home\nWhere they sit and hope the Ovaltine that noble's drink is strong\nCouples only roller rink with soul to kiss your chicken noodle\nBefore they wiggle mittens through the pillory to ridicule\nAnd you can hear the iron maidens lock\nOr see the town criers ankle stock chained up to the tanker truck\nA is up early, ring and run thank you much\nDocument a little of that underbelly bang for buck\nHey I walk as the hype of the city gossip\nMeaning every dumpster diver's gotta vomit up a comment like\nUm you ain't shit, this ain't ill\nThis is little Russian dolls that get smaller and smaller still\nThis a corpse full of pills trying to sit still and build\nCause eight planets bullied number nine until he fell\nBabylon goggles, gawk for the galvatron coppers\nTugboat salvage all fossils\nI'll be shepherd when the whirlybirds deny the lepers doctors\nIf I'm not, fuck it\nThe terrible metal hacking seasons's as American as ski up off a plastic d-cup\nYou'd think Charlie Brown was Weathermen\nHow I zig-zag around these yellow backs for peanuts\nIn the baggy stomach lining attached to the bums in hiding sits the morals\nEvery outing would slide to refine his grinding\nWhen the freakishly disfigured have been triggered to surround you\nYou will live inside the actual second they let the hounds loose\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\n(Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune)\n(Bring back Pluto, back, back, back)\n(Pluto-Pluto, bring back Pluto)\n(Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune)\n(Bring back Pluto, back-back Pluto)\n(Back-back Pluto, Plu-Plu-Pluto)", "title": "Bring Back Pluto", "album": "None Shall Pass", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3d6c4d11084714cc67f880d71310d197.288x288x1.jpg", "year": "2007-08-28"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
