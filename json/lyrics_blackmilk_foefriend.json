Homie that was the Muscle\nThought he could do it better\nBrother\u2019s keeper? Nah, friendship already severed\nDown to do whatever to get the crown\nBoss had a feeling but was like\n\u201cNah, my man\u2019s holding me down\u201d\nUntil he found himself at a red light, blinded by headlights\nBest friend takes other friend\u2019s life\n\n[Chorus]\nI hope you become everything you wanted to be\nI hope you seeing anything you wanted to see\nYeah, do anything for some paper\nIt\u2019s what they say, guess it\u2019s human nature, It\u2019s like\nI hope you become everything you wanted to be\nI hope you seeing anything you wanted to see\nYeah, do anything for some paper\nIt\u2019s what they say, guess it\u2019s human nature, It\u2019s like\n\n[Verse 2]\nTwo homegirls, since twelfth grade remained cool\nMade sure they was accepted into the same school\nGrew up fast, every dude tryna holla\nEvery dude in class, knew both wouldn\u2019t bother if\nYour dollars didn\u2019t add up to a lot of \u2018em\nGold chains the aim, if you had the lot of 'em\nProbably caught the eyes of both\nUntil it turned into only one girl catching eyes from most (Why?)\nOne friend started living a little more lavish\nThe other friend started feeling a little more savage\nWish she had the same to the point she start flirtin\u2019\nWith her friend\u2019s man, snuck in like a serpent\nHook, line, and sinker, set a trap now wait\nMan being a man, watch him fall for the bait\nThe former came knockin', dressed in all black\nDude dipped, now she tryna get her best friend back\n\n[Chorus]\nI hope you become everything you wanted to be\nI hope you seeing anything you wanted to see\nYeah, do anything for some paper\nIt\u2019s what they say, guess it\u2019s human nature, It\u2019s like\nI hope you become everything you wanted to be\nI hope you seeing anything you wanted to see\nYeah, do anything for some paper\nIt\u2019s what they say, guess it\u2019s human nature"}], "artist": "Black Milk"}
