And his life is seeming so infinite\nThey call him a demon when he steadily feedin' the need'n be keepin' it limitless\nI was back in the days when the rappin' amazed\nEverybody wanna rap at the waves\nA lot of the rappers up from the passin' away\nBut I was there and nigga, I'm still here, the killa that been feared\nFor livin' in them years and leavin' 'em in tears\nHella fast when he say, the lyrical lash and with a passion he spray\nAlucard in your dreams, everlasting life ain't hard as it seems\nPart of the thing, rapper eatin' rappers up\nIf you step you gon' start a machine\nLosing so many lives, all alone in the skies\nI've been livin' so long and this music was still goin' through it\nSeen so many die\n\n[Hook] (2X)\nAlucard everlasting, timeless bars when I'm rapping\nAll these stars never last yet I will still stand while everyone's passing\n\n[Verse 2]\nBeen around for the rise and fall of many, it's plenty of y'all\nThey was in the game heavy involved, now you ain't livin' at all\nA lot of these people looked dead at me, then I knew it would be the heridity\nNever credited me now they wanna know the secret to my longevity\nI think it's in my blood, my scent begins to flood\nEverybody on the planet understand it, I give them a drug\nAnd I get no rest time until it's set shines\nI say it's Alucard, you call it Tech N9ne!\nBy now you know I'm more than just a rapper\nI will be now and yes I will be after\nI am older than fucking ghetto blasters\nBut they wonder why youngsters love me, label me master\nI am faster than all of you bastards\nLivin' at the bottom, I got up and then\nI brought 'em a bullet from a gun, I'mma long laster\nNow you ask for explanation, my last word\nA-L-U-C-A-R-D, read it backwards\n\n[Hook] (2X)\n\n[Outro]\nAlucard everlasting\nStill frying while watching their demise\nYet, I am not, the only one, of my kind\nIce Cube is one of us\nSnoop Dogg is one of us\nBusta Bus' is one of us\nNasty Nas is one of us\n40 water (E-40), one of us\nScarface, one of us\nJay-Z, one of us\nDr. Dre, one of us\nOutKast, one of us\nUncle Luke, one of us"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
