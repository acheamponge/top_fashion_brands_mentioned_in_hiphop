What's the rage across the planets?\nMy words, the blunts for ya ear's canvass\nThe crayon for your mind's colouring pamphlet\nPriest-anthics my thesis, I build it like Egypt\nAbility increases, my mic possess the soul of all living creatures\nCrawling out the black waters\nFalling from the furthest of the orbits, his name is Walter\nAmongst the New Yorkers and slick talkers\nTo the followers of underworld crime, to the gangsters regions of mind\nThat wears a heart of caves for legions inside\nTo the shooters that decrease the future\nThis not the same old street shit that your used to\nI'm here to bring Heaven and Earth, put the Devil back in the dirt\nPull up Leviathan's skirt capture the first slave master\nMake the US tanks reverse, I'm too fast for y'all kids\nEvery time I blink I read new data on the back of my eyelids\nIt's Priest the 5th kingdom\nEvery second a dynasty rise in my mind, I spit so you can see them\nA throne on my tongue that sits a king for telling what to come\nA thousand years of blackness for rappers who don't practice\nMy rap lift like the mother hover craft\nI kill four hundred emcees, call me The Number Man\nUnderstand I'm talking to you like Uncle Sam\nIt's the Son of Man, I talk with the mouth of Jesus\nMy brain cell produces ether, that pours from my skin like juice\nOn the stoop with pharaoh features in the 'Psychic World of Walter Reed'\nI'm talking in 3D, it's bought as a CD\nAnd I'm giving one away free, so what you like?"}]}
