Is someone there?\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nI covered every base and solved that dirt from mystery\nIf don\u2019t know you in my present I can\u2019t recall you from my history\nDistantly awake, violently shake near narcissism\nYou get away as fast as you can, it\u2019s where the art isn\u2019t\nKinda like a front group for a flock of casualties\nThe God they got for sale is in your wallet already actually\nGreen pictures of white men don\u2019t answer prayers\nBut turn odds, I\u2019m just a stacking Christ\u2019s dads hope to burn God\n\n[Hook]\n\nHello? Is someone there?\nOf course you see me, there\u2019s cameras everywhere\nYou know? We\u2019re just like the press\nA bunch of reporters and liars spying on each other\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nI think of the past and how the future isn\u2019t how I imagined it\nBut the past is exactly right where I unraveled it\nExcuses for failed attempts, gained another one I used a noose\nIt\u2019s not until you fall apart you see the screws are loose\nAnd the screwdriver\u2019s in the hands of the girl you live with\nAnd show affection when those you love are agents of deception\nFaces come and go, the lies disguised as purity\nIt tastes better than the reality, rotting in obscurity\n\n[Hook]\n\nHello? I know you\u2019re there\nIf you\u2019ve come to get me you can wait with despair\nYou know? There\u2019s not much left\nBut you\u2019re welcome to help yourself along with all the rest"}]}
