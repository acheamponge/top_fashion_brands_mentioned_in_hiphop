Pray the Lord forgive me\nPray He guides me by for what I'm 'bout to go through, pray\n\n[Break: Beyonc\u00e9]\nDeliver me in thy righteousness\nAnd cause me to escape\nAnd climb thine air unto me\nSave me thine Lord (pray for me!)\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nGeah.. anywhere there's oppression\nAnd the drug profession\nFlourishes like beverages, refreshing (ahhh!)\nSweet taste of sin\nEverything I seen made me everything I am\nBad drug dealer or victim, I beg\nWhat came first? Moving chickens or the egg?\nThis is why I be so fresh\nI'm trying to beat life 'cause I can't cheat death\nTreat shame with shamelessness\nAim stainlesses at anuses, you know the game this is?\nMove coke like Pepsi\nDon't matter what the brand name is\nI stand behind mine\nEverything I do, I'm a man behind mine\nI'm not an angel, I'm sure, but every night before I lay\nI drop my knees to the floor and I pray\n\n[Outro: Beyonc\u00e9]\nThe name shall endure forever\nThe name shall be continued as long as the sun (pray for me!)\nMen shall be blessed in Him\nAll nations shall call Him blessed\nIn your name I pray... (pray for me!)\nLord bless us", "title": "Pray", "image": "https://images.genius.com/778c1892b8a2f5aee554c4c797ca8915.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2007-11-06", "album": "American Gangster"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
