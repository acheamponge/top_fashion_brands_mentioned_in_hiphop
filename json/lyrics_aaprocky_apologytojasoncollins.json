I didn\u2019t really notice it until I got home and saw it. I apologize to Jason for that, because people was laughing and shit, and you know\u2026 I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s funny. I saw they were making all the memes and pictures and making fun of him. There\u2019s people out there that think I was doing that to be funny, and truthfully I got gay people in my family. I don\u2019t give a fuck if you gay or you not, I just found it odd that MTV wanted to stand me next to this nigga when they are talking about gay people, that\u2019s all. You know what I\u2019m saying?", "year": null}]}
