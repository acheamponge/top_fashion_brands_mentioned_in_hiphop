is power always\nListen\n\nOi, Mate my personal life's great\nSome of you would love me more, If I rubbed that in you're face\nOkay, well\nLet us run down the resume and have a little chat about how Akalas living today\nBig whip, nice yard, Been all over the globe\nLook how many continents I have done, Shows\nCouple little company's, Neat little office\nEverything going swell, Little bit of profit\nBuilt a business educating kids from the blocks\nSo far as I'm concerned you gotta be a mug to not rate him\nOwn my own masters, Still my own master\nNovels and scripts on the way\nRap is just a part of, The genius and it's said\nAnd he knows it, Dickhead, Since I used to kick ball for West ham\nWith my bighead\nBack in school days wearing hand-me downs from my sister\nAnd gal' was still onto man, Now thats some ras charisma\nAs just a nippa, I took my first pull of rizla\nAnd who you think gave me that? yeah my bigger sista\nSo when we speak of struggle cousin it's yours\nYou know the same old madness, working class poor\nYeah, So, may of won a couple awards\nBut I guarantee my family's just as messed up as yours\nAll the abuse and the alcoholism and drug addiction\nUncles going to prison\nThis is working class livin' in Britain, It ain't great\nYou gotta be kiddin'\nSo please don't ever get confused by me spittin'\nCos', yes I said the ghetto's in our head\nBut no I didn't mean that if you live next to a food yard that thats in your dreams\nI meant believing in the madness they spout about us\nIt's far more dangerous than putting us in council houses\nSo yeah I criticize but from a place of love, never, ever\nBecause I think that I've become above\nEvery young broth, you wanna judge as a tug'\nIt's me minus a little guidance and love\nSo I think that your the mug\nAnd why be smug when it's an actual fact\nWe all commit crime, Simply by paying tax\nCos' we then go and tickle the people in Iraq\nAnd ask them so politely for all their minerals we extract\nWe blew children's heads off, Set fire to backs\nWere a gangsta nation get down or you get clapped, so\nWhen you see the yout' running around on the road with heaters\nDon't be surprised, they're just copying their leaders\nLong as the wars stay in places that are brown and poor\nWe can all pretend to be abhorred but we applaud\nIf you go up to Knightsbridge and get violent\nThe police man who duppies you will probably get knighted\nIf I don't wanna fight you cuz'\nIt ain't cos' I'm frightened\nIt's just rather fight with those who really think they're titans, shit\nI ain't scared of bleeding\nI ain't scared of breathing another breath in this world where everything is so uneven\nWhere millions murdered in the Congo and it's barely news\nBut if a footballers wife should buy a pair of shoes\nI'm supposed to give a fuck apparently, I do not\nThe worlds a reflection of you're block\nAnd if you think a world that profit from their death, and be totally cool\nAnd things should be better cos' you live here, your a bloody fool\nLook around the genocidal abuse\nI swear humanity ain't nothing but a virus with shoes\nThen I pick my nephew up from school, and I look at the youths\nAnd see the love that they show each other and I'm just so confused\nBecause they ain't learnt yet what is their race or religion\nSo we're put unconditioned but we learn to play our position\nIn the system\nLook what that does to our recognition of self\nWe grow suspicion of our own intuition, listen\nAkalas sick but he raps about racism to much\nCould you imagine I gave a flying f\nCos' it's amazing, how many wanna claim they love this music\nWith no respect for the actual struggle that produced it\nDid Hip-Hop not start in segregated hoods, are them hoods not still segregated?\nSo it's really good\nAnd the first nation not still on reservations where the age of 46\nIs the average life expectation\nAnd fellas, I wonder where the Favelas, could be suddenly knocked down\nAnd replaced with something better\nIf you got sense you see fights are joined in race class and\nGender are sides of the same coin\nSo, if you really down for justice whoever the people who suffered, whoever you are\nI consider you my sisters, brothers\nBut call it what it is like Carlin or Bill Hicks\nNot these patronizing left-wing little twits who ask me dumb shit\nOn the superior tip\nAnd wanna act like cos I read I saw less violence as a kid\nDon't make me an exception\nFor your mental protection\nFrom acceptin' the madness in the system we are left in\nThat was the clearest thing to come of august events\nAll the closet bigots started speaking their minds again\nSo when a Jamaican or Asians misbehavin' of course it's because of their skin\nBlonde hair kills a million people, thats just him\nAnd it's entertaining some people are so thick\nBut I prefer that to all of the fake grins\nCos' it's the only problem people claim they wanna so but don't actually wanna talk about\nHow it evolved, You are told, this country really really yours sir?\nWhat they did to brown people they did to their own poor first\nAnd originally in the states, working class whites were also enslaved\nStill no one talks about it today\nEver since the master came with the system of privileged\nMade the working whites the overseers mulatto the house\nCos' put the darkest blacks in the field, that mind is with us still\nBillion dollar industry's, skin cream and bleaching pills\nAnd lets be honest most people of my complexion to this very day still think they're\nBetter than the darker section\nYou say it's changed then only educate me about Wilberforce not about the Africans in Haiti\nWho beat the army's of the British, Spanish and napoleon, From the moment it was stolen\nFrom em, There was no controllin' em\nWhen I was in school, she said no you never fought for freedom\nNo, we freed you and you were on your knees pleading\nAnd once more did you know that we kind of saved you from the barbarism of Africa\nYou should be grateful\nAnd enough of our own people can't be bothered to read\nThat they actually believe that we were swinging from trees\nThey don't know the kingdom of Congo had embassy's in Italy\n500 years ago, Literally\nAin't heard of Saint Maurice or Septimius Severus\nThey ain't studying the past cos' they think it's irrelevant\nAnd attempts of pretending ancient Egyptians weren't African\nNuttin' more than pseudo intellectual lies\nThey obviously ain't read what Aristotle, Herodotus said\nAbout people they saw for their own eyes and\nEgypt's been invaded since the fall of the pharaoh's\nNot once, Not twice, But many many times\nAnd nobody wants to explain why so many statues have missin' noses\nEven when those statues made of granite\nIt ain't one people alone, mis-taught about themselves\nWe live on Celtic land, But don't learn about the Celts\nThe same, Irish people you characterize as stupid\nDuring the dark ages some of the most educated living in Europe\nAnd did you learn the numbers you count with every day\nWere invented by Indian people, I bet you didn't\nOr how many million Indians fought for Britain in both world wars\nStill you got the cheek to call them immigrants\nWe don't learn about the Moors of course, for some that knowledge dangerous\nIs it a problem the impact they had on the Renaissance\nWhen people take power over another group\nWe minimize their achievements so we can make it feel true\nSo if you think Columbus was first to sail ocean blue\nYou probably believe Elvis created rock&roll too\nAnd oh, for the record no doubt I believe in peace\nBut not for one second will I turn the other cheek\nThey slap you, slap them back and take teeth\nThe only way a bully ever learn is getting beat\nFight, fire with fire nah fire with water\nSee the life you enforce is stronger than the destroyer\nThat's why these MC's can't speak to me\nNO, All men are not made equally\nMy brains made of iron fiber, conductin' the livest wire\nMy average grades higher than Oxford and Cambridge require\nI don't want credit, because I got a message\nI want credit cos' I'm the best MC\nDead it\nWhen I came out way back in 04\nSister had just won every award\nMost man would have done the bait thing\nPut big sis on the chorus chords\nThat would of been a-list or\nQuickly I would of been famous more\nBut look how I came in this ting' raw\nBang of the streets and more\nIf I MC'd and I heard me rap i'd be like what the\nI ain't never gonna' be that good so\nI better not push my luck\nIt will embarrass me\nOnly insanity, Would make you challenge me\nBetter hope if we bump heads, that day that I fee like charity\nIf not it's a beaten and ain't no use in searching for meaning\nCuz all it means is that you are crap and I am a genius\nWait I'm Panama I'll push the parameter\nCan you imagine a Pharaoh more sicker than average\nI'll kill them with character\nBenjamin Banneker\nLook at the marriage of stamina\nDamage ya\nBoy from Britannica\nGot love from the whole in the calendar, so cold that I roll in a Challenger\nWhy your men roll with the ametures\nIm too much harder\nYou can just call him Father Akala\nBut I don't talk shit like a pastor\nMany know that I'm smarter than Arthur\nBloody disaster\nFire astarter\nProbably prodigy\nMake you a martyr\nFor these crap MC's that mumble\nThen see me in the flesh and crumble\nNever told you that I was humble\nNo I'm not, Don't lie\nI'm so sure with my writing ability\nThat I feel like I'm finding divinity\nSit down and rhyme soliloquy\nMy agility, timing is Military\nWhat scene? get a Guillotine for the Mini-me\nIt seems ya'll fiend for the the mimicry\nYour team couldn't dream of this synygy\nThat I be when I scheme on a wicked beat\nThere he goes again with the big words, with bare syllables\nGet your dictionaries out\nThat's what I'm about\nClowns wanna shout\nThrash him, smash him in the mouth\nBloody professor\nMan of the letter\nI've read and I've read and I'm sure that I'm better\nNever regretting the endeavor to dead an oppressor\nI think that they're lepers that think that their pleasures are better endeavors\nDon't know about precious but\nSee me? born in a rage\nMaroon blood, coursing my veins\nAs you can see I was born for the stage\nBut, I'll never be their cultural maid\nSome say that we're political\nCos' what they're doing isn't\nDon't they preach a political doctrine called materialism\nBut, for all the Italian clothes that you wear\nOr German cars that you drive\nOr french Champagne that we buy\nWe'll still be monkeys in their eyes\nSo why you are beggin' it\nWho knows, Italians fight to wear Jamaican clothes?\nItalians call their own women hoes?\nFor everyone's entertainment bro?\nBut hey, what do I know\nI'm just the one with the coldest flows\nAll over the globe baddin' down shows\nBut still don't oil my chest and pose\nPose a threat to the power structure\nNever cause' were anything special\nBut because were the people together\nAnd thats the only way things changin'.
