I'm hardly an angel\nLeave that to the Guardian Angel\nThis is the eighties, I'm Arnie\nAnd painfully making your army unfaithful\nHealth and safety; watch your head\nHeavy metal; lots of lead\nBut before I drop you dead\nI'll shred you up like Dr. Zed\nI said \"Zed, let him in\"\nLed Zeppelin\nNever played on David Letterman\nThough that may be irrelevant\nNevertheless it's a hell of method of making it evident\nDan is the cleverest rapper\nTo ever use gaming in tracks\nSetting a precedent that wouldn't ever be bettered\nTil weapons are made into raps\nEighty seven bazillion guns\nA similar number of brilliant puns\nTurn that to cash, gimme the funds\nBack to back with my militant chums\nI'm blasting stacks of straps at prats\nIt's action packed ridiculous fun\nIf kills were calories, that'd be fattening\nFragging a skag and I'm bagging and tagging him\nHaving you lagging and manically panicking\nMan, is it actually happening?\nWell, I'm an assassin assassining you\nSo if that is a fact then it has to be true\nYou're chatting Claptrap\nSo I should grab your nadsack and yank it\nSo your nads are dropping\nLike the stock is on the NASDAQ\nAsshat, don't answer back\nWho the fack is Handsome Jack?\nYou want how many grams of that?\nI'll grind you like my ganja sack\nI will be having you crying in agony\nViolently cracking your violin; Paganini\nMeeny miny mo\nMore money, less problems\nThe bigger the gun, the less nonsense\nI'm less Mark Ronson, more Charles Bronson\nOr a vault Hunter S. Thompson", "year": "2012-09-12"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
