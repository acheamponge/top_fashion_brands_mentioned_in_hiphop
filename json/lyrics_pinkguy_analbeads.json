(there's a lot of blood)\nAnd I need an ambulance! (oh my god, it's huge)\nCall the ambulance! (someone needs to kill that thing)\n\n[Hook]\nNow my ass is bleeding\nAss is bleeding, ass is bleeding\nAss is bleeding, ass is bleeding\n\nAin't nothing wrong with that\nAin't nothing wrong with that\nAin't nothing wrong with that\nAin't nothing wrong with that\n\nMy ass is bleeding\nAss is bleeding, ass is bleeding\nAss is bleeding, ass is bleeding\nAss is bleeding, ass is bleeding\nAss is bleeding\nAss is bleeding, ass is bleeding\nAss is bleeding", "year": "2013-04-26"}]}
