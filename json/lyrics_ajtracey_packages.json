follow back chicks, I'm a leader\nShe don't wanna give blows, she a diva\nShe just wanna give blow to the reefer\nI got a brown skin push-up Latina\nI beat it up, then I bang on the FIFA\nI don't bring your girl round, I'm a teefer\nShe said her team got hotter like a fever\nI ain't tryna be a stayer or a leaver\nI want FaceTime, I don't wanna beat her\nNah, FaceTime, I don't wanna mash that\nTrapstar hoodie and a snapback\nI don't even smoke, but I back straps\nPush up your wig and it snap back\nMy whole team in black cah we're anti\nYour whole team tryna sing like Ashanti\nMy peng tings looking artwork, Banksy\nShe come around then she take off the panty\nWoah, off pant, take off the thong\nUs man were cold from 19 How Long\nI remember getting shots while I'm on FIFA\nThen tryna text like \"AJ, how long?\"\nNow I'm doing shows, I'm earning that wong\nCan't surf with me, the wave is too strong\nTell a man how can trapping be dead\nWhen I been getting all my packs of food gone?\nYeah, my connect's still alive and well\nStill on my case, tryna line up cells\nI'm just tryna cool nuh like Tobz\nLike Gohan, I ain\u2019t tryna find them Cells\nWoah, I used to push Charlie, now Charlie's pushing me\nHad the cats on my line something like Pusha T\nShelled airwaves then I got a music degree\nNot literally, I do music for P\nI ain't gotta bang man using for me\nMy cuz said 'Trace, use it for free'\nI'm active, no way I'm losing the beef\nCome to a show, I got girls in abundance\nFuck the jakes with the cuffs and the truncheons\nCouldn't shut down a PC at your nans gaff\nBut you wanna hate when I'm shutting down functions\nBoom-Burger, double cheese, no onions\nSouth and West, rep both of the Londons\nI was out there getting yacked in Dublin\nDashing Euros down the drain by the hundreds\nMy iPhone died, pissed\nBut it's all good cah the brick phone's banging\nThis ain't just music, hear what I'm saying\nI get the drop, interceptors start slanging\nNo COD, send the opp and I'll frag him\nLike Grim said, \"man ah black bin bag him\"\nStarting with me is a myth, don't do it\nSaw the man bring a big black MAC in\nThe wheel's not deep, look at you catting\nItching your arms, look at you man gagging\nMe, I have fun and I play with the beat\nBut I do when I buss, you can say a man's shagging\nI don't bun dro, that's not me\nBut see me in the party fam, I'm lagging\nLand in the rave, don't need no tagging\nReal name Flex don't need no padding\nDon't pretend to miss the drop like me\nIf you see somebody do it shout 'AJ T'\nCause I fathered the flow, fathered the styley\nBare man wanna be a AJ follower\nI need workers so it's fine by me\nI'll sponsor youts with a few Nike's\nYou're my son if you're running with a style like me\nI said don't pretend to miss the drop like me\nIf you see somebody do it shout 'AJ T'\nCause I fathered the flow, fathered the styley\nBare man wanna be a AJ follower\nI need workers so it's fine by me\nI'll sponsor youts with a few Nikes\nYou're my son if you're running with a style like me\nLadbroke Grove is where I reside\nMan get burst up on the G side\nLast bredda went and got his door kicked off\nAll cause he asked Jay for a 3.5\nAnyone who said he touched me, he lied\nMan thought West was a joke, he tried\nMy block's just like a hornet's nest\nYour block's sweet just like a beehive\nAnywhere that we got beef, we drive\nDidn't even hit him that hard, he died\nIf you get boomed with the 44 long\nCritical hit, no chance to revive\nDon't think cause you got a pouch, you're bad\nKnife in the pouch or not, you'll get skied\nWooden handle on a old school spinner\nHit man with the brunettes, get dyed\nDon't think cause you're in a whip, you're sick\nTings in the car or not, you'll get pitched\nGolden teeth, we loading that scram\nHit man with the blonde tips, get lift\nUs man grind on the road, don't grift\nCall up Strally and make a boy shift\nYour girl said she needs me on her birthday\nI wrapped her pum-pum like \"take this gift\"\nRun up in a man's yard, ask for the raw\nTie a man to a chair or the the front door\nTell a man's mum \"shut your mouth, be quiet\"\nPush man's likkle bro onto the floor\nDash man's Xbox games and a bunch\nThen eat your younger sibling's packed lunch\nDon't think cause I say cool, you're safe\nStill make a man's dad go and hit cunch\n\n[Outro]\nDun know\nAJ from the Lane, get 'em man", "year": "2016-02-22", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/3ad6addd016edef42f2047a6d9576933.629x629x1.png"}], "artist":
