Don't want a vice\nSave us from our saviors\nWhen they sanctify the same they curse\n\n[Hook]\nThey say we're born alone we'll die alone\nI say it's worth it for tonight alone\nSometimes I feel like I'm kaleidoscope\nAlkalines collide inside I feel like I\u2019m kaleidoscope", "album": "Altars"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
