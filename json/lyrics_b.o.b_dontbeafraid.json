Go on and fight!\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell, let me tell you about the story of a brother named Horris\nHe got a dope beat, but can't come up with the chorus\nHis label's on his back, trying to make him a hit\nBecause he got eighty songs, but they don't make sense\nBut, this is his job and he gotta get paid\nSo what else to talk about, besides slanging cocaine?\nAnd why not? He ain't got much to say\n'Cause if he talk about some melty, he'll feel gay\nHis [?] he gotta fix his appearance\nSo he go out and get some jewelry and expenses\nSo when he's on stage and he got a good image\nBut ain't nobody moving cause don't nobody feel him\n'Cause it's the same song with the same old flow\nAnd don't nobody believe him, he can tell he know\n'Cause when his album, ain't no one at the store\nThen the sales go down, and the truth gon' show\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Don\u2019t Be Afraid", "album": "Hi!
