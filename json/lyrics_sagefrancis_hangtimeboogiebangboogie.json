Convince me\n\nI want to believe\nI want to believe that you bleed\nI want to believe that you're bleeding\nJust as much as she did\nI'll experiment with your life until I find it's fucking meaning\nYou will hang, hang\nBang, bang, boogie\n\nShe beat back her attackers with a childhood full of alibis\nAs I understood, she had to lie\nThe battle cries must have adjusted accordingly\nHer stopped calls for help never were answered back\nAnd for that beat by the hands of my clock\nLots can happen in a matter of seconds\nAsk for a repentance from a looking glass\nSelf shattered reflections\nBefore you blame your anger on adolescence\nListen to the symphony of ambulances sing\n\nSo beautiful\nSo nice\nTell me where were you last night?\nAs usual\nYou lied\nTell me where the fuck you hide\n\nIt goes bang, bang, boogie\nUp jumps the party\nI always notice when she has new marks on her body", "album": "The Known Unsoldier...Sick Of Waging War"}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
