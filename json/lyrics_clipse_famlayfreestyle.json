War against an army wit a hand gun\nI'm FamLay, and when my fucking chance come\nI'm running wit it, on e'ry song I'm coming wit' it\nSee some you think you can take from me, then come and get it\nSee I'm from Huntersville, e'ry thang we done is real\nMy niggas come in here, my niggas come to kill\nAnd I dare y'all to try to dis us\nSee you in the streets it ain't nothing discuss\nMaaan, we gon' stomp yo ass dead in the ground\nFEW WEEKS, couple bodies wit no head'll be found, nigga\nCut off ya wrists, and they feet no prints (Gangsta)\nNow I'm in the Six, (Gangsta) wit the heat no tints, you see me boy\n\n[Outro: Pharrell]\nIn Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang\nIn Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang\nIn Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang\nNiggas, bang, bang, bitches, bang, bang\nIn Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang\nIn Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang\nIn Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang\nNiggas, bang, bang, bitches, bang, bang"}], "artist": "Clipse"}
