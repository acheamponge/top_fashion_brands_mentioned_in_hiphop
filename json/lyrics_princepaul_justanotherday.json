Ma Dukes don\u2019t understand the hustle. Ever since I graduated five years ago, she been on my case about everything. Getting a better job, getting out of this neighborhood, keeping an eye on my sister, whatever. But yo, as soon as I get my record deal, everyone\u2019s gonna know what time it is. Especially my boy Tru. He had his chance. He even taught me how to rhyme. But he gave up like a sucka. He blames me for his quittin\u2019.
