Nah, homie, not even\nI'ma zone out 'til I lose feeling, remember\nI'ma be gone way past November\nEven, stay up there, up there\nFloatin', floatin', hopin'\nI can find peace somewhere\n\n[Chorus]\nIn my mind\nIt sounds like oooooooh\nWhen I'm gone\nIt feels like oooooooh\nWhen I'm zoned\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nWhen I'm zoned\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nI forget about it all\n\n[Verse 2]\nBallin', is this allowed?\nWithout feelin' like Shallow Hal\nDiamonds on the Jesus piece for style\nBack in Cleveland City we ride around\nGreetin' my niggas with dap and pound\nSo if I fall I won't hit the ground\nThese are the things that'll make me smile\nKnowin' this blunt might burn a while\nI keep myself so lifted\nI am accustomed to new heights\nI feel perfect though they think it's worthless\nSee without my flight, man\nEverybody wanna be a critic\nI have my life and I will live it\nShut your mouth before I fuck it\nHa, my jokes, they will love it\nIf I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans\nMore than likely I am faded, man\nYou are not the shit if everywhere you go\nNiggas ain't sitting, standing 'round hating, so\nMy vice is \u2014 When the lights start flashin'\nI'll be zonin', all alone then\nAnd the place where my mind is goin'\nFilled with songs that no one's knowin'\nAnd the Devil in a hot pink dress\nTryna ask me for one dance\nHe think he slick\nBut my guardians protect me from his wrath\nSo, in my place no hate shall enter\nLivin' high up there, up there\nCopin', copin', floatin'\nI will find peace somewhere\n\n[Chorus]\nIn my mind\nIt sounds like oooooooh\nWhen I'm gone\nIt feels like oooooooh\nWhen I'm zoned\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nWhen I'm zoned\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nI forget about it all\n\n[Chorus]\nIn my mind\nIt sounds like oooooooh\nWhen I'm gone\nIt feels like oooooooh\nWhen I'm zoned\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nWhen I'm zoned\nI'm feeling alright\nI'm feeling alright\nI forget about it all"}]}
