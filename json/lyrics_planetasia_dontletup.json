Jackson in \"Pulp Fiction\"*\nYeah, we gon' be a bunch of little Fonzi's\nAnd y'all all know what Fonzi was...cool\nThat's right (set it off)\n\n[Talib Kweli, Planet Asia]\nWe in the air like natural and mystic\nOr smoke when the spliff's lit\nDon't bitch if you get your shit split\nCuz you Limp like Bizkit\nSpit and focus, formats my motto\nIn minutes and in precice, this is vintage\nY'all know it only takes a second for mics to get blown\nYou nice, you get known\nHear me twice it's the clone ass nigga wit no life of his own\nThis is it, as Planet sets flames to the journal in your section\nWit Kweli from Reflection Eternal\nBig up my nigga Hi-Tek steady rockin the spot\nThese niggas styles so dead that they startin to rot\nWe got the market on stock\nWit hot drops and big bookings\nHow we leave shows shooken up from Fresno to Brooklyn\nNew York City cost of livin, type high\nWe type fly, roll a white guy\nLight it up like Manhattan in the night sky\nWord, and it's no Mister Nice Guy\nShow you how we slice pies\nDivided in between the scheme of nighttime\n\n[Hook--Planet Asia, Talib Kweli]\n\"Don't let up\"\nWe keep it movin with the movement\nBeats by my brethren, 427\n\"Don't let up\"\nKeep on making the street songs with the beat strong\nEach one, we gotta teach one\n\"Don't let up\"\nIt's Planet Asia and Talib Kweli\nShoutouts to J-F, my click, and that nigga JOEY T.!!!\n\"Don't let up\"\nBlackstar to Cali Agents, these cats are amazing\nMost rappers are foul and flagrant\n\n[Planet Asia]\nI keep rhymes on floss, retardedly smart\nWit fine-printed sheets folded\nA book of such pages, a nine inch octavolts\nIt's cultural warfare where shots fire rapidly\nCats plastically resign drastically\nC'mon, up in the house you got the mic\nVeteran slight, better than all your favorite rappers\nGuess I'm about to make some cheddar\nThan y'all, should fall abrupt\nOnce the measuring starts\nI spit bars in twenty-fours and cut vocals without editing\nI'm long-winded, styles intrigue through these vaccuum lungs\nAlthought my family be toking major trees\nMy performance forever powerful\nThese beats got me spittin Frank Sinatra's\nAnd wilding out on bank accountants\nIt's chronic slaughter, ionic orders doric\nNow dine a novel to the face, I lace cats with the prehistoric\nMedicinal metaphoric assorted for clientele\nMy whole crew circulating just like Japanese tourists\nAnd I clap MC's flawless\nKnow what I'm sayin?\nI stays blunted with about a hundred thousand choruses\nAnd crush mode, baby up those stats\nI used to bust flows back in the day\nI'll probably rush you\nLike fuck those raps!\nPitch black, spittin at the park\nSeventy, perform the benches, triple-loaded in the dark\nI started noticing my glow in the dark was right\nFrom then on, I was always able to rock the mic unordinary from yours\nLegendary till you bury the sword\nMarry ya broad, scary how I carry the gorge\nOf every applaud, I'm heavy like a 70's Ford\nFor the cheddy and I'm ready and raw\n\n[Hook--Talib Kweli, Planet Asia]\n\"Don't let up\"\nKillin the track, chill in the back\nUntil it's time to hit the stage and begin healing the raps\n\"Don't let up\"\nWe all inside of the place\nWith big bitches, step to this and end up dividing the cake\n\"Don't let up\"\nYou gotta hear us, so we slow it up\nLet me see your fist, throw it up, every spot we blow it up\n\"Don't let up\"\nWe keep it movin with the movement\nBeats by my brethren, 427\n\n[Talib Kweli]\nMy man Planet Asia already broke down the science to my name\nI speak to the silent and the tame\nAnd the violent in the brain\nI'm the pilot in the plane\nI'm still Soundbombing shit\nDominant when I be flowin\nCats get broken like promises\nFuck the politics, my partnership with artists who\nPut their heart in it, that's why my crew spit the hardest shit\nFor the art of it, we start the shit and get it HYPE\nCuz hearing me and this man here rock together, yo it's like\nMixing Northern Lights from the Bay\nWith Yard weed from Jamaica\nOr the best from the Knicks with the best of the Lakers\nWe the creators, never the imitators of the slave traders\nAll y'all niggas is just cartoons put to music like Fantasia\nFrom the planet of Brooklyn to Planet Asia\nI'll pull your card, I'm all around, I see your hand plus I'll raise ya\nLike children, just for the sake of smacking you when you outta place\nYou don't get hits, niggas make errors, try to run home\nYou out at the plate (YOU'RE OUT!)\nI make wack niggas light my L then I put it out on they face\nFrom New York to California, I'll run you all out of the state\nOf mind you currently residin in\nThe difference is you try to win\nYou believe what they sayin, you on your knees like you prayin\nYou ain't got to sweat the ice and money, they know people promise me\nWith one rhyme I probably could break down your whole psychology\nNiggas is Hollywood like the church of Scientology\nIf I drop African thought\nThey probably would lie and say it's Greek philosophy\n\n[Hook--Planet Asia, Talib Kweli]\n\"Don't let up\"\nGet rowdy if ya feelin it\nWe all about killin it\nYa feelin it? Well get with it then\n\"Don't let up\"\nKilllin the track, chill in back\nTill it's time to hit the stage and bring healing to rap\n\"Don't let up\"\nWe still down for the cause\nWith or without fame, stickin to the old school laws\n\"Don't let up\"\nYou gotta hear us, so we slow it up\nLet me see your fist, throw it up, every spot we blow it up", "year": null}]}
