What use does it have? What function does it serve? I mean, obviously I know the answer, but it's a sort of rhetorical quesiton I suppose. So maybe you think about it whether...whether it's good for the gaming community, whether it's good for the industry, what your thoughts about it are. I'm very keen to know!", "year": "2012-03-30"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
