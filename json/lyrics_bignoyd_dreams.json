Straight off from the boss shine [???],/ heat holder,/ and the dees rolled up, bustin' shots, then the dream is over!\n\n[Hook]\n\u201eI see pies every time my eyes cl-idd-ose\u201c \u201eI got dreams\u201c \u201eIt was all a dream\u201c \u201eStartin' shit in my hood, I can't have it!\u201c \u201e[So we were ...]\u201c\n\u201eI see pies every time my eyes cl-idd-ose\u201c \u201eI got dreams\u201c \u201eIt was all a dream\u201c \u201eStartin' shit in my hood, I can't have it!\u201c \u201eQueensbridge and we don't play!\u201c\n\n[Part 2]\nI was on the fast pace/ up in a rat race/ and a high speed car chase/ with niggas that car jack!/ Ride/Right, you get your homicide, bounce without a trace!/ The victim and the head, they left 'em here without his face/faith!/ You won't see a thing, all you hearin' is sirens!/\nAll you know, with the New York City boy be wary!/ And my words and my beats comin',/ knockin'/ through the stereo!/ Don't confuse me with the fake rappers on the radio!/ More talent, more style and plus I let the semi go,/ not the one stuntin', flashin' guns in the video!/ Live it/ more vivid,/ I don't need to be dramatized/drama-typed!/ Better say my name cause I'm not the one who let it ride!/ (Nigga!)\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Big Noyd"}
