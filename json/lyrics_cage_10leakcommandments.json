Cut that shit with lighter fluid\nKeep the heat in reach but act casual\nDustheads act all violent and irrational\nNumber 3: don't trust no phencyclidine\nThat's the rogue agent in death\nThat's out to get your team\nFormaldehyde ain't really got pcp in it\nCopping yellow shit, somebody could've peed in it\nNumber 4: this don't really fly no more\nCause dudes don't get high on they own supply\nNumber 5: Never sell shit out the house\nYou'd be surprised the smell of clientele from one liquid ounce\nNumber 6: the cash, no sherm man fuck credit\nThan bitch slap him for asking\nTo demonstrate your work ethic\n7: come up with names like lethal weapon\nThrow a stamp on the envelope that's only a suggestion\nGet your weight up filling up caskets\nKeep that shit in glass cause I've seen it eat right through plastic\nNumber 8: keep some cigarettes with you\nThose cats who puff for free\nCan hold dips too\nNumber 9 Should've been number 1 to me\nDon't get caught\nIf you do don't talk to police\nIf cats think you're snitching\nThey might come through your kitchen\nAnd cut your bitch into little pieces and go fishing\nNumber 10: read this shit again when you're way sober\nIf you ain't write it down or print it out then play it over\nFollow these rules in no time you'll do it\nStupid motherfuckers be puffing embalming fluid\nCheck\nRule number 3 is see I'm stating facts\nLeak carry the same charge as pumping H and Crack\nI know chicks that get wet just for a drag of wet\nImagine what these hoes will do for a whole bag of death\nSome nice tits to fumble could catch you on a humble\nFuck around and lose a whole bundle\nBeads in the bottle are your starter kicks\nI gotta go I got another jar to mix"}]}
