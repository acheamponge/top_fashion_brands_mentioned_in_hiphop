Gotta pick one\nAin't got goddamn time to be watching my back\nIf I feel played then I'm gon' clip something\nYeah, I got trust issues, no, I don't trust niggas\nNigga got killers in the back, gon' rip somethin\nHell nah, I don't trust bitches, nah, I don't trust bitches\nGo'n bring the sack to a nigga, let me pimp somethin'\nRollin' them lil' ass blunts, tryna skimp somethin', hey\nBeat it from the back, yellin' kill somethin'\nBeen fuckin' this bitch for a long, long time\nShe ask do I got feelings? I don't feel nothin', hey\nNigga talk tough, ain't drill nothin'\nHow you say you a jacker, you ain't peel nothin'?\nNigga picked up my hearse, tryna take him off the Earth\nBut yeah, pussy nigga, I'm still coming\nNo battle of the band, a nigga still drummin'\nI'm a fresh prince like Uncle Phil comin'\nNigga can't be around me, you ain't kill for me\nI ain't worried 'bout buddy but it's still fuck him, hey\nAnd I'll still up the steel on him\nAnd I still got steel for your lil' homie, hey\nNigga's heart cold 'cause they flipped on me, yeah\nFlex on a bitch nigga, drip on him, yeah, yeah yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI keep it I keep it G from the dawn to the dusk\nTo be honest with you, it's hard for me to love\nSay with me it'll be love, then it's love\nAnd I cannot lie, it's hard for me to trust\nWhat is trust? What is trust? What is trust?\nAyy, I cannot lie, it's hard for me to trust\nWhat is trust? What is trust?
