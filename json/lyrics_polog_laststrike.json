That shit be strange\nIt ain't my fault that you fucked up, I ain't the one to blame\nStill ain't got off your ass yet, all you did was complain\nGrown ass man lookin' for a handout, you should be ashamed\nOnce you stop fuckin' with 'em, they start throwin' dirt all on your name\nBut every nigga deep in my circle know that I'm still the same\nI always kept it a hundred so how the fuck I change?\nNo, I never been the type to go against the grain\nAin't wanna cut you off, you don't think that caused me pain?\nI had to separate myself and just stay in my lane\nEverybody ain't real, lot of niggas just be in this shit for fame\nThat social media been fuckin' up these niggas' brains\nThey'll sell they soul for a lil' attention, man, that shit be lame\nDid certain shit that you can't take back and you can't explain\nBeen tryna keep my composure, they gon' make me go insane\nMight put them shooters on your ass, and they got perfect aim\n\n[Chorus]\nGave you one hundred strikes, you was askin' for it and your wish was granted\nFelt like you would jeopardize what I had goin', nigga, I couldn't chance it\nAnd I know you bitch-made so I don't expect you to understand it\nI know you furious 'cause I'm banded up and my diamonds dancing\nHoppin' out of first class in another state, my plane just landed\nAll you had to do was play your role, I wouldn't've left you stranded\nAin't how I wanted shit to go, that wasn't the way I planned it\n'Cause I been there before, know what it's like to feel abandoned\n\n[Verse 2]\nNigga, for my family, did what I did, I don't need validation\nMy mama the only one ever came to bond me up out that station\nSittin' in that cell, I used to feel like my potential wasted\nI finally know what the top feel like, I come from that basement\nEverybody latching on, tryna benefit from my situation\nI ran that bag up, you in your head making up calculations\nEvery time I look up, it's a soft ass nigga clout chasing\nI grinded hard for the spot I got, they wish we traded places\nI'm living lavish now and I guess you wanted an invitation\nI'm tryna understand what make you think that I'm obligated\nNo, I can't kick it with you no more, my nigga, that ball deflated\nI knew you was never really rootin' for me, I used to peep the hatin'\nSo many times I was in denial, but I just had to face it\nGave you an inch, you took a mile, now look what I created\nAlways lookin' for your cut, worried 'bout what I'm makin'\nPosted with you, that's what I went through on a daily basis\n\n[Chorus]\nGave you one hundred strikes, you was askin' for it and your wish was granted\nFelt like you would jeopardize what I had goin', nigga, I couldn't chance it\nAnd I know you bitch-made so I don't expect you to understand it\nI know you furious 'cause I'm banded up and my diamonds dancing\nHoppin' out of first class in another state, my plane just landed\nAll you had to do was play your role, I wouldn't've left you stranded\nAin't how I wanted shit to go, that wasn't the way I planned it\n'Cause I been there before, know what it's like to feel abandoned", "year": "2019-06-07"}]}
