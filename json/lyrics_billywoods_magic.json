Taiwo Whetstone - \u201cMagic\u201d\n[Emcee(s): billy woods and Taiwo Whetstone]\n[Producer(s): Dan Datiles]\n[Additional Instrumentation: Emile McGloin]\n[Vocals: Taiwo Whetstone]\n\n[Verse 1: billy woods]\nMagic in cellophane pressed on windowpanes\nRhyming out storm drains.  Our blues is more\nWetter.  Too young to know better\n\n[Verse 2: Taiwo Whetstone]\nOur\nDays were cold and nights were worse\nIt seemed right at first, but when light dispersed\nOn the scene, in spite of hurt, I felt\nThe pressure pulling, I felt the less and less I say will, um\nKeep my head together \u2018fore I lose it\nWrapped up like sweaters in my problems\nToo young to know better, can\u2019t solve \u2018em\nCan\u2019t keep wasting time, can\u2019t keep chasing each\nNight like I\u2019m hanging from a breaking vine.  I need\nTo make in mind.  I\u2019m lying hate\nBut draped in my emotions, fragrance if a sacred sight\nBathed in a flame from an ancient night\nBeen shone over the graves of the native\nTribes\n\n[Verse 3: billy woods]\nRushing rivers washing shattered slivers glittering\nIn hands cupped, red-eyed showers still finding her\nBad luck, knotted strands grief-struck, fuck\nNothing gold can stay, plucked, swept away\nTime\u2019s breeze turns gale, howling gusts\nAnd heaves, gray skies bereaved, dead leaves\nRake \u2018em before it rains, boy.  Rake \u2018em\nBefore it rains.  Pain bonded to frame like I\nInvented the chains on slaves half-lame\nFitting atonement for lost moments gnawing the brain\nForgotten spells, pixie dust, cocaine\nNumbing kisses of lips glossed lost like\nBoats, torrents, swollen oceans, torn sails\nBlack veils, white whales.  Dead men tell\nNo tales"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
