We differed\nSo I left em in the dust to the point they have to swiffered\nI rock mics like Hammer rocked British Knights\nThis year I'm in the UK sipping Guinness pints\nIn a nice pub with my man Adam Gibbons\nTil then I'm in America having Ribbons\nYeah, but as the plot gets thicker\nIt's way more music a lot less liquor\nFor years I've been on that \"party all night\" shit\nThis year I'm on some \"take charge of my life\" shit\nAll day, every day, any time, heavy grind\nWhether I'm signed or unsigned I'm getting mine\n\"Sun never setting\" shine, constantly\nRun to the betting line, odds on me\nIt may seem like an unsafe wager\nCause my musics way too unsafe for a major\nThey want it in a box like Digidesign\nIt all sounds pretty similar like Biggie and Shyne\nThe music industry is a little behind\nThe other day I had a feeling I was finna to get signed\nI looked on my balcony and a pigeon arrived\nIt had a record contract in its beak\nWith a note attached that said please have this back in a week\nJust sign it and date and put it back in the beak\nI seen a footnote on my third read\nNo postage necessary just bird seed\nYeah, a lot of rappers spit cleverly\nBut on top of the game they'll never be\nIf you want to eat the caviar and fresh frog legs\nYou gon' need a hook like golf with left dog legs\nAnd I got that skill\nBut these old industry crackers think I'm not that ill\nFuck em, I'll get YouTube dollars instead\nFuck Akon on the hook, I'm a holler at Fred\nAnd y'all think I'm lyin\nI send him messages he just ain't replyin'\nHis assistant told me he's on the Cayman islands\nWith a bunch of naked dimes, bathin in diamonds\nAnd I'm a get there with him\nBased on mastering the kick snare rhythm\nI'm the shit like guano, sick like mono\nDon't push me, I'm close to the edge like Bono\nAnd from '010 until\nIt ain't gon be no time to chill\nWe gon be making more sounds and creeping on more tours\nInvading your towns and sleeping on your floors\nStaying awake is the cousin of life\nAnd for me sleep and death are now husband and wife\nI'm a lock myself up and write songs in a cave\nAnd flip shit like the master belongs to the slave\nAnd in advance you can thank me, please\nFor filling up all of your blank CD's\nI'm ain't stopping in this game until we run that shit\nAnd I still wild out saying dumb ass shit\nI fucked your mom in one room shack\nBroke the bitch back like I stepped on a crack\nShe was rubbing my feet to put me in the right mood\nShe said, \"What type of socks are those?\"\nI told her, \"White Tube\"\nYou don't wanna rap after me\nYou'll never be invited back like Kramer to the Laugh Factory\nI'm leaving competition so shook\nThis year we stacking up more wins than a Vietnamese phone book\nYeah, I give a fuck about a hater\nTip said it best, \"My time is too greater\"\nCause if I don't spit flows better than a mug\nNo one at a Phish shows ever did a drug\nCome on celebrate, go and light the Christmas trees\nEverybody smile like colon right parenthesis\nHappy New Year for 2000 and 10\nAnd peace to my brothers Herbal T and EOM", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6f0817252fcc664558dc80369900bc26.320x320x1.jpg", "album": "Scrublife", "title": "2010 Til Infinity"}]}
