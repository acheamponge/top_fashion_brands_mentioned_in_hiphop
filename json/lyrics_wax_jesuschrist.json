Ron Hubbard\nIt hurts like a bitch, bruh\nI don't scream out Hare Krishna, hey\nI don't even really know what Hare Krishna did\nOr what his historical significance is\n\n[Outro]\nThat's for all my 80's rap fans", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4bc8913b2dd7d9cd803c4dd33ffb5834.999x999x1.jpg", "album": "Acoustic Monday Album", "title": "Jesus Christ"}]}
