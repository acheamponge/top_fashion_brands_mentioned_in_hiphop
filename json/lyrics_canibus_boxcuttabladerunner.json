Go ahead try a theme\nGimme a person, place, or thing - I'll create the time and scene\nSomewhere in Afghanistan, U.S.A survival teams\nKeep a eye on their surroundings in the Jihad Regime\nA total riot scene, back and forth they encrypt fiber optic beams\nOn my album out next spring\nYou motherfuckin right nigga I'm about that cream\nI promised my self I wouldn't shoot it without that scene\nIt doesn't look right like Cash Money without that bling\nSiblings, I mean we all got the same last name\nGermaine Williams, that's my name\nSay it again Germaine Williams, damn\nI think he goes by the name of the Canibus Man\nAnd occasionally Rip the Jacker but never Stan\nGet it through your head and don't ask me again\nBox cutter, blade runner nigga rap 'til you sweat\nHave you ever read the book called \"The Catcher in The Rye\"?\nIt so happens I'm looking for a copy I could buy\nCanibus is comin for y'all round the outside\nRound the outside, round the outside\nA lotta y'all shine, but y'all can't rhyme\nAnd it's about time that I put y'all in line\nTwist your mind with twisted rhymes\nAs weird as Michael Jackson's nose from the side\nFlows that'll buy the quite bow for the times\nNo need to hide your friends are all associates of mine\nDont be a stranger come over some time\nI got coke if you do lines, you get a Rover to drive\nIf you hear the engine knockin, just pull over to the side\nI guess it hasn't been serviced in all this time\nHalloween: True Hollywood Stories release date\nWe should have a \"Who Wants to Battle Canibus?\" sweepstakes\nAnd limit it to three states; New York City: home of the greats\nPhilly and out West, piece-a-cake\nOld school rappers, I wouldn't be around without\nAin't got shit to say but keep puttin' albums out\nDon't let what I said get you upset\nBox cutter, blade runner nigga rap 'til you sweat..."}]}
