I'm like Superman\nYeah, the Man of Steel, don't you know the deal?\nYou better be for real, I got sex appeal\nThis is what I feel, and this here's my vow\nAnd now you know the brother with know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?\n\nI got know-how...\nAnd I'm chillin'\nNever illin'\nIn my mouth, I got two fillins...\nWhatever!\nI'm on the mic, cold stone gettin' over\nMy name is Young MC, known as the fly casanova, kick it...", "album": "Stone Cold Rhymin\u2019", "year": "1989-09-05", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7e9ff08751b8e32d468ac9e4127b8bec.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young MC"}
