We all records\nSoda Niwas\nMaitidevi, Ghattekulo-32\n\nThey says you came in the game straight out of the blues\nPut your first mixtape out and it just blew\nYou probably don't have a clue\nHow's my life have been yo\n4 degrees in 8 years out of window\nProlly can't bear to hear what I've been told\nBeen broken and joking and everything you touch been gold\nFinally first like I hit that lottery bingo\nLife can be bitch though\nHitting all that symbals\nBut when I tried mingle\nWaiting for the day when I dropped my first and now I'm going single\nSo I can really look off to all of my people\nAnd even if I die I wouldn't be worry to leave you\nAnd all my brothers had rep in this city I see you\nAama how I wish I didn't have to leave you\nAnd also all these bitches tryna scan me down to see you\nBut then you say love me, I can't believe you\nSo I have slip onto the next one\nI ain't looking for love, see I just wanna sex once\nOut of all these bitches, I've been in the VIP section\nMight just take the next time, like the best one", "title": "Intro"}]}
