They tell me life is a balance, put it all on a scale\nAnd try to weigh it up but it\u2019s just a couple of nails\nLiving by the Spirit, but sometimes it just seems like it\u2019s a hole inside my ceiling\nAll the rain that I\u2019ve been feeling\nRain coming through my ceiling, dealing with what I deal with\nI don\u2019t know if he hear me, but I do know how I\u2019m feeling\n\u2018Cause I, I never get drizzles - only pouring rain\nBut somebody told me endure, it\u2019s just a growing pain\u201d\nWell, look all that I could roam through\nIs not who\u2019s holding on, it\u2019s who you are holding on to\nSame God that save me, same God that\u2019ll keep me\nWhen life\u2019s turbulence is tryna defeat me\nThough I\u2019m fighting through the struggling and stressin\u2019\nThrough it all I\u2019ve learned one life lesson, I can\u2019t let go\n\n[Chorus - B.Reith]\nWhen the rain falls, and the wind blows\nI\u2019ll keep holding on to you\nWhen my eyes can\u2019t see what\u2019s in front of me\nI\u2019ll keep holding on to you\nI can\u2019t let go\n\n[Verse 2 - S.O.]\nWhat I fear in my heart groaning\nStare at my past and see all of the stark moments\nAll of my dark growing, no need to ask\nI have seen with the cross, take a seat on my path\nDark nights when I can see that they\u2019re easily marred\nA harsh plight I demonstrate but could easily mask\nMaybe reckon I was getting the deception every second\nHear the messes in my message, how evil we are\nThis is an evil in chant, no letting go, don\u2019t let it\nSee the Son throw reverend, bring him stronghold wreckage\nOne hope even when the storms go stressing\nKeep your long nose \u2018cause we got the Lord though, get it?\nSo \u2018cause of Jesus, I ain\u2019t never letting go\nRather he ain\u2019t letting me; I\u2019m the sheep, he\u2019s the G.O.A.T\nThe greatest of all treasures, you should see, then you know\nThat the storms brew, but I never cease from his whole life\n\n[Chorus - B.Reith]\nWhen the rain falls, and the wind blows\nI\u2019ll keep holding on to you\nWhen my eyes can\u2019t see what\u2019s in front of me\nI\u2019ll keep holding on to you\nI can\u2019t let go\n\n[Hook - B.Reith]\nOh oh oh oh\nI can\u2019t let go oh oh oh oh\nThese storms keep coming and they won\u2019t stop raining\nMy heart\u2019s been flooded, now I just can\u2019t take it no more\nI can\u2019t keep going on\nBut when I\u2019m weak, you\u2019re strong\nAnd you keep holding on to me, I can\u2019t let go\n\n[Chorus - B.Reith]\nWhen the rain falls, and the wind blows\nI\u2019ll keep holding on to you\nWhen my eyes can\u2019t see what\u2019s in front of me\nI\u2019ll keep holding on to you\nI can\u2019t let go"}], "artist": "Json"}
