Get off my cloud\nYou don't know pal, my gun go BLAO!\nAnother brother confused and I'm so foul\nAnother mother will lose one mo' child\nPeople said, \"Josephine, your son's so wild\nWhat could make him run so wild?\nYou better keep his ass out of the street or else he gon' go down\nRun around here with guns like he the king of the whole town\nYesterday, he showed me a fo'-pound\nLoaded clips, swearin' to God he won't waste no round\"\nMy mom give 'em a fake smile and turn 'em away\nShe used to seein' her baby with the burner and HEY\nAnd yo, before she let him get away, she stop him and say\nYou know what she say? (No, what did she say?)\nShe say, she say, \"What do you say to a kid that'd take his life and give it away\nAnd only live for the day?\"\nI was just talkin' to the lil' nigga today\nAnd when he play with that thing, I make him put it away\nShe say, \"What do you say to a kid who been in and out of court\nSince his ass was like four feet short?\"\nI don't know what the fuck y'all thought\nThat lil' nigga is a gangsta.  Haha\nAnd now my mom's tellin' me to listen\n\"Son, you can't afford another felony conviction\nThey got you labeled as a menace to this jurisdiction\nThey gon' try come get you and stick you in a prison\nSon, I know you only a victim of the system\nGiuliani hate your black skin\u2014you could even ask him", "album": "Abandoned Tracks Vol. 2"}], "artist": "Saigon"}
