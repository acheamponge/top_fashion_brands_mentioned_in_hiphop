Knoc-Turn'al\nYup... Let's go\n\n[Verse 1: Knoc-Turn'al]\nIt's amazing...how outta my life I made-short a long-story\nI came a long way outta bullshit, but I ask for no glory\nI came a long way from the pavement on the block, stackin' dough\nAnd on a long day there would be a raid, and business was slow\nHow many times must I see a victim losing a life?\nHow many days must I hustle, 'fore my hustle get right?\nHow many days must the children duck when bullets take flight?\nHow would a gang act when one of they own is dying tonight?\n\n[Chorus: Blaq Rose]\nUntil the day (honey)\nI wanna be right where you are. (whoa-oh, oh-oh)\nI wanna hold you in my arms (my arms)\nI wanna be your shining star (I wanna be)\nUntil that day\nI wanna be right where you are. (whoa-oh, oh-oh)\nI wanna hold you in my arms (aw yeah)\nGonna' be your shining st-arr (whoah-oh-ah-whoa)\n\n[Verse 2: Knoc-Turn'al]\nIt's amazing, how hard times; they come and they go\nIn the ghetto, these ghetto days we go with the flow\nI spent my whole life hustlin'; grindin' the streets\nAnd when hard times came, I regrouped and stood on my feet\nWhen will it be safe for kids to go outside again?\nWhen will the day come for us to love, and embrace a friend?\nI travel all around the world workin', gettin' it right\nBecause the world is a ghetto, and the ghetto's my life\n\n[Chorus: Blaq Rose]\nUntil the day (honey)\nI wanna be right where you are. (whoa-oh, oh-oh)\nWanna hold you in my arms (my arms)\nWanna be your shining star (I wanna be)\nUntil that day\nI wanna be right where you are. (whoa-oh, oh-oh)\nWanna hold you in my arms (aw yeah)\nGonna' be your shining st-arr (whoah-oh-ah-whoa)\n\n[Verse 3: Knoc-Turn'al]\nIt's amazing, how mothers in ghetto's hold they heads high\nAnd when times get too hard, they just look to the sky\nPour out some drink, 'cause the homie would'a been 30 today\nBut tragedy struck at 14, and took him away\nI want a new life where families don't have to cry no mo'\nI know kids in the ghetto listen to Knoc-Turn'al\nUntil the day I get all my peoples off of the streets\nIm'a be here: puttin' it down for L.A.C\n\n[Chorus: Blaq Rose]\nUntil the day (honey)\nI wanna be right where you are. (whoa-oh, oh-oh)\nI wanna hold you in my arms (my arms)\nI wanna be your shining star (I wanna be)\nUntil that day\nI wanna be right where you are. (whoa-oh, oh-oh)\nI wanna hold you in my arms (aw yeah)\nGonna' be your shining st-arr (whoah-oh-ah-whoa)\n\n[Bridge: Instrumental - 8 bars]\n\n[Chorus: Blaq Rose]\nUntil the day (honey)\nI wanna be right where you are. (whoa-oh, oh-oh)\nI wanna hold you in my arms (my arms)\nI wanna be your shining star (I wanna be)\nUntil that day\nI wanna be right where you are. (whoa-oh, oh-oh)\nI wanna hold you in my arms (aw yeah)\nGonna' be your shining st-arr (whoah-oh-ah-whoa)"}]}
