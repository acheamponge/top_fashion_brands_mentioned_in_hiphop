Listen\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou get your smile from your mom\nYou kinda walk like your auntie\nDaddy girl, you hate the drama\nBut you get your dimples from your granny\nLike a queen girl you got swag\nBut all the other girls they hate that\nYou're strong like your grand daddy\nNothing's perfect but you make me happy\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nCause girl you, got that fire burnin' down in my soul\nWith you, by my side feels like I'll never grow old\n\n[Hook] (x2)\nI'm talking 'bout the soul of a woman\nSo good to see\nThat it feels so good to be loved by you\nAnd a wonderful place to be\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou learn to cook from your granny\nBut you're gettin' mad like your auntie\nHome remedies from your mom\nBut she get 'em all from your granny\nYour my queen so you got swag\nBut all the other girls they hate that\nYou're strong like your grand daddy\nNothing's perfect but you make me happy\n\n[Pre-Hook] + [Hook] (x2)\n\n[Interlude]\nYeah\nIt's a great honor and a pleasure\nTo introduce to you tonight\nOn guitar\nOur very own\nJ-Mo"}], "artist": "BJ the Chicago Kid"}
