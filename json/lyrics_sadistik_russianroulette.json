I am Mister Self-Destruct\nI'm in your blood you're a victim of the rush\nBut you're flirting with disaster when you kiss and tell my love\nMake more beds of nails so you can stay warm\nSang chords in a medley 'til my face tore\nPray for living dead that walk and pace forth\nRain pours in my head, it's called a brainstorm\nThis game you're playing is so tedious\nBlack out on white lies and blame it on bulimia\nYea, now I'm saying all your secrets huh\nShould've thought twice before you grazed with your demon's touch\nNo disrespect but the real love doesn't show\n'til I kiss your neck and my steel tongue cuts your throat\nI feel numb when the tears run uncontrolled\nLike it's synthemesc and I steal some of your soul\nUntil the self-help starts\nWhen you'd bite my heart to see if it was really made of gold\nI extinguished flames until hell fell dark\nAnd buried bodies under floorboards like Tell Tale Heart, so run\n\n[Hook: Yes Alexander]\nI will not watch you pray\nAs the steel shaft enters your brain\nTell me baby how many times\nOne thousand tries\nYou're still alive\n\n[Verse 2: Cage]\nI don't really think that I'm often ill\nWhat would you wear to death a cross or nil\nShould've known she was only out to fill\nSome sort of void I was out to kill\nAny time left was the sand that fell\nAnything to keep me from standing still\nSpend it like you happened to land a mil\nWake up throwing up random pills\nYou want to feel it under your bones in your marrow\nYou hope cupid ran off with more arrows\nBetter off in passage ways to find pharaohs\nWhen the road you walk is too narrow\nStart flying stop falling\nLike you did when you first stopped crawling\nThrew it all on the table and went all in\nCause I knew it had to be my calling\n\n[Hook: Yes Alexander]\nI will not watch you pray\nAs the steel shaft enters your brain\nTell me baby how many times\nOne thousand tries\nYou're still alive\n\n[Sadistik]\nNothing's what it seems, life is but a dream\nAnd I'm busy sleepwalking to find out what it means", "album": "Flowers For My Father"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
