Here's the facts, I'm a basket case\n\n[Hook]\nGet money, motherfucker get right\nGet a blunt, get a bottle, get nice\nGet a grip cause as soon as you slip, that's it\nSet trip nigga, get life\nGet money, motherfucker get right\nGet a blunt, get a bottle, get nice\nGet a grip cause as soon as you slip, that's it\nSet trip nigga, get life", "year": null}]}
