Please pray for me\nI can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go\nTell heaven \"don't wait for me\"\nSatan waitin' at the gate for me\nI heard this bitch bump Lil Peep faithfully\nThat's why these pussies got hate for me\n'Cause they was busy chasin' bitches, I was chasin' dreams\nThrow me off the edge, I'll fall\nLookin' up at 'em like I never even knew 'em at all\nI remember walkin' around in the hall\nAnd then the bell rang and I took something then I couldn't recall\nMakin' you cry the way she did, I can't forgive myself for\nAnd if you want me to, I'll kill myself, but I'm already in hell for it\n\n[Verse]\nYou used to love me then, I know it's not the same\nBut this is not the end 'cause everything gon' change\nWhen I get that Benz, I'ma pull up in the rain and I'm gon' say\nYou wouldn't wait (Skrrt)\n\n[Chorus]\nHave you ever seen a man this rich, this broke?\nThis lost in the smoke? Please pray for me\nI can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go\nTell heaven \"don't wait for me\"\nSatan waitin' at the gate for me\nI heard this bitch bump Lil Peep faithfully\nThat's why these pussies got hate for me\n'Cause they was busy chasin' bitches, I was chasin' dreams\nThrow me off the edge, I'll fall\nLookin' up at 'em like I never even knew 'em at all\nI remember walkin' around in the hall\nAnd then the bell rang and I took something then I couldn't recall\nMakin' you cry the way she did, I can't forgive myself for\nAnd if you want me to, I'll kill myself, but I'm already in hell for it"}], "artist": "Lil Peep"}
