I'm not just trying to say imma come out and sell 10 million\n\n[Verse 1]\nUh\nI see they faces and see the way they be looking at me\nMost 'em wanna ask me \"Yo bishop are you livin' happy?\"\nIs that smile plastered on or do you have it naturally\nActually I'm just knowing this the matrix in reality\nSo ain't no way that I'm getting misplaced by the salary\nTryna get ahead and leave 'em burnt like calories\nCasually killing casualties, battles end in catastrophes\nI'm catchin' fees and they tryna catch up to me\nBut don't you see imma continue sippin' tea\nGathering an assembly of fans who will remember me\nWhen I'm history and vividly a figure in it\nI'm in general a general and you just the lieutenant\nYou adjusted to get it\nGot it, I stuck to my physics\nI could tell if your brain controlled, gimmie some minutes\nBut really it ain't my business, been busy in gettin' bishes\nMid-wise I be chillin' high up on Olympus\n\n[Hook]\nI remember they ain't think that I could win this (Nah)\nNow they all 'bout to witness (Yeah)\nI been workin' all night like it's fitness, and they still no finish (Nah)\nBut the craft way higher than the business (Way higher)\nAnd it still never switches (Nah)\nI remember they ain't think that I could win this (Never this)\nNow they all 'bout to witness\n\n[Verse 2]\nFact of the matter, this places here's gettin' sadder\nSleepin' on the data and in love with the chatter\nSplit his daggers between the actors and naggers\nThis place is badder, then badder than it has to be\nA happy me is what I'd rather see\nSo I'm gradually evolving into the beast I seen in elementary\nWhile I rock hard it's sedimentary, I said that this was meant for me\nAnd ain't a soul believe, till they seen me over sicily\nThen she been consistently, rippin' these\nBelieve it or not, like Ripley's\nBeen on my hymnin' magician before I was a teen\nSo it's hard to find minds who truly get what I mean\nLike the average\nI focused on the passage and it helped, with my baggage\nNow the kid's the illest package, other cats get packin'\nWe ain't in the same bracket\nThis is light like practice, he cacked his jack rabbit\n\n[Hook]\nI remember they ain't think that I could win this (Nah)\nNow they all 'bout to witness (Yeah)\nI been workin' all night like it's fitness(I been workin'), and they still no finish\nBut the craft way higher than the business (Way higher)\nAnd it still never switches (Nah)\nI remember they ain't think that I could win this (Nah, Never)\nNow they all 'bout to witness\nThe emperor\n\n[Outro]\nThe emperor\nThe emperor\nThe emperor"}], "artist": "Bishop Nehru"}
