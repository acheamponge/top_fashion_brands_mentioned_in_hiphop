I take heed and pick up the pace\nCan't explain it when I pick up my son and look at my face\nI'm like a black rose growin' in the concrete crackin' the pavement\nThere that voice go again \"Mack practice for greatness\nGet paid for them immaculate statements\"\nKeep thinkin' of them hot lines, like a physic, I can't explain it\nThere's no pen when I write it, it's nothing like it\n\n[Interlude]\nGoddamn, what you want from me\nWhat you want me to tell you huh?\nNiggas thought that I would stutter huh, thought I was dumb\n\n[Verse 2]\nBut I ain't used to use my mind, I used to just use my 9\nAnd run wild with my boys, in the streets wild with these wars\nNow the Qur'an and 48 laws, they polish my flaws\nI'm movin' niggas like puppets with no strings attached\nIt's nothin' for Beans, so you know it ain't a thing for Mack\nTo look in your eyes, see through your heart, know what you fearin'\nPick you apart, like you niggas is transparent\n(I see right through you niggas)\nIt's like Mack was born with advanced parents\nI'm like the Sun shinin' at night\nImagine it dog, I know you wanna see me gradually fall\nBut I'm walkin' on air, breakin' every gravity law\nIt's nothin' like it, I swear\nI spit words that skip through air\nLet the words of a true thug hit your ear\nIt change colors like blue blood when it hit the air\nIt's nothin' like it\n\n[Interlude]\nGoddamn, shit, I can't explain it\nFuck y'all niggas\n\n[Verse 3]\nI changed my whole life in about 9 months, just like sperm in a womb\nThese young niggas never learn 'til they doomed\nTry to tell them \"you can burn young punk without smellin' the fumes\"\nMake you shiver in the middle of June\nPaint a picture so vivid, you can hang it up in your room\nShine bright like a prism, displayin' colors like Crayola\nThink of the prisons with straight soldiers\nThink about the niggas who fucked us and played over us\nThink about the mothers who suffered and prayed over us\nJust look at the the picture I'm paintin', it's so perfect\nOpen your eyes motherfuckers, you can't duck us\nNo survivors every soul shall suffer\nI'm loadin' up revolvers every shell shall touch ya\nI promise it's like jihad with these mags, I'ma bust ya\n\n[Outro]\nGoddamn it's nothin' like it, I'm serious\nCan't explain how I write it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf8c5034f8552cd568d53398bc41222f.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2001-06-26", "title": "Nothing Like It", "album": "The Reason"}]}
