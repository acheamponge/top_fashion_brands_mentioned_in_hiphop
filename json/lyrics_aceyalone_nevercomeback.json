{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Aceyalone]\nDidn't you tell me it was all about you\nTo love respect you is all I gotta do\nDisconnect you is somethin that I never thought\nHow can we learn, from a lesson that was never taught\nMan I had so many plans for us\nI was hopin that you could save the last dance for us\nI never ever leave you in the sandy dust\nBut trust me, baby I'm the man to trust\nI won't call you up, I won't act a fool\nOr bring drama to your party, baby that ain't cool\nEveryone knows if you snooze you lose\nI'm just tryin to figure out if you heard the news\nLivin your life is at an all-time high\nDon't know why but I think I want that\nIt ain't cracked up to what it's 'posed to be\nAnd I can love you to death but I'll never come back\n\n[Hook]\nI can love you to death but I'll never come back\nI'll never come back, I'll never come back\nI can love you to death but I'll never come back\nTo see how love was, and how it does us\nI can love you to death but I'll never come back\nNever come back, I'mma never come back\nI'mma love you to death but I'll never come back\n\n[Aceyalone]\nWhat do I gotta do to let you know\nIt's harder and harder for me to just let go\nI'd rather be lonely than just live low\nPullin somebody's strings, I don't think so\nWhat do I look like, caught up in some feud\nHo if you wanna build I got brain food\nKnow I'll do anything to get you in the mood\nBut sellin myself sho't, I ain't that dude\nWonder what it'd cost to buy your dreams\nOpen you up so you could try new things\nThey call me the candy man, but you ice cream\nSpeadin my love girl, you're under my wings\nOne of these days I'mma just go home\nAnd follow that flow to the end of the track\nWorld ain't free as it's supposed to be\nAnd I can love you to death but I'll never come back\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Aceyalone]\nAin't it funny all the games they play\nGive you the green light, and take it all away\nShow me a good sign, I'll show you a star\nShow me who you love, I'll show you who you are\nHow many thin lines do we gotta cross\nTo find our way back or take it as a loss\nAll that glitter and gloss won't even cost\nSo how you gonna tell me how to do it when you're not the boss\nWho is the real you you don't even claim\nThe person inside me, that ain't near been the same\nFarmer will come, but she won't say her name\nComin to rescue us fears from the pain\nOne of these things that I got in my head\nYou made yo' bed, so lay where it's at\nI wish I had more than all of me to give\nAnd I can love you to death but I'll never come back\n\n[Final Hook]\nI can love you to death but I'll never come back\nI'll never come back, I said I'll never come back\nI can love you to death but I'll never come back\nTo see how love was, and how it does us\nI can love you to death but I'll never come back\nI'll never come back, I said I'll never come back~!\n...
