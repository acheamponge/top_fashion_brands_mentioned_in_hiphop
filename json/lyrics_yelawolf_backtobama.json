And I pull up with a whole flatbed\nThe baddest that you ever got from a crop, Yelawolf's got that cold flow from a old road, put a motherfucker down\nIn dixie wit' a verse that I pulled out from the soul, wanna come inside? Well really I got that lock n' load\n2,5,6 in the booth I spit, got a crew I'm with, from the roots of the old in Alabama\n\n[Outro:]\n\nTake my hand Dixie land, if you wanna rise, then I will stand\nHold my hand Dixie land I know your proud, I understaaaaaaand\n\n[Hook:]\n\nGoin' back to bama, gonna take it nice and slow\nGoin' back to bama, wanna see some open roads\nTake it easy Alabama and I watch my babies grow\n\nGoin' Back(4X)\nAlabama(4x)", "title": "Back To Bama"}]}
