Focusing on five wire-taps, the D.E.A., U.S. Immigration, and Mexican officials tracked Guzman down to this motel in Mazatlan, Mexico. It was a single wire-tap linking authorities directly to where Guzman was standing, room 401\n\n\"What is the key to your success?\"\n\"I basically say that the key to my success is striving for certain goals, you know, and reaching them without acknowledging them.\"", "title": "Po for President"}]}
