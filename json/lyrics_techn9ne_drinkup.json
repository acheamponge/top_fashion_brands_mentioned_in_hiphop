(Why?) Because it's their decision\nWhy they got the bottles and models around 'em thizzin'? (Why?)\nBecause they make a livin'\nWhy they starin' at us like all of 'em want a whippin'? (Why?)\nBecause them niggas trippin'\nWhy they gotta flex and be put into that position? (Why?)\n'Cause drunk is their condition\nMind toll, sleepin' is when I'm through\nThen it's never mind you, off the wine brew\nHard liquor, mixin', you wishin' for a thicken, that'll be a fine screw\nWakin' and perkin' off my medicine, shovin' mimosas up in my head again\nTell me to slow up, bitch I'm a veteran, I'ma get it bouncin'\nJust when they comin' at me with counselin'\nPlease sound the horn for this public announcement\n\n[Chorus]\nI ain't never givin' drink up\nI ain't never givin' drink up\nI ain't never givin' drink up\nJust fill my drink up\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhy they hatin' (Why?)\n'Cause we fuckin' amazin'\nWhy they lookin' at us with serious aggravation (Why?)\n'Cause they got limitations\nWhy they wanna scrap with us 'cause the money we makin' (Why?)\nThey got no education\nWhy they women leave' em to get with our congregation (Why?)\nBecause them niggas fake and we been awake\nAnd when this kid bite me, trippin', he did try me\nHad to crack 'em, had to get scrappy in this bizz naive\nI spin his hair right around, yes I did my G\nHe wanted to run up and get with the gun up because it was whizz by me\nDid your man 'cause she's a fan and hold my biz highly\nDoin' any and every to score like she is Kyrie\nIn a drunken stupor, she hit me with the kwizzz whyme\n'Cause we saw you can't handle liquor and hold a bwizz flylie\nYou bwi\n\n[Chorus]\nI ain't never givin' drink up\nI ain't never givin' drink up\nI ain't never givin' drink up\nJust fill my drink up\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhy we buzzin'? (Why?)\nBecause we steady chuggin'\nNow we leave the spot and we gotta go get to grubbin'? (Why?)\n'Cause we hungry all of a sudden\nWhy they get the table across the way hella muggin'? (Why?)\nBecause they think they thuggin'\nWhy y'all want the nook and not trippin' out over nothin'? (Why?)\nBecause I am McLovin\nGirl I'm tryna smash, so just hit the gas\nInebriated, we made it straight to the pad\nI know you probably heard that I am the bag\nI make hella cash and I do everything upper class\nBut what I'm 'bout to do is pour another glass\nGet a couple of Rice Crispy edibles out the stash (hold up)\nWe's about to have another blast\nGot up out of her clothes, ready to go and then I crashed (gone)\n\n[Outro]\nBut I ain't never givin' drink up\nDrink Aribou Cay respon... excessively\nI ain't never givin' drink up\nI ain't never givin' drink up\nLa la la la la"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
