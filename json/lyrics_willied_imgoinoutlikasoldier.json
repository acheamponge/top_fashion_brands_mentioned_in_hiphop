It's time to get paid\nYeah, fuck the bullshit\nAnd that nigga standing at the damn pulpit\nI left Charlie Brown on the cut\nCause I felt like Snoopy working for peanuts\nNow my ass is soe\nAnd I can't be fucked no mo'\nSo if you wanna test me, that'll hold ya\nI'm goin' out lika soldier...\n\nI'm goin' out lika S-O-L-D-I-E-R\nPumped up for an all out war\nSearching like a predator\nWith an M-16 looking for a magazine editor\nI know they don't write the columns\nBut they co-sign every volume\nSo I'm cutting off the head of state\nSo the rest of the body can't operate\nAnd while I'm into the slaughter\nI may as well bust a cap on a TV reporter\nAnd a DJ by the way\nFor giving that wicky wack shit radio play\nIf that's your preference so be it\nBut I'ma call it like I mothafucking see it\nAnd never be a pop chart trick\nY'all talk loud but you don't say shit\nI'd rather boycott that picture\nAnd rap about that which affects ya\nYou wonder why the cussing won't disappear\nGod damn, we ain't happy down here\nWillie D got problems\nSo when mom walk in, turn down the volume\nAnd act like you're doing your homework\nOr get your pussy or your dick knocked in the dirt\nThere's a vet in your vicinity\nSo pump up Ice Cube and jam Public Enemy\nAnd let the O.G. Ice-T kick a rhyme that'll mold ya\nAnd go out like a soldier...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/99c31136e48907dfc450b10677d10058.400x397x1.jpg", "album": "I\u2019m Goin\u2019 Out Lika Soldier", "title": "I\u2019m Goin\u2019 Out Lika Soldier"}]}
