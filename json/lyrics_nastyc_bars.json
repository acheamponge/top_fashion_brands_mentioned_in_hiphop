I think they need to confess\nThey all got in without it\nDamn hip-hop is a bitch, if she don't open up for me I'm picking locks in this bitch\nNow tell me have you seen her? Now the little nigga get real\nI'll let you beat your chest but we all know who really went gorillas\nMight be stacking peanuts, promise in years I'mma flip a mill up\nI don't settle for no simple jack like I was Ben Stiller\nI'mma do it for my fans and then myself and my moms too\nI go hard like the great James man, Lebron and Bons too\nThe young soldier wrote verses could've wrote Qurans too\nNow hoes throwing more likes in his direction than blinds do\nIf moms knew about the taxi war she wouldn't have died\nSo I ain't never tripping nigga and I ain't telling no lie\nNo-one to clean up after me as a child\nNow I got hip-hop all wet I wrapped a mop and stick that bitch in her thighs\nWithin a blink of an eye, All you rappers can get demolished\nYoung goblin, major attitude swag is a bit demonic\nI been watching y'all stunt and watching y'all front\nGot me pissed like Roby time your asses get up out the closet\nY'all peace wanting ah hip hop isn't really nothing to do, do\nI'm the shit but I won't settle for number two\nAnd I'm supposed to be locked up in a zoo somewhere\nGrip hold of the lock like its a deuce in the air\nGo hard as Pac, Papoose and BIG\nNo virgin escaped I do young man what it do young man?\nI go hard as a beast, let's twist the flow they caught up my feet\nYou know I'm just throwing the dot at the feet\nI called it a target you called it a night and you called it defeat\nMan who harder than me, I'm what you are this envy\nHow many dead rappers in my basement now? More than many\n\n[Outro]\nThey used to never wanna hear us,remember?\nNow these bad bitches over here tryna give a nigga head trust\nI'm better than the lame niggas tryin' to be famous\nCan't blame us"}], "artist": "Nasty C"}
