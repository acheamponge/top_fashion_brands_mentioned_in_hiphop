The shame rings true\nSeems to me reparations are overdue\nI done been to the top, I done sipped the juice\nAnd with that being said, bird crumbs'll never do\nEven on my last, not a penny in the bank\nI'ma stand on my own, so thanks, but no thanks\nKeep the pranks as I bid farewell\nI gotta answer to Marcus and Jennelle\nAnd to little brother Terrence who I love dearly so\nIf ever I had millions, never would you push blow, never\n\n[Chorus]\nWe got it for cheap\n\n[Interlude: Mr. Lee]\nAy, dios m\u00edo! Malicioso!\nThe handcuffs are off now Daddy\nEntiende! Cabroncito\nEveryone must pay now!\nBunch of mama huevos, toditos\nRe-Up Gang Records\nIt's your game now, daddy\n\n[Verse 3:  Pusha T]\nI'm the best since he died, and he lied\nThe spirit of competition, one verse could start jihad\nCPR Pusha, the flow tends to revive\nPullin the covers back, I expose what you disguise\nMy presence is felt, the pressure is on\nA 4'11\" Cuban helped us weather the storm\nPyrex and powder, it was back to the norm\nThrough all the adversity, the fury was born\n\n[Verse 4: Malice]\nNiggas don't get the picture, it's written in scripture\nEven ask your mama, she'll tell you that blood's thicker\nAnd I don't know how them other niggas built\nAnd I don't know if ever they feel guilt\nOr maybe niggas just too high on they stilts\nBut this one's on me, I'ma view it as spilt milk\nGrandma, look at me, I'm turnin the other cheek\nIt's the R-E-U-P G-A-N-G\n\n[Chorus]\nWe got it for cheap\n\n[Outro: Mr. Lee]\nFrom the street to this m\u00fasica\nWe get this money, we never stop\nRecord sales? Digital scales? It's whatever\nWe always at home\nHell Hath No Fury\nEl sue\u00f1o de un jodedor tratando de realizarlo\nMr. Lee!"}], "artist": "Clipse"}
