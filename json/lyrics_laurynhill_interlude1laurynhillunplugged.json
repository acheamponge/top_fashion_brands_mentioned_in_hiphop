Every single one of these songs, um, is about me first. Me first, um, it was like, you know, there was a period of time where I was just out, you know, just, just gone from the public, and, uh, I came to terms with the fact that... I had created this, uh, public persona, this public illusion.\n\nAnd it became, it, uh, it helped me hostage; like I couldn't be a real person because you're too afraid of, you know, what your, your public will say.\n\nAnd at that point I had to do some dying and really accept the fact that, look, \"this is who I am, and I have to be who I am, and all of us have a right to be who we are, and whenever we submit our will, because our will is a gift, it is given to us, so whenever we submit our will to someone else's opinion, you know, I mean, a part of us dies.\"\n\nYou know, and so it's been, um... it's been, it actually hasn't been a long time. It feels like a long time, but it hasn't been a long time. Some miraculous things have happened in a short amount of time, and uh, I'm just very blessed to be able to be here today and get to share with you some of the things I've learned.\n\nI know some of it sounds almost cryptic and I been really just, just really... waiting for the patience and really just articulate where I'm coming from as simply as possible, so I'm working on that.\n\nBut um... you know, I know, that you know that there's, uh... you know that I know that God doesn't lie and I know that he knows how to talk to the hearts of people better than anybody else, so I don't worry about that, cause whatever he relates to whomever is listening, that's what supposed to be understood at that time, so it's all good.\n\nBut, um, this is a song called \"Oh Jerusalem\"."}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
