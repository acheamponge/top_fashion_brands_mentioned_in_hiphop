Got a tool barrel\nOoh shit, Who is, ring leader he be the coolest\nBlue wrist, fool and one of them newest\nEast, West side or cold got niggas on either coast\nGotta oh gotta throw, then I'm out adios\nGot a hotter flow than most of these monotone MC'S\nSimply can't compare to him, PLEASE\nGet a breathe in, just breathe\nSpotlight pop life I'm the next thing\nY-Y-YEAH!!!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou know what they sayin?\nThey like, Black came to bring the pain\nHardcore when he aim, ya dead like a corpse in the grave\nThoroughbred winner like the horse in a race\nHorsepower in the Porsche at ya babe\nMost foul with playettes, the sport that I played\nThis rap shit, now tell me who important in the game\nTake it all in the bank, goin through the lanes\nThat's how I feel, a player in my court is my stage\nLike a boxing match, I'm goin Ali\nThat's not a move, but you could call me the \"Lord of the Ring\"\nIn the game for the fortune and the fame\nEvery lines fire like a torch to the flame\nBring an arsenal with an arsonist\nRhymes hot like the end of the firearm wu=ith firehawk\nYEAH!!!\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Black Milk"}
