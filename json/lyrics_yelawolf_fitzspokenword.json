Pat, can I buy a Vial?\nNaw, she'd rather spend her time in bars while me and my brother lick peanut butter jars\nNo shoes, feet blacker than tar\nno rules, surprise' we aint worse than we are.\nSo foolish i used to wish upon a star, praying that she change.\nbut naw she'll stay the same.\nMy young mind not knowin' that the drug had already altered her brain.\n23 years in, shit that's enough to retire at most jobs. but not the streets.\nSee, once you enter you can't leave. its like bein' locked inside with no keys.\na piano with no keys.\nTook a while for me to believe that the shit was disease.\neatin' on the mind of those that are weak.\nbut you still find time to fault me, please..", "title": "Fitz\u2019 Spoken Word"}]}
