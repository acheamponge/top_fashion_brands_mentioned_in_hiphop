(How?) You as fake as it gets\nThem tables turned on yo ass, now watch how real this shit gets\nI had to teach her a lesson, I knew that bitch a finesser\nI didn't fold under pressure, I hid that work in my dresser\nMy hustle game was impressive\nUp in the hills, no reception, wallet ain't in a recession\nPray to the lord for these blessings\nRight now I'm swimming in checks\nI need all these bags, I don't need nothing lesser\nYou see me came up, you see my chain up\nI switched my game up, working on my anger\nI'm blowing these lames up, no I still ain't changed up (nope)\nNo I still ain't changed up\n\n[Chorus]\nEven 12 couldn't cuff me, I write my life in these bars\nThey be all up in they feelings, you know I ain't got no heart (never)\nFebruary on a bitch (yup), leave ya boyfriend scarred (scarred)\nI gave your ass all type of chances, but you couldn't play the part\nThat's why, I got no more no more no more love (no more love)\nI got no more no more no more love (I got no more love)\nI got no more no more no more love (I got no more love)\nI got no more no more no more love (no more love)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9a9aad1d603e579226342fc86cfe53eb.562x562x1.jpg", "year": "2018-09-18", "title": "No More Love", "album": "15"}]}
