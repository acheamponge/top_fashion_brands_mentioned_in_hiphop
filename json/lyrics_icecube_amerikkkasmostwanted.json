Saw my face on TV\nDamn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out\nStruck out, I gotta get the fuck out\nPacked my bags and tried to hit the door when\nThe ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in\nCos the feds was out there ten deep\nI got hassled and gaffled in the back seat\nI think back when I was robbin' my own kind\nThe police didn't pay it no mind\nBut when I start robbing the white folks\nNow I'm in the pen with the soap-on-a-rope\nI said it before and I'll still taught it\nEvery motherfucker with a color is most wanted\n\n[Outro]\nAmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, uh,  reports that Ice Cube is the leader of the, uh, Lench Mob.
