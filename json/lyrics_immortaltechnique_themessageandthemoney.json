The fuck is that?\nNiggas need to start playing their position, man\nJust cause you throw a party, a hosting event, or an open mic or a showcase, or a battle\nThat don't make you important at all\nWithout me and everybody like me out there\nYou ain't nutting but a good idea, motherfucker\nSo stay in your place\n\nAnd to all these bitchass A&Rs who are too lazy to come up with a way to sell records..\nThat they keep recycling marketing schemes and imagery\nC'mon..\nThere is a market for everything man\nThere is a market for pet psychologists nigga. There is a market for twisted\nShitfetish video's. For nipplerings, for riverdancing, for chocolate covered roaches..\nBut you can't find one for cultured hardcore reality and hip-hop?\nPeople like you: the house nigga executives\nAnd them rich motherfuckers that own you; you the motherfucking machine man!\nYou and all these niggas talking about the same shit\nWith the same flow over the same candy-ass beats\nBut I refuse the feed the machine\nAnd Im not giving any magazine money\nSo maybe my album won't get 5 mics, or double-x-l's, or 5 discs\nWhatever man, fuck it\nBut then again; you don't own me, and none of you niggas ever will\nIf I'm feeling what you fight for I'm rolling with you to the end\nBut if not, then FUCK YOU!\nAnd the more that mc's, producers, dj's\nAnd independent labels start to grasp the conceptuality\nOf what their contribution to the business of hiphop is\nRather then just the music - the more the industry will be forced to change\n\nOh , heh, and one last thing;\n\nYou don't have to agree with everything I've said\nBut don't ever be condescending to me\nPicking up your wack ass friends that rhyme and being like\n'Ow yeah, Immortal Technique - he's aaiight'\nNo nigga..\nYour mom is pussy, that's aaiight, ok..\nYour peoples getting shot dead in the street, that's aaiight\nI'm the motherfucking Immortal Technique nigga! The message and the money!\nAnd you ain't got either!\nRemember that!\nPunk ass motherfucker..", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c628c98f9d53f039b060e7f0369c15b4.220x220x1.jpg", "album": "Revolutionary Vol. 2", "year": "2003-11-18"}]}
