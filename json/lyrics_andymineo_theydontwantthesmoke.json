You crazy?\"\nWe was just out in Malibu\nDSTL with the alley-oop, threw it up, man, I had to do it (Alley-oop!)\nI hope this next bar is so valuable\nYou wanna change your situation first, then it changes your attitude (Wow!)\nI dropped a project of B-sides and throwaways\nAnd still skated on 'em like roller blades\nWent from growin' pains to borin' planes to blowin' up sets\nYou show gains when you show up and you throwin' up reps\nWho throwin' subliminals?\nWell, have you broken your head?\nYou could take a picture with missiles, still ain't posin' a threat\nI hope you slow to forget, I never trolled to get lit\nI just came with flows, broke molds, and moulded a niche\nI gave jobs to my bros and still got more in the clip\nSometimes you gotta let 'em know who you is\nAndy Mineo"}]}
