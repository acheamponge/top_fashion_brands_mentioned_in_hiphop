Old Earth fell to her knees\nPolished the shoes, I got the suit dry cleaned\nFamily tight-lipped, but I heard it was lean\nWig flipped when I seen his daughter's seventeen\nSad shit, but if we bein' real\nYour dad was a prick\nLie, cheat, steal\nAnything from him, best double check on your own scale\nRumors were he snitched\nDepends who you believe\nEither way, that's two bits you can take or leave\nInstead, mumble something about space and grieve\nAll I can muster, old hustler tired of the hustle\nGoing out like Iverson chuckling\nBrick after brick, rip guitar lick\nThe box cutter went, then he dipped\nJill sprung Jack out on bail\nThen they skipped through strawberry fields\nWore it out, two days straight up in the motel\nThen he left while she slept\nMoney out the purse\nIt's an old story, I just changed a couple words\n\nYou don\u2019t matter at all (yah yah yah)\nYou don\u2019t matter at all (yah yah yah)\nYou don\u2019t matter at all (yah yah yah)\nYou don\u2019t matter at all (yah yah yah)\nYou don\u2019t matter at all (yah yah yah)\nYou don\u2019t matter at all (you don't matter at all)\nYou don\u2019t matter at all (you don't matter at all)\nYou don\u2019t matter at all (you don't matter at all)\n\n\n[Verse 2: Euclid]\nShe barkin' the highest damp iris\nRushing out in the flesh self-righteous\nNew breath, same old missteps trodden\n[? 2:33 Curve the ex while] you wanna do me grinding\nTime canceled out in dream\nBlack yakky rhyme weave, HD full screen\nSide piece, peat leak, coconut cream\nOcean aquatic, back in the pocket\nDove leaves\nAt the core, rotten\nSomethings all talking shit at the club\nGrips tighter, straw man in the mire\n[? 2:51 Bleed through ira]\nEyes up, Spun the wheel of life\nWant the knife before my yarn's cut (eyes up)\nI want the knife\n\n[Verse 3: Henry Canyons]\nNo way, no way\nNo way, no way\nCan\u2019t put the blame on me\nShame on you\nAnd you lost face and it seemed so strange\nNo wonder you never been the same\n\nNo way, no way\nNo way, no way\nCan\u2019t put the blame on me\nShame on you\nAnd you lost face and it seemed so strange\nNo wonder you never been the same\n\nStory night late December\nFate of a friendship surrendered\nHeard it through the hallway\n\"Dad can I crash at [? 3:33 Onray's?]\"\nHe took long to respond\n\"Come on\", \"Now don\u2019t start\nPromise me no drinks, no drugs, and no pot\"\nCommerce what we got, car for a start\nHit the park for the onslaught\nHopped the wall of Montgomery\nNever thought my best friend would become poor company\nRolled up, oh fuck, yo, steam the leaf it\u2019s an old dutch took a puff\nPerfectly salvaged smoke rising, Deciding the night\u2019s tactic\nHit the two to the one and he\u2019s got a free crib Franklin and Varick? Dope\nOpen the door circle of seven chicks playing through the [? 4:01 day]\nMad blow mad drinks all sitting on the floor\nSwooped in sat down\nHit the coke like snow plow\nSlam three shots leaned over told him slow down\n'bout an hour later, hit the ground face blue face down\nWhat to do, who to call, and to say how\nEMT and his dad on their way now\nThank God that he came out -- unscathed\nI'll forever remember that shakedown (I'll forever remember that shakedown)\n\nNo way, no way\nNo way, no way\nCan\u2019t put the blame on me\nShame on you\nAnd you lost face and it seemed so strange"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
