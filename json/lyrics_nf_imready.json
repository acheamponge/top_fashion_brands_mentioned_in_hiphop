Then you can listen and watch\nYou ain't in peace with it? How do you envision the plot?\nI've taken everything I love and makin' it rock\nYou see, my mind doesn't work like your's does\nWhen I fall down, I just stand up more tough\nAnd I'm not afraid to die, I don't care if the war comes\nTo my front door, see I just open the door up\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm ready\nI'm ready\nI'm ready\nI'm ready\n\n[Outro]\nI'm ready\nThey won't break me\u2014I might fall, but that won't change me\nI'm ready\nAnd you might pull me and take your shots, but you won't move me\nI'm ready\nThey won't break me\u2014I might fall, but that won't change me\nI'm ready\nAnd you might pull me and take your shots, but you won't move me"}], "artist": "NF"}
