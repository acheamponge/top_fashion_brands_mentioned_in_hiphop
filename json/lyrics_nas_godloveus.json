speak without thinkin'..\nSpeak without speakin'.. huh..\nFeel without reachin', uhh\nThat's what it's about\nIt's about that, inner, inner love, yaknahmean?\n\n[Chorus]\nGod love us hood niggas (I know)\n'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)\nAnd the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)\n'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh\nAnd I know he feel us, uhh\nGod love us hood niggas (I know)\n'Cause he be with us in the prisons\nAnd he takes time to listen, uhh\nGod love us hood niggas (I know)\n'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh\nBut he forgive us\n\n[Verse 1]\nHe who has ears, let him hear\nAnd he who has sight, let him see\nHe who has life, let him be\nSee everything goes through change\nThose who know don't talk\nAnd those who talk don't know a thing\nMen are born soft and turn tough\nDead lay a stiffened heart, I've been kissed by God\nI've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart\nBy the beast but he missed his mark\nAlone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up\nWhen I saw my body on the floor, from above I watch it all\nYo it came to me, the pain in me\nMany slain empty skulls where a brain should be\nIt strangely seemed, like it was a dream\nBut the si-rens had never woke me\nOnly reason I'm here now is 'cause God chose me\nAnd to me, I'm only just a crook nigga\nBut God love us hood niggas\n\n[Chorus]\nGod love us hood niggas (I know)\n'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)\nAnd the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)\n'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh\nAnd I know he feel us, uhh\nGod love us hood niggas (I know)\n'Cause he be with us in the prisons\nAnd he takes time to listen, uhh\nGod love us hood niggas (I know)\n'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh\nBut he forgive us\n\n[Verse 2]\nDay by day by day I sit back and pray\nMy thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage\nThey pass away, they went off the casket way\nMy gats will spray, but that won't bring 'em back today\nSo long my crimes now gone for eternity\nThe team we got left on the set, now turn to me\nCan't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind\nI ride past the church where they got his body and find\nThey takin' him to the hearse to put his body in dirt\nThat's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt\nNow it's time to do work, out of love and retribution\nAs loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses\nLoadin' clips up, countin' bullets carefully\nFor self, though it feels like, he was there for me\nSaw the enemy, I ate him, saw Jakes behind me\nThey ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin' me\n\n[Chorus]\nGod love us hood niggas (I know)\n'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)\nAnd the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)\n'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh\nAnd I know he feel us, uhh\nGod love us hood niggas (I know)\n'Cause he be with us in the prisons\nAnd he takes time to listen, uhh\nGod love us hood niggas (I know)\n'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh\nBut he forgive us\n\n[Verse 3]\nJealousy in the hood, felonies in the hood\nThugs with guns become celebrities in the hood\nYo it's beef in the hood, smoke trees in the hood\nLittle girls have seeds by OGs in the hood\nIt's food in the hood, it's drugs in the hood\nYou can choose if you would, coke to sniff\nDope to ooze in your blood, parolees\nEx-cons live in the hood, it's jobs in the hood\nYou can starve in the hood\nYour best friends'll fuck your baby moms in the hood\nBut it's good in the hood, I was raised in the hood\nWas taught how to walk and duck strays in the hood\nI stays in the hood, got my ways from the hood\nLearned to play ball go to the NBA, in the hood\nThere's AIDS (uh), in the hood (WHAT?)\nOur lives are the worst, on top of that, we broke\nThat's the main reason why God, love us the most\n\n[Chorus]\nGod love us hood niggas (I know)\n'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)\nAnd the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)\n'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh\nAnd I know he feel us, uhh\nGod love us hood niggas (I know)\n'Cause he be with us in the prisons\nAnd he takes time to listen, uhh\nGod love us hood niggas (I know)\n'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh\nBut he forgive us\nGod love us hood niggas (I know)\n'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)\nAnd the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)\n'Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh\nAnd I know he feel us, uhh\nGod love us hood niggas (I know)\n'Cause he be with us in the prisons\nAnd he takes time to listen, uhh\nGod love us hood niggas (I know)\n'Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas\nBut he forgive us, uhh"}], "artist": "Nas"}
