I rep\nAnd it still ain't enough for the haters\nPut on for my city, light it up like it's Vegas\nHow you frontin' on, Ali, I'm the greatest\nFloat like a butterfly , the Porsche ride amazing\nI feel like Speedracer\nMargielas in the Louis Duffle\nMCM hold the Fendi buckle\nPaw, that's what I call an interracial couple\nAlong with poppin' sounds ,that's a power struggle\n\n[Hook: Iggy Azalea]\nPut everything in a suitcase one day\nAnd run away to the runway\nTo find somewhere to lay my heart (lay my heart)\nIf you see me rollin' that's where I'm going\nTo find somewhere to lay my heart\nHome's wherever I lay my heart\n\n[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]\nChange my longitude, and my latitude\nTo get an attitude that shit gratitude\nBut my mind's gone until I find home\nThen I can get my shine on, no rhinestones\nThen I can get my shine on, no rhinestones\nSee you later with my bags, I'm gone\n\n[Hook: Iggy Azalea]\nPut everything in a suitcase one day\nAnd run away to the runway\nTo find somewhere to lay my heart (lay my heart)\nIf you see me rollin' that's where I'm going\nTo find somewhere to lay my heart\nHome's wherever I lay my heart", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4049551c786a5687d6d0190a8a138940.475x475x1.jpg", "album": "Glory - EP", "year": null}]}
