Man life unfair\nHe be feelin' like fuck the world and furthermore\nFeelin' like it's worth\nKillin' a person for\nBut when that pain's gone, it just hurts some more\nIt seems the sun never shine, that we searchin' for\n\n[Chorus]\nYou might think you do\nBut you don't know\nIt's like a dream come true\nBut you don't know\nYou might think you do\nBut you don't know\nIt's like a dream come true\nBut you don't know"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
