I ain't study in the bad man trends but a bad man asks you a why you [?]\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bridge]\n\n[Verse 3: Kardinal Offishall]\nI hear them talk, I hear them talk\nI ain't really studying how waste man walk\nLoading up the clip because I need another shot\nBlack cat, 9 lives, one love, 2Pac\nBiggie lookin' down tryna see who in his spot\nYou can hear him laughing with Jesus on the block\nYou selling you soul trying to make another knot\nYou the man right now but you temporary hot\nFire works bust when the squad gets working'\nChicks spend money when the broads get twerkin'\nRude boy Kardinal still the same person\nPower to the people till jock close the curtains\n\n[Chorus]\n(Raybans on and I'm lurking)\n\n[Bridge]"}], "artist": "Kardinal Offishall"}
