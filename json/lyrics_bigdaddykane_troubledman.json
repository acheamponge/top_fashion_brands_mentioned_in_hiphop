Yeah, I bet!\"\nSo when I see 'em on the solo tip\nI gotta throw joints to prove my point\nJust when I thought that I had the neighborhood support\nHere comes another battle to be fought, huh\nYou know they even tried to start a AIDS rumor\nDiggin' the kind of life, that would maybe doom a\nBrother of my priniciple, you'd think some of these people\nWould be more sensible, because a lie like that\nDidn't bring my sex flow to an end\nMaaaaaaaan, I'm still gettin' skins!\nAnd the beat goes on until the thrill is gone\nAnd life is the same old song\nAnd maybe one day you can understand\nWhat it's like to be a troubled man\n\n[Hook]\n\"I got so much trouble on my mind\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f2f313ca094b7792e9d4a77d69784d4d.475x473x1.jpg", "year": null, "title": "Troubled Man", "album": "Prince of Darkness"}]}
