I know I do\nI know I wanna get my songs on iTunes then see the world\nThen write new music that feeds the world\nI\u2019m not black enough to go back to Africa; fast enough\nDecaffeinated on the grounds of a massacre\nIt\u2019s like that for real\nNightcap, right back to my record deal\nI wanna help people, I wanna be rich\nI wanna be the Bob Marley of this rap music\n\n[Verse 2: Noname]\nMy whole-hearted melody, lost in amphetamines\nTrapped in a box, I was drinking more Kerosene\nBelieve the reason why breathing is so appeasing\nI met the angel of death in the breath of a gothic Eden\nYou not hearing this, you not Dilated Peoples\nAnd a hand-etched to god like a lyricist, hear me roar\nMetaphor, hypocrite, dear me lord, steer me 'fore I fly again\nDie within, lie with him\nOn a top notch bed of locusts\nI\u2019m ready to make good on a bed with the roses\nOh this is life, empty bank account and a kitchen knife\nI quit the weed, I had to leave a friend in need\nIt\u2019s been 30 days since she looked at me\n\n[Bridge: Noname]\nAnd I\u2019m sorry\nGood things come\nGood things come to an end\nGood things come to an end\nGood things come to an end\nSometimes\nGood things come\nGood things come\n\n[Hook: Queen SheCago]\nTony the tiger told me not to lie\nI\u2019m brain dead, I\u2019m too high\nI drifted to the other side of\nBlue and white of paradise, of paradise"}], "artist": "Noname"}
