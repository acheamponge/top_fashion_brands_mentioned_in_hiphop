Patience always\ntipping, tipping, to and fro.\nDancing magnesium in the light of the flame.\nStanding hot hearted,\nbut always boiling to the heat of it's own drum.\nIt is the sum of my living.\nAnd I've just been trying to find my way.\n\nStillness.\nI feel like a secret I've never told.\nTucked tightly between the sheets of my conscience.\nWords cannot be held.\nHands constantly reaching out for empty.\nHearts racing toward a bearing paradise.\nLove longing, but never lasted.\nWhy can't you let go?\nGhostly habits.\n\nIn a perfect world I would be a thunderstorm.\nRain falling everywhere at once,\nlike big diamonds on my skin melting into reverie.\nLightly making itself present,\ncolor bowing beneath the clouds,\nbeing affected, being transposed.\n\nA heavy set of hands on the hills of my body,\nholding its shape together.\nClothing the fears.\nKeeping these lens from falling to pieces.\nWhen the sky breaks apart, and the weight culminates,\nwill my fingers nail the buzzing of blood\nand the absence of numbness?\nCan I keep the door open and the lights on in the forest?\nWill the trees still call me home again?", "year": "2017-03-13"}]}
