Everybody told me to fall back\nCause what I'm dealin' with is all bad\nFortunate for you, I don't listen to none of my peers\nSo all that really great advice was fallin' on dead ears\nI mean, you're everything I wanted: mentally and physically\nThe only thing I hated was your history. You gettin' me?\nCouldn't take the walls down your exes made you put up\nHope some day you learn when to put your foot down and lift your foot up", "year": "2010-07-13", "album": null}], "artist": "Ace Hashimoto"}
