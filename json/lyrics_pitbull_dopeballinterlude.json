We waste a blow\nIf it's all 3, then that's the 3 from the top of the key, before you cup a brick, scrape some grams off the top of the key\nSame for the blow, we call those free throws, they call 'm' cheerleaders, we call 'm cheap hoes\nFind some low ones, have them beg a few O's\nNext thing you know your puttin' numbers on the boat\nThe whole point is to stay on the courts, but in this game the whole point is to stay outta courts\nYeah they similar, but not the same sports\nBoth international, import, export\nExtort and if you get caught, the law is like referee, it can get bought\nExtort and if you get caught, the law is like referee, it can get bought\n\nDope Ball, Dope Ball, we play, we play, we playin' Dope Ball, Dope Ball\nThis is called what? Dope Ball, Dope Ball!\nI know y'all later, if you push weighter, you see a Dope Ball~!", "year": "2009-08-28"}]}
