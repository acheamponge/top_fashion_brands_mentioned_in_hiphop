Yeah Tairrie B!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow let\u2019s hear it for my sisters who had something to say\nThe ladies who spit legit from back in the day\nSmashing stereotypes and breaking down doors\nPushing boundaries and waxing poetic on the dance floors\nNot dropping drawers like whores on all fours\nSetting women back for years after all that we\u2019ve fought for\nWhatever happened to the bad ass chicks?\nNow everybody\u2019s videos are porn flicks!\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s nothing wrong with a nice ass\nBut put some clothes on and leave some mystery for fans\nDamn, that shit\u2019s weak and reeks of weak minds\nWho got nothing to say so they just show their behinds\nI grind rhymes and flow my linguistics\nMyself not a mimic, so no need for those gimmicks\nAnd that might come as a disturbance to cynics\nBut my resurgence is urgent so middle finger to critics\nI never quit it, just took a sabbatical for my soul\nTurned my words into sigils so magical to behold\nBringin\u2019 the cold to the mic like an ice queen\nBut I can make it melt motherfucker, if I scream\n\n[Chorus]\n(She was gonna be a real fiesty dynamo)\n(And create electricity wherever she went)\n(Tairrie B!)\n(Bitch virtuosity!)\n(Putting more fuel on the fire)\n(I would love to hear more female opinions with regards to this topic)\n\n[Verse 3]\nStrike a pose and the Hollywood sign lights up\nSo leave your Gods and your politics home cause I don\u2019t give a fuck\nI rep the city that I love the most\nAnd when the sun sets low on the West Coast\nI shine cause I\u2019m nobody\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9\nWrite my own rhymes, won\u2019t apologize for what I say\nIn a business that thrives on lies\nNobody gave me a free ride but I still survived\nAnd there was hell to pay so I paid dues\nI took my lumps and I gave a few too\nSo don\u2019t believe everything you read\nThe internet's full of bullshit and those who feed\nOff the negativity like a vulture\nAnd they\u2019ll bleed you dry in this comment culture\nThe need to be famous gave us pop\nAnd watered down Hip-Hop with a booty on top\nPlease stop tryna get that attention\nBecause it\u2019s a movement, don\u2019t mean it's progression\nMy self-expression is progressing with age\nBut I can still remember when women had rage\nOriginality that wasn\u2019t easy to bluff\nAnd now all I see is just image and fluff\nBut \u201cIf It Ain\u2019t Ruff\u201d then I\u2019mma say \u201cdamn bitch\u201d\nSo listen up! Do I speak a dead language?\nCause I\u2019m a bad witch like Jessica Lange is\nAnd I ain\u2019t here to be cute, I do damage!"}], "artist": "Tairrie B"}
