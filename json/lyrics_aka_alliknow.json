There you go again\"\nThat's why I'm in a club on my fucking BBM\nThat's why I'm never trusted when I'm in DBN\nWe work it out then we go right back to the begin\n\n[Hook]\n\nVerse 2:\nI need a paradigm shift on a double\nA paradise somewhere in my mind I can run to\nI, once upon a time you and I was a couple\nBut now you turn to ice everytime I try touch you\nWish I could press rewind, on every single line\nWhen I was kicking it with different bitches every night\nThey say that love is blind, you see that camera clickin' in my eyes\nNow everytime I need to go you need to pick a fight\nI be leaving for domestic\nSee me by the exit, Jesus on my necklace\nThe evil's on my guest list\nYes, this is the path I chose, cut deeper than the pieces of the hearts I broke\nAnd she gon be like \"Why we go through this every week?\nYou taking all my energy I need a new release\"\nThat's why we best enemies when I'm in CPT\nWe work it out then we turn in 180 degrees\n\n[Hook]\n\nVerse 3:\nWe thought this love was ever green\nYou told me that my loving would be all you ever need\nLucky for you, it's the last time I ever leave\nI'd rather die on my feet than try to live on my knees\nThe party scene tore us apart\nSo many new beginnings I don't know where to start\nSometimes I wonder if you think about me at all\nShit all you gotta do is turn that radio on (Let's Go)\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2011-08-26", "album": "Altar Ego", "image": "https://images.genius.com/04dba2cb161f7bd426cc0ca9e52a2d54.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "AKA"}
