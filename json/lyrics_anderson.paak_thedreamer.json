It ain't no magic, ain't no Copperfield\nMore like a panther, Huey Newton, Bobby Seale\nWord to the free lunch. Who knew what we would become?\nWho would be defunct? Which rumours would be debunked?\nYeah, this is the music that you gotta feel\nYeah, gave you the truth before I got a deal\nNo rabbit in a hat. It ain't no magic, ain't no Copperfield\nMore like a panther, Huey Newton, Bobby Seale\nWord to the free lunch. Who knew what we would become?\nWho would be defunct? Which rumours would be debunked?\n\n[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]\nUsed to be scared of all my fears\nTill I woke up from this nightmare\nNow what become of a dream deferred, now until we leave this earth\nThe music make your speakers burst, I always put my people first\nIt's deep how when I speak they say I'm preaching like I lead a church\nNo proper opposition, competition gonna need a nurse\nMy job as an artist is making miracles\nTo show you how to struggle poetic and make it lyrical\nCrystallize the thought to make it clear to you\nAnd make the revolution irresistable\n\n[Chorus 1: Anderson .Paak]\nThis one's for all the little dreamers\nAnd the ones who never gave a fuck\nI'm a product of the tube and the free lunch\nLiving room, watching old reruns\nAnd who cares your daddy couldn't be here?\nMama always kept the cable on\nI'm a product of the tube and the free lunch\nLiving room, watching old reruns\n\n[Interlude: Timan Family Choir]\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\nDon't stop now, keep dreaming\n\n[Outro]\nOh my gosh guys calm down\nStop it\n\n[Skit]\nNow evolution: Where it all going? Is it coming to an end or it it just beginning\nThere was one fellow who know'd Malibu quite well at a certain time in history\nAnd I doubt if very few people are able to find these types of conditions again\nDue to crowds and controls and much bureaucracy\nBut there are other areas which are magnificent, treasures of this world\nAnd for somebody with adventure and excitement in their lives, and they have a lot of excitement and adventure\nThey can find this way of living"}]}
