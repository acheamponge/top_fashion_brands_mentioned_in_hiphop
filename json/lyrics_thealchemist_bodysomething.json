Cypress Hill, Soul Assassins, uh\n\nAs the game gets older all you niggas get younger\nYou put your hand in my plate, go 'head and question my hunger\nI'll show you how the 6 spit a barrel of thunder\nShoot the math one round, put you six feet under\nPour the liquor out, for my homey who didn't make it\nWe hold your name up, and celebrate it, never be faded\nYou on the grind and sometimes shit boggles your mind\nHow you got away with the crimes and you prospered\nTook advantage, of every single thing life has to offer\nThugs never got nothin nice in the brain\nSee cold-blooded ass niggas swish ice in their veins\nYou blinded by the ice on the chains\nDivided by the price of the fame\nYou rollin like dice in the game\nIt's a gamble, too hot to handle\nGot to know when to hold 'em, fold 'em and then scramble\nMove quick, we blow your head out like a candle.. candle..\n\n[Hook: repeat 2X]\nY'all know I got the shotty pumpin\nSo you know I'm gonna body somethin\nGot the blood in your body pumpin\nBig guns that'll keep your party jumpin\n\n[B-Real]\nI get... more from the hustle\nI get... more money, more problems\nI get... all the look stoned people\nI get... pigs knockin on my door\nI get... hard times all over\nI get... bitches schemin on me\nI get... dough cash in a tight-ass grip\nI get you a casket bitch!", "title": "Body Something", "album": "The Chemistry Files"}], "artist": "The Alchemist"}
