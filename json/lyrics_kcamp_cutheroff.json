You know I'm the man ho\nNothing but a bird, I'ma leave you where you stand, ho\nHeard you got a man ho, hope he understand though\nYou ain't nothing but a creeper baby, I'm just saying though\nSaying though, aye, it ain't nothing to cut that bitch off\nIt ain't nothing to cut that bitch off\n\n[Verse 1 - K Camp]\nCreeping on the low, hope your man don't see\nShe will bust it down for some damn Lime-A-Ritas\nChew me like some bubblegum, something like Rasheeda\nGotta get my partner some, she on me like Adidas\nBaby, you can't hold back, better stop flexing like you not\nYour man tryna patrol then I guess he is a cop\nBut he really can't cuff if he busting at my spot\nBut I done had enough cause you making my shit hot\nBlowing up a nigga phone, what I tell yo ass 'bout that?\nTryna hold something, hold my nuts, can you do that?\nCan you play around with that mouth while he hit it from the back?\nYou can't say nothing now cause we all been through that, through that\n\n[Hook - K Camp]\nIt ain't nothing to cut that bitch off\nIt ain't nothing to cut that bitch off\nSo what you saying ho? You know I'm the man ho\nSo what you saying ho? You know I'm the man ho\n\n[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]\nYou know that ain't a real bag bitch, that's a knock off\nWhen I get that work I get to juggin' like hot sauce\nAll swimmin pool lakefront\nHit it from the back, rearrange her lace front\nStuntin', tattoos on my neck and on my kidney\nIf I don't like that ho I turn her ass into a frisbee\nIf I dont like your disc I turn that ho into a frisbee\nI throw it out on Old Nat right by the Wendy\u2019s\nThree cellphones and all of 'em jumpin'\nI can see your hoes and all em' nothing\nYeah I'm a don don', Don Cheadle, Don Cornelius\nWatch the Dom spill\nPockets fat as Don Cartagena, nigga, done deal!\n\n[Hook - K Camp]\nIt ain't nothing to cut that bitch off\nIt ain't nothing to cut that bitch off\nSo what you saying ho? You know I'm the man ho\nSo what you saying ho? You know I'm the man ho\n\n[Verse 3 - K Camp]\nBaby I'm ashamed, why you acting this way?\nHeard she 'bout that action, you can bring her this way\nHit her on yo mattress, make you feel some type of way\nPass her to my migos, they gonna bust it, \u00a1Andale!\nPlease don't play no games cause I know thats what you like\nKnock it out the frame, baby girl, it's alright\nYeah that pussy bomb, I just call it dynamite\nYou ready? Here I come, I can do this shit all night\n\n[Hook - K Camp]\nIt ain't nothing to cut that bitch off\nIt ain't nothing to cut that bitch off\nSo what you saying ho? You know I'm the man ho\nNothing but a bird, I'ma leave you where you stand, ho\nHeard you got a man ho, hope he understand though\nYou ain't nothing but a creeper baby, I'm just saying though\nSaying though, aye, it ain't nothing to cut that bitch off\nIt ain't nothing to cut that bitch off"}], "artist": "K CAMP"}
