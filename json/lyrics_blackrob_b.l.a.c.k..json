We about to take off\n\n[Hook]\n\nNow there's a rumor being spread about me and the team\nAnd a couple wild brothers outta 115\nY'all might not have heard it, some cat got murdered\nNow everybody walking around all shady nervous\nI ain't sweatin that, bout to do a show in San Antonio\n(Then what?), then fly back home\nI calls guy on the phone, they had a car at the airport\nSomethin with a chick chaffeur, butt naked in the full length fur\nIt's on and popping, work it baby ain't no stopping\nBad Boy is in the building, honeys catching feeling\nNow we rated number one, now, sales through the ceiling\nPeople had faith in Rob\nI'm on that and run the point like Jason [Kidd], god\nIt's one thing to be all hood\nI guess its safe to say, (what?), so far so good\nBlack\n\n[Hook]\n\nDowntown we winding down, last call for alcohol\nScoop up your girl\nYou've never seen this before, that's a Bentely Four\nFresh out the store, this should be against the law\nParty don't stop, can't stop, won't stop\nHit the bootlegger, pint of Rock\nAnd I'm a get smart through the hollerin\nLong as she doin less talkin and more swallowin\nNow Black is what they hollerin out in the east\nHow he won't go away like permanent crease\nAnd this is how I murder the streets\nA lotta dudes is mad when I'm just trying to get a bite to eat\nI dont care if yall just two-step to do the hustle\nThis is New York rapping, bring me some New York muscle\nSee me in the club, its nothin but love\nLove the way I position myself to rise above\nBlack\n\n[Hook]\n\nOne more time baby\n\n[Repeat Hook]"}], "artist": "Black Rob"}
