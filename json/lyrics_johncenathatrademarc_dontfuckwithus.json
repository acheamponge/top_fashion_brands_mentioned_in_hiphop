We're leavin you face down\nStompin bitch rappers like I'm straight outta A-Town\nRunnin the playground like it was a track meet\nShoes on the whip that be bigger than Shaq's feet\nWe into big things, bank account's overgrown\nAll types of cheese - swiss, cheddar, provolone\nGuaranteed to burn wax like candles\nTrack hittin hard to the head like shots of Jack Daniels\n\n[Hook 2X: John Cena]\nY'all, bitch, crews, don't wanna fuck with us\nY'all bound, to, lose, another one bites the dust\nY'all, bitch, crews, don't wanna fuck with us\nY'all bound, to, lose, another one bites the dust\n\n[Verse 2: Tha Trademarc]\nIt's Trademarc the truth, laid back, aloof\nI'm God, as if you needed some proof\nYou ain't hard I can see it on you, I need a roof\nFuck a droptop, crop if I'm creepin on you\nClick-clack nickelback knickknacks if you got heaters on you\nSpittin back live rounders, with five pounders\nIf we meetin on two, I put a beatin on you\nYour sound's tired buddy, that's why I'm sleepin on you\nWe lean back in the ride, with cream stackin the rawhide\nThe sound of God slide with a raw vibe\nStraight military camel clothes ash brown boots\nSo sick, I've been handlin flows, since enamel was gold tooth\nAnd branded by low\nYou cold fuck like eskimo hoes at 7 below\nYou slow, you be the last to think\nMy hands seen more fuckin dirt than bathroom sinks\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: John Cena]\nI got punks, dumps and switches, dump chumpses bitches\nWe feed you to the sharks, you can sleep with the fishes\nClean you like dishes but I ain't no busboy\nYou ain't family, you ain't earnin my trust boy\nSeen too many bitches that'll double cross ya\nWe bring more drama than the Laker roster\nGet the click pissed, ain't nobody can save ya\nThrow heat without lookin like Fernando Valenzuela\n\n[Verse 4: Tha Trademarc]\nMarc Predka's the name, the rest of you lame\nI'm ego drivin, seen with different women, every size and frame\nI refine my game by fuckin famous bitches\nBut it's all the same, it's just ex to the next\nFor sex or brain, misses or Mrs\nMarried or not, my game don't stop\nIt's cars bars bonds and stocks you ain't see my flow\nY'all are small-time suckers like a knee-high ho\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "John Cena & Tha Trademarc"}
