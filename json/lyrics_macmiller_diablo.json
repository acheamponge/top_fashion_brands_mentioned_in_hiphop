None of your fuckin' beeswax\nThese raps bring a joint together like a kneecap\nFuck the little 8 balls, show me where the ki's at\nThe time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish 'em\nTryna find a balance, reachin' from my equilibrium\nFools I pity 'em, I'm not a human\nI'm amphibian, fake superhero like the Mystery Men\nI ain't saving nothin'\nI'm gettin' faded 'til the angels come and skippin' all the famous functions\nHow do the famous function? The A list can't be trusted\nI strong-arm 'em like I play the trumpet\nThe bottom barrel of society, I tell my bitch\nIf she don't love me then just lie to me, I'm finer than the winery\nTake it from the rich, this is piracy (Piracy)\nFinally, I don't even need my fucking eyes to see\nCome and die with me\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause everybody got dead homies (On the dead homies)\nSaid everybody got dead homies (On the dead homies)\nYeah, said everybody got dead homies (On the dead homies)\nSaid everybody got dead homies (On the dead homies)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, um\nOkay, my mind is Yoda, I'm on Ayatollah\nThese other rappers just a diet soda\nI find Jehovah in the darkest places, empty as apartment basements\nThis a marathon gentlemen, go 'head and start the races\nSave the coffin spaces\nYou'll come up missin', tell your bitch that you been trippin' now you on vacation\nRappin' like it's automated, lights I keep 'em on like Vegas\nLava makin', so hot I'm turning hog to bacon\nOnly God can save 'im, I heard the monsters made 'im\nI ain't a star, I'm way farther with the constellations\nContemplatin' suicide like it's a DVD\nLost inside my mind, it's a prison, homie, leave me be\nYou can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks\nBitch, I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke\nGordon Bombay in these streets, ballin' like I'm Pistol Pete\nBeen a beast, every word I spit rewritin' history\nLook at what you did to me, look at what you did to me\nRunnin' to the underworld with guns and set the sinners free\nNo bitches in my circle, I'ma show you the commercial\nI've been popping like a kernel, readin' Justin Bieber's journal\nTreat you like a urinal\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause everybody got dead homies (On the dead homies)\nSaid everybody got dead homies (On the dead homies)\nYeah, said everybody got dead homies (On the dead homies)\nSaid everybody got dead homies (On the dead homies)", "year": "2014-02-09", "album": "Faces", "title": "Diablo"}], "artist": "Mac Miller"}
