I can't believe you bought that excuse!\nRockin' a motherfuckin' flag don't make you a hero\nWord to Ground Zero\nThe Devil crept into Heaven, God overslept on the seventh\nThe New World Order was born on September 11th\n\n[Hook]\nFather, forgive them, for they don't know right from wrong\nThe truth will set you free, written down in this song\nAnd the song has the Cause of Death written in code\nThe Word of God brought to life, that'll save your soul\nSave your soul, motherfucker, save your soul!\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd just so conservatives don't take it to heart\nI don't think Bush did it, 'cause he isn't that smart\nHe's just a stupid puppet takin' orders on his cell phone\nFrom the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone\nThe military industry got it poppin' and lockin'\nLookin' for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine\nAnd as a matter of fact, Rumsfeld, now that I think back\nWithout 9/11, you couldn't have a war in Iraq\nOr a defense budget of world conquest proportions\nKill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortion\nTax cut extortion, a blessing to the wealthy and wicked\nBut you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted\nAnd Dick Cheney, you fuckin' leech, tell them your plans\nAbout building your pipelines through Afghanistan\nAnd how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan\nYou might have some house niggas fooled, but I understand\nColonialism is sponsored by corporations\nThat's why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations\nTell me the truth, I don't scare into paralysis\nI know the CIA saw Bin Laden on dialysis\nIn '98 when he was top ten for the FBI\nGovernment ties is really why the government lies\nRead it yourself instead of askin' the government why\n'Cause then the cause of death'll cause the propaganda to die\n\n[Outro]\nHe is scheduled for sixty minutes next. He is going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People everywhere are starting to listen to him\u2014it's embarrassing!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c628c98f9d53f039b060e7f0369c15b4.220x220x1.jpg", "album": "Revolutionary Vol. 2", "year": "2003-11-18"}]}
