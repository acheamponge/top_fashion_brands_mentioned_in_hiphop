beef\nLate night city life, in the dark Manhattan fog, creep\nWit' cats and dogs become meat\nAll that is sacred\nMy body lay naked\nAching for some weeks, maybe it was a hostage taken\nSome money making Jamaican\nHigh for thuggery disgrace on did him ugly, kicked his bloody face in\nMaybe he was mistaken for some great man\nIn a dirty place he lay in a gray basement\nShaking his scabs, crack bag, stabbed up four times, strong!\nWith a long rusty Jason\nDumped the smoldering corpse in a dumpster truck of garbage\nIn this mad man hell he laid in\nLogical was hatred\nSome replacement killer came through, left small traces\nEngraved his chest\nLeft him for death\nLeft him on his last breath\nCrawling, just to make a statement (hu hu huh)\nIn this matrix\nSubconsciously gazing the soft shell of a man\nSomehow found, amazing!\nBy the department of sanitation\nUnder city lights to the hospital\nHit him with the chest rockers, shockers\nPop him open just to keep his heart racing (Clear)\n\n(Chorus)\nWill he make it?\nWill he survive?\nTerror in his eyes\nNight the city cries\nPayback is crime\nHe damn near died\nBanished my wounds not mine\nThe city cries, drama ride\nGuns out the window, slide\nBefore me now the city cries\n\n(U-God)\n\nUnconscious for months (beep beep)\nDeep in coma shock\nWhen you awoke, it was hope\nDry throat\nChoking off tools, being fed ice cubes\nPain in you head\nChange of the bed\nDoped up and soaking while police on top\nDoctors monitor your heart (heart beating)\nSergeant Bilko came in with some zombie ass cops\nWhat we have here the chief embraces\nIn his hands he pulls out two briefcases\nA picture popped up on computer\nOne woman, one man, sharpshooter\nHe asked you do you remember these two faces?\n'Mind you you're blind, completely hung out to dry, victimized\nViolated as if you was raped\nWhat the hell\nYou escape well\nPolice investigated the scene\nScrape the crime scene\nDown to the bone panel\nWhile you lay frail in the enamel\nUnder you nails in the scuffle\nYou scratched some DNA samples that match\nThe blood on your clothes are not yours, it was his\nRight before you blacked out, took that blow\nIn September, you can't remember\nYou ripped his nose ring\nRight out his nose\nBefore he took it four times in the ribs\nBut somehow he lived\n]From the little bit of blood you grabbed\nHis skin type, you ran it back to forensic labs\nYour finger prints popped up\nThis is where it begins\nYour street name was Henry the Saint\nStaten Island's where your crib was at\nPark Hill project was your outlet\nYou was a target\nOr organized outfit\nNot by the mafia, this where it get chills\nYour wife hired some hitman to kill you for your ten million dollar will\nMoney fund drill\nBooby trapped perhaps\nLeft his food for the rats\nNow...\n\n(Chorus)\nWill you make it?\nWill you survive?\nTerror in your eyes\nNight the city cries\nPayback is crime\nYou damn near died\nBandaged by wounds not mine\nThe city cries, drama ride\nGuns out the window slide\nBefore me now the city cries\n\n(U-God)\n\nOne cop's weakness\nWas heroic, he exposed pieces\nLeaked out information\nOn surveillance where his wife was staying\nPolice tracked her down\nBlood hound on the east side of town\nIn some skyscraper\nThey had video tapes of her\nAnd some porn star fling, her and the next door neighbor\nAnd the killer with the nose ring\nBut the police didn't have a case\n'Cause the victim couldn't remember a thing\nNot even a face\nHe had to clear his name\nHe bit off more than he could chew\nHis absent minded flash backs grew\nAnd grew to hate\nHe had to escape\nTo ICU\nOn the second day he came through\nHe concocted the impossible\nThe psych' slipped out the cuffs\nSomehow killed to armed guards (bang, bang)\nGrabbed their guns\nBefore he fled the hospital, slivers into the night\nIf police hunting was right\nHe's seeking for justice\nOff point bulletin\nOn a black male Jamaican\nMeanwhile a dark lookable crook\nIs in a alleyway for retaliation\nA limo pulled across the street from a gas station\nHe saw his wife\nAnd the nigga that knifed him\nHe wanted to mash him\nHe was real patient\nA devilish growl sensation\nAnd the rain grew to a foul meditation (sound of rain)\nOf betrayal, murder revenge\nBitch that set you up will get hers in the end\nIn the hall of the lobby floor\nSecurity on post\nGot gun butted three times in the head with the old dusty toast\nNow he slipped past the video cameras undetected\nTo the 25th floor\nApartment 504\nWhen he rang the bell (ding dong) sweet voice said\nShe cracked it open, her reply I thought you was dead\nIn a matter of seconds and inches\nThe door was hanging off the hinges (crash)\nHer eyes met the metal\nShe screamed Oh my God\nOut the back room the killer with the nose ring\nSmashed the nigga in the head with a porcelain vase\nShots ricochet like lightning roads\nPut the bimbo in arms\nThe drapes caught on fire, with no alarm\nThey crashed out the window, but they somehow held on\nDangling from a hundred stories high\nDon't doubt him\nWill he make it?\nContinued next album\n\n(Chorus)\nWill he make it?\nWill he survive?\nTerror in his eyes\nNight the city cries\nPayback is crime\nHe damn near died\nBandaged by wounds not mine\nThe city cries, drama ride\nGuns out the window slide...\n\nGolden Arm is as good as his reputation says\nWith his bare hands he stood all of us off\nAnd if he had weapons...\n\nGolden Arm never uses weapons\nSays he doesn't need them\nHe says using his bare arms is the best\nAnd he's probably right\nNobody's beaten him yet\nJust using his arms he beat us all then\nWe had no chance\nHe had us cold", "title": "Night The City Cried", "year": null, "album": "Golden Arms
