If anybody give a damn to know\nWhat really went on in my life I wrote a song\n\n[Hook]\n[Voice talking]\nIt is now gallow time\nAll inmates are asked to get on your assigned bunks and\nRemain there until count time is made....count time...\nOlden... (yeah)\nWilliams... (here)\nMonroe... (yo)\nDurant... (here)\nPablo... Pablo.....\n\n[Petey]\nMan I was just one of the ones\nThat always wounded up in the midst of something\nStayed in trouble if I won't fuckin' up\nI love ( I love) to bring the pain\nGrowing up in Greenville, North Carolina outside of Rocky Mount\nI'm a be on the winning side\nWhen this whole life decide to give me just a little money\nYou can sell it bootleg just as long as you can get it\nWhatever...just understand me\n\n[Hook]", "year": null}]}
