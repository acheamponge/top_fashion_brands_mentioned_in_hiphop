Make it real moist\nTake the Rolls to the jet, take the jet to my yacht\nLetcha kick it for a week in my Carribbean spot\nCoconut milk bath (bath), private beach, first class (class)\nWater clear like glass (glass), waves ticklin your ass\nCut the act baby, you need a change of pace\nI deliver you a whole new world of taste\nGuaranteed to put a different timid look on your face\nPut the arch in your back when I'm grippin your waist\nWarren G keep flippin the bass on key\nCos you rollin with a G when you're rollin with me\nEasily I spit game to make it hot\nHeaded straight for the motherfuckin G-Spot, you know\n\nChorus\n\n[Warren G talking]\nSee now look at the picture\nYou got a lotta women out there preaching about\nHow they ain't a bitch or a ho but now\nIf you carry yourself in a fashionable matter\nGame can be matched both ways by a player\nNot a player hater, please believe it\nIt's told not to be sold by me\nYou know what, it ain't my fault\n\n*Val Young crooning*\nI let you, hang around, so that you, can see\n\nChorus (x1 1/2)\n\n*Warren G and Eve phone conversation*", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fc9c13a653a7912a5dca703cc2caab0a.800x800x1.jpg", "album": "I Want It All", "title": "G-Spot"}]}
