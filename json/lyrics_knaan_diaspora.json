And in my music, it's just, you know, as an African, you live an African life and you lead an African life where, you know, in your language, in your thought, and in your music, and in your way of living. And that, just like a European would lead a European life whether he's conscious of his European living or not, you know, it's like we live it, and um, I'm connected, you know, through my mother and through all sorts of things, through phone calls of like \"send me money!\"\n\n*Both laugh*\n\n[Interviewer]\nAbsolutely! It's just dope that people are starting to celebrate that...\n\n[K'naan]\nRight\n\n{Interviewer]\n...as it is something that's been denied\n\n[K'naan]\nWell, it's good. It's a real good thing and it's like, it shouldn't be fake, you know what I mean? It shouldn't be because it's, see it's--- it's not good when it's like, it's halfway there.

And that's the real thing that, you know, separates what is real and what isn't and--- But some artists, you know like, that I love are doing it real and you can tell and you can feel it and it's in their nature and they really did take back their identity, you know... artists like Dead Prez\n\n[Sample]\nI'm an African, ugh!\nAnd I know what's happening\nYou-you-you-you-you an African!"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
