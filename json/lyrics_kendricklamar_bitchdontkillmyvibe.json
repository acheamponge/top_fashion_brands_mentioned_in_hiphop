Lord, forgive me!\nThings I don't understand\nSometimes I need to be alone\nBitch, don't kill my vibe!\nBitch, don't kill my vibe!\nI can feel your energy from two planets away\nI got my drink, I got my music\nI would share it, but today I'm yelling\nBitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!\nBitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!\n\n[Verse 1]\nLook inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich\nLook inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist\nI can feel the changes\nI can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous\nI can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless\nYou don't know what pain is\nHow can I paint this picture\nWhen the color blind is hangin' with you?\nFell on my face and awoke with a scar\nAnother mistake livin' deep in my heart\nWear it on top of my sleeve in a flick\nI can admit that it did look like yours\nWhy you resent every making of this?\nTell me your purpose is petty again\nBut even a small lighter can burn a bridge\nEven a small lighter can burn a bridge\n\n[Bridge]\nI can feel the changes\nI can feel the new people around me just want to be famous\nYou can see that my city found me\nThen put me on stages, to me that's amazin'\nTo you that's a quick check\nWith all disrespect, let me say this\n\n[Chorus]\nI am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again\nLord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!\nThings I don't understand\nSometimes I need to be alone\nBitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!\nI can feel your energy from two planets away\nI got my drink, I got my music\nI would share it, but today I'm yelling\nBitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!\nBitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm tryin' to keep it alive\nAnd not compromise the feeling we love\nYou're tryin' to keep it deprived\nAnd only co-sign what radio does\nAnd I'm lookin' right past you\nWe live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles\nYou live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror\nI know what you scared of\nThe feeling of feeling emotions inferior\nThis shit is vital, I know you had to\nThis shit is vital, I know you had to\nDie in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain\nIs way more believable, give me a feasible gain\nRather a seasonal name\nI'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame\nOn yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box\nI'ma break out and then hide every lock\nI'ma break out and then hide every lock\n\n[Bridge]\nI can feel the changes\nI can feel the new people around me just want to be famous\nYou can see that my city found me\nThen put me on stages, to me that's amazin'\nTo you that's a quick check\nWith all disrespect, let me say this\n\n[Chorus]\nI am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again\nLord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!\nThings I don't understand\nSometimes I need to be alone\nBitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!\nI can feel your energy from two planets away\nI got my drink, I got my music\nI would share it, but today I'm yelling\nBitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!\nBitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!\n\n[Outro]\nBitch, don't kill my vibe!\nYou ain't heard the coast like this in a long time\nDon't you see that long line?\nAnd they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth\nThrees in the air, I can see you are in sync\nHide your feelings, hide your feelings\nNow what you better do\nI'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal\nBitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!\nWalk out the door and they scream it's alive\nMy New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution\nTalk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music\nI say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!\nBitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!\n\n[Death to Molly]\n\n[Outro]\nAyy, K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!\nCome on, we finna roll out!\nNigga, I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD\nGet yo' freestyles ready!"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
