Shit, I probably couldn't tell you\nBut honestly if you left me, I'd probably be a failure\nOr at least that's what they'll think about me\nSee, I know myself and I know I'm good without you\nAll these people, they just speak about me\nTalking out they asses saying my name\nTelling me, since I've been with you, I ain't been the same\nBut shit, I'm taking care of my mama\nMaking sure that she's happy\nGot her a brand new mattress and put food in the pantry\nShow these people that I'm everything that they said I can't be\nSo if they hate me for needing you, they don't understand me\nYeah, so how could I disrespect you?\nEven though you no good for me, I could never neglect you\nEven through hard times, you was always there when the rent due\nI don't know if it was God himself or the Devil who sent you\nBut before you came along\nI was the one they doubted, laughed at and hated on\nNow all of a sudden they not mean cause of you\nPeople talk to me, people treat me like a king cause of you\nBut back when I didn't have you, I wasn't shit\nNow everyone know you with me, they love me, go suck a dick\nYou see, I fucking hate you cause you ripped my fucking family apart\nI lost friends cause of you, how can you have a heart?\nYou don't have a heart, you don't have feelings for shit\nNo, you don't care what people go through\nYou don't care if they sick\nYou don't care if they die, what you do is sick to me\nEveryone looks at you like you ruled the world\nBut you don't mean shit to me\nYou got two sides, you got two faces\nNow you wondering who's this person and all these places\nBut this person's not human, this person can't feel\nIt's the almighty dollar that we all been chasing\nTwo faces", "year": "2016-08-07"}]}
