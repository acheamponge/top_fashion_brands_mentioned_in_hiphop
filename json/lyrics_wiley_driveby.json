I'm ready\nMake a spitter fade out like Blackberry\nI spay a whole crew of spitters cos I'm that heavy\nDon't back out if they start attacking me\nI tell an MC 'You must prepare for war'\nFrontline any time they declare war\nLyrics in the clip, get ready, no discussing it\nI put the clip into the gun and start bussing it\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Wiley]\nI drive by on MCs, take shots at them\nThey take shots at me, the whole lot of them\nI wonder who will bail out on a slick one\nCos I'm like thunder when I strike them down on a quick one\nSee, I've got an aura, sick one, check it out\nAnd the spitters on my team don't mess about\nDons who ain't ready for the war\nThen get them out, see them stepping out\nThe others stepping up, you can't forget about\nThat's why I put the lyrics in the clip, no bluffing\nThen I put the clip into the gun and starting bussing\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cd54c7751f119aa53e2eb8065e120645.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Snakes & Ladders", "title": "Drive By"}]}
