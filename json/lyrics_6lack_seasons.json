(What's the use?)\nIf you really love me, gotta prove it\nI\u2019m carrying this baggage, need to pack light\nHate seein' you sad, I gotta act right\nI'm looking forward for the brighter\nOh, my love\n\n[Chorus: 6LACK & Khalid]\nOoo, summer's calling\nA beautiful summer's calling\nOh, summer's calling\n(I done had a really long winter)\nA beautiful summer's calling\n\n[Verse 3: 6LACK]\nHave you ever looked at someone and said, \"I could spend my whole life witcha\"?\nYou're lucky the greatest thing I can do is marry you\n'Cause if I could, I'd spill my blood\nDown to give you my last breath\nThe old me is on his last stretch\nI guess a new season's next (next)\n\n[Chorus: 6LACK & Khalid]\nOoo, summer's calling\nA beautiful summer's calling\nOoo, summer's calling\n(I done had a really long winter)\nA beautiful summer's calling\n\n[Outro: Mereba]\nMiscommunication leads to complication and...\nHere we are staring at each other as strangers, sleepin' in the same bed\n'Cause it's like, you were never taught how to use your words like that\nYou were never taught how to say loving things and caring things\nYou were just taught how to say what had to be said\nSo, I want the words that you don't have and I'm stuck trying to figure out what you feel\nJust think about it, like, what might this life be like if we put our pride to the side and let love lead the way", "year": "2018-09-14", "image": "https://images.genius.com/68d505210dfe645f563d657a5dd75757.1000x1000x1.jpg"}]}
