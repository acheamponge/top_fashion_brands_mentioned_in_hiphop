in the puddle and you fell\nI stepped over your shoulders then I rough rocked your bells\nThe Zima's on the rims are yelling flex are hella rough\nI'm coming hit man style and leave your pillow filled with slugs\nMotherfuck watch I huff then I puff wet you up\nWhen im on this numby numby on Coke and Rum doing devil stuff\nKaiser Soze Tear da Club up Thugs I yell it out loud\nScarecrow I keep ganja smoke flying out my mouth\n\n{ScanMan}\nAnother war kamikazes drop them bodies onto the shore\nI thought there were no more\nEnemy Three 6 me and Crunchy bomb they click\nSo on the train in the rain Scans waiting for you man\nWhen I get ya extracts brain and wash your remains down the drain\nSo blast my words will hit you harder than a gun\nSix-thousand sounds of funk weighing more than a ton\nSo

can save him\nNow sit back relax and let this 12 inch gauge in\n\n{Project Pat}\nAutomatic gunfire when your time to die left you in a coma\nFucking off with busters in these streets got you causing drama\nMarijuana feels my congregation your affiliation\nWith the wrong click of motherfuckers got annihilation\nOn your program who's the man with the master plot\nFresh up out the pen once again with the mask and Glock\nShot you point blank range feeling strange put that ass in shock\nProject got an answer for you bitches Posse closing shop\n\n{Gangsta Boo}\nNigga nigga what whatcha whatcha wanna do\nWith your pussy ass crew trying to get a load of Boo\nI be the one to bring the pain bring the rain on a sunny day\nSmiling in your face mean mug it with a pistol play\nKnow you bitches out to hate me I'm self explanatory\nI'll leave you wet like a fat pussy in an orgy\nSnatch your fucking soul I'm the cold that's in the winters hoe\nMess with me you die you can't tango with my
