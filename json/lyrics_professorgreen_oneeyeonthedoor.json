Shit 61 missed calls\nA divorce is on the cards if I don't split\nAnd get my arse in gear, I'm asking for it\nA bastard ain't I, off weed the same\nBetter get my arse in gear and get a car quick\nThough if I'm already gonna get my arsed kicked then pass\nWhat's one more half\nWhat's one more spliff\nWhat's one more glass\nWhat's one more line\nWhat's one more toke\nI'm already a dead man when I get home\nI know I'm my own worst enemy\nHappy wife happy life but I like stress\nI dunno why\nJust seems to be that whenever there's upset I operate at my best!\n\n[Hook]\nSay you won't be home late\nBut you've been up all night\nWon't tell me where you've been\nBut you'll be occupied\nI can't do this anymore\n(One eye on the door)\nIf you got one eye on the door\n(One eye on the door)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI never said I'd be home early babe\nI was at the studio working late\nAfter work we went out for something to eat\nAnd something to eat turned into something to drink\nAnd something to drink turned into something to take\nAnd something to take turned into another mistake\nAnother mistake that I won't learn from\nI never said that I'd be home early, you heard wrong\nWhen she hears this shit, it's lights out\nI'll probably get kicked out of my house\n'til I come back with a brand new Chanel bag\nAnd shoes but I refuse to wave a white towel\nI know I'm my own worst enemy\nHappy wife happy life but I like stress\nI dunno why\nJust seems to be that whenever there's upset I operate at my best!\n\n[Hook]\nSay you won't be home late\nBut you've been up all night\nWon't tell me where you've been\nBut you'll be occupied\nI can't do this anymore\n(One eye on the door)\nIf you got one eye on the door\n(One eye on the door)\n\n[Outro]\nI will never ever ever ever ever ever do this again\nI have something to celebrate\nI dunno what it was, I swear down!\nI love you!\nSorry, sorry!", "year": "2016-10-28"}]}
