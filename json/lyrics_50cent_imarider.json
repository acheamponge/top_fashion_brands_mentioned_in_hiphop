(Nope)\nStayin' out of trouble? (Nope)\nGot a job yet? (Nope)\nI'm still sellin' dope\nI'm just playin' [?]\nLet me piss in a cup\nAnd I got shit I gotta do; you really fuckin' me up\nSee you, I could talk to you; you know what's up\nAll that drug program shit be slowin' me up\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm a rider\nWherever I'm in or out, I'm me\nWhether I'm locked or I'm free\nWhatever I'm at, I'm who I be\nYou know you wanna be a rider like me\nI'm a rider\nWherever I'm in or out, I'm me\nWhether I'm locked or I'm free\nWhatever I'm at, I'm who I be\nYou know you wanna be a rider like me\n\n[Spoken Outro]", "year": "2007-07-23"}]}
