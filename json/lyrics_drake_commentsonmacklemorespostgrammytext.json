Why are you posting your text message? Just chill. Take your W, and if you feel you didn't deserve it, go get better \u2014 make better music. It felt cheap. It didn't feel genuine. Why do that? Why feel guilt? You think those guys would pay homage to you if they won?\n\nThis is how the world works: He made a brand of music that appealed to more people than me, Hov, Kanye and Kendrick. Whether people wanna say it's racial, or whether it's just the fact that he tapped into something we can't tap into. That's just how the cards fall. Own your shit\n\nTo name just Kendrick? That shit made me feel funny. No, in that case, you robbed everybody. We all need text messages!"}]}
