Pull out my naked eye and with this..\nMy mask of sanity's about to slip!)\n\n[Verse 1]\nSittin in my room with a razor blade\nThinkin all my days are played as much as my single needs to fade away\nShoot myself in the arm and start bleedin\nDon't wanna go yet, stick a straw in my wound and taste my heart beatin\nFuckin bitch left me and I ain't even peaked yet\n(Fuck all that noise playboy, this leak's wet)\nSmoke a bundle to the face lace my brain and neurons\nCarvin all my downfalls into my fuckin forearm\n(Cage snap out of this, it's just a girl)\nIt's just the world, it's just a life, it's just a rusty Rambo knife\nWedged between my ribs scratchin my heart up tonight\nI'm gonna pull this shit off in front of all my friends\nWent swimmin under the Brooklyn Bridge tryna catch the bends\nDidn't swim deep enough my head imploded ten percent\nFloated to the surface, the paramedic's like - what's this dent?\n(I want everbody to back up, he's still alive)\n\n[Hook - repeat 2X]\nI'm a suicidal failure, look my life's a failure\nI can't make it in rap because my birth's an error\nDo what I can to catch a quick death\nBut I'm meant to be here and that's the fuckin hell I live with\n\n[Verse 2]\nTook the phone off the hook, ate multi-colored pills\nWashed it down with Absolut and started writin out my will\nGive my dawg bootlegs PS2 and DC\nTo my girl who left me when she said, \"Pick me or PCP\"\nSince I love to smoke I thought it was a joke\nTried to hang myself and I fell free from the rope\nBroke both my arms, my neck smashed my femur\nGot up somehow and limped in front of a beamer\nCracked my rib cage, look what you did Cage, you're dying\nBut I'm not dead yet I'm still trying\nCut my wrist and walked past some crips bleedin red\nIn hopes that I get shot in the fuckin head\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI drank a bottle of Jack, sniffed three bottles of kitty\nIn the middle of the freeway walkin to the city\nSo much PCP I changed my name to watermouth\nPumpin Masta Ase I walked into a jewish +Slaughtahouse+\nThrow myself on the hook, now that's the chorus\nGot split from my neck to my dick, now that's what gore is\nHollow man look at all my dangling parts\nDropping to the gutter with a piece of you in my heart\nLittle piece of shit that I couldn't fling from my chest\nShould of stayed alive long enough to kill the fag you're with\nBut right now, my skin is gettin stripped off\nEach one of my limbs is ripped off covered in thick sauce\nMy head hits the conveyer, I'm not thick and a prayer is sick\nI'm wacthin a movie at Loewe's alone and you suckin some guy's dick\nSix seconds left when I die I'm gonna find her\nOn some Poltergeist shit while my face goes through the grinder\n\n[Hook]"}]}
