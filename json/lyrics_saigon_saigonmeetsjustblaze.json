Check me out\n\n[Verse 1 \u2013 Saigon]\nYou could get your body hurt badly in an hour\nY\u2019all niggas sing like Mariah Carey in the shower\nOr Eddie King Jr. before the brain tumor\nLyrically, Sai nasty as a crack fiend bloomer\nI flow with a glisten and glow.  I\u2019m positioned to blow\nKnow I'm bout getting some dough, I\u2019m dismissin\u2019 a ho\nKnow I\u2019m conditioned to go.  Fo\u2019 plus fo\u2019 mo\u2019\nKnow that my biscuit\u2019ll blow\u2014that I did it befo\u2019\nAnd this is real talk\u2014not no fake shit\nI rhyme with such a complexity\u2014y\u2019all so basic\nA true song from you would go, \u201cI don\u2019t make sense\nAnd me and none of my niggas is not no gangsters.\u201d\nBut I was a prisoner though\nI let six of \u2018em go.  Know that I\u2019m sick with the flow\nKnow I don\u2019t stick with the po\u2019.  Know that I kick in your do'\nI get bricks to your blow.  Know that my niggas\u2019ll go \u201cBoom!

I\u2019m a lyrical pro\nKnow niggas be bitin\u2019, but you know I\u2019m original, though\nKnow I\u2019m conditioned to go.  Fo\u2019 plus fo\u2019 mo\u2019\nKnow that yo\u2019 bitch is a ho.

Know I was getting the snow\nDown on the visiting floor.  Know I\u2019m predicted to go\nGold out this muhfucka\nKnowing my clique in the show is ridiculous, yo\n\n[Outro]\nYea!
