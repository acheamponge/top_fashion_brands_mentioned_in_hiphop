(Die!)\nThen I read my Genesis\nNigga I train and I train for when they aim for my change\nAt the range ain't a thang they know my name and it's Strange\nLeave your brains on the terrain dead if he came for the games\nNot to explain but me and my dame keep a thang and it bangs! Ekk ket ket ket ket ket pooh pooh pdddit nigga\nTaking the living to necro\nThey never knew Missouri killas would be hillbillies like Jethro Bodine, slept slow, codeine I'm so mean like Destro\nAnd I got the green like a gecko\nAnd I'ma never let go of it\n\n[Chorus: Big Scoob]\nHigh prices on the blow (let go)\nSo it's hard to get dough (let go)\nTried to run up in my pad\nTrying to hit me for my cash\nSo I thum-thum-thum (had to let go)\nSick and tired of this shit (let go)\nOld homie turned snitch (let go)\nHomies brought it to the light\nRedded all in black and white like oh no (had to let go)"}], "artist": "Big Scoob"}
