Blanca Reyes of Group 1 Crew)\n\nYour gonna make it\nYes your gonna make it\nDon't you worry about a thing that's happened in your life\nYour gonna make it\nYes your gonna make it\nDon't you worry about a thing it's gonna be alright\n\nYou may feel like your just starting over\nMistakes from your past that just want to hold ya\nDown to the ground its all on your shoulder\nYou'll never make it now that's what they told ya\nYou start to figure out who really cares for ya\nWhen no ones around no one is there for ya\nWhen I was down and out and life was getting colder\nWee I found that's when God showed up\nYour trying to make it right they make it hard for ya\nBut God will take a life even if it's broke up\nGive you strength to fight whatever's coming toward ya\nAnd don't forget that I'm always praying for ya\n\nIt's not fair all the things that just had to happen\nSome days you wake up and feel like you've been abandoned\nLife didn't shape up in the way that you planned it\nThe life you live is not the one that you imagined\nI know they laugh and pick on you\nI know you've had a lot of junk that you gone through\nBut I know who would never ever wrong you\nNever quit on you and help you get on thru\nWhen you fell he was the one who caught you\nWith every single tear man see he saw you\nHe was right there every time he called you\nAnd I'll be praying for you gonna get on through\n\nYou try to pray but feel too ashamed too\nCuz those around you they just wanna blame you\nBut don't listen now just to what they say dude\nGod loves you he never hates you\nYou can count on the fact that hes faithful\nAlways exactly on time always came thru\nWhen your blind you feel you lost your way too\nHe'll guide you and help you to find your way through\nHe knows you he's the one that made you\nIn anything you go thru now he can save you\nAnd help you and plus give you strength too\nYou're gonna make it man you're gonna be ok dude"}]}
