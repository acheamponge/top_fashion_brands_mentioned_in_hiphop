{"songs": [{"title": "Homeward Bound", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nGotta go.  You know I stay up on my tippy toes\nFloatin\u2019 like a Cadillac through Kaki-lak, dusty roads\nMoney\u2019s low.  Niggas know good bills is high\nGotta ride.  Gotta fly\u2014planning to\nPlus, I\u2019m gonna kick it in Atlanta too\nJust to handle a few things\nDudes be protecting they blocks and never move kings\nI change my game like comebacks.  Sure, I\u2019mma comeback\nBut right now, I had enough of that\u2014I gotta make tracks\n\n[Hook]\nState to state, new city and town\nI been around, but I\u2019m homeward bound\nA fast pace and I can\u2019t slow down\nSolid ground.  I\u2019ll be homeward bound\nState to state, new city and town\nI been around, but I\u2019m homeward bound\nChange the place, switch my hustle around\nHold me down.  I\u2019ll be homeward bound\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, chip on my shoulder, city blocks on my back\nThe only way Akir know how to act\nI react to the scene and snatch up the green in between shit\nChecking on my queen, staying with terrific leans on a different ride\nSlide into the other side.  Fly from my mother\u2019s side\nNice guy.  Slide from my pop\u2019s side\nI move around a lot, never really had a spot\nBut learn to read characters and how to pick locks\nAkir\u2014one-man band.  My home is where I land\nArms around my fam, eyes on a different scam \u2018til it jam\nDamn, gotta scram \u2018fore the man come\nI try to hit the can, son, \u2018cause I\u2019m too handsome\n\n[Hook]\nState to state, new city and town\nI been around, but I\u2019m homeward bound\nA fast pace and I can\u2019t slow down\nSolid ground.  I\u2019ll be homeward bound\nState to state, new city and town\nI been around, but I\u2019m homeward bound\nChange the place, switch my hustle around\nHold me down.  I\u2019ll be homeward bound\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, I travel like a veteran where\u2026 ever I settle and\nMaking money peddling, X-Game medaling\nFiending like Carol when the [?] end\nI\u2019mma win regardless \u2018cause I\u2019m a nigga that\u2019s plotting the hardest\nRap artist at eighteen.  College, I dropped out\nCrapped out the rap game, became a model scout\nGetting change for bagging dames\nNineteen, a producer\nAcid on computers, waitin\u2019 tables just to get my loot up\nCash and credit card numbers\u2014they was on a slumber\nQuit for the music.  That summer, nigga, I\u2019m on the come-up\nGot a job telemarketing, still on the grind\nGotta put the manager, started selling \u2018em double lines\nPaycheck, monthly bonus, and extra dough they throw us\nUntil we got busted down.  S\u2019no wonder, disgusted, I\u2019m out\nPromotions for different majors.  Second company\nTwenty-one, first client that\u2019s really supplying papers\nOff-the-book cash.  Traveled and we had a blast\nThe web boom to the whole stock market crash\nGot a job doing car rentals.  It was instrumental\nShit, I had places to get to.  It didn\u2019t pay enough\nTimes are tough, paper\u2019s essential\nI knew there was more to offer\nPut on a suit.  In a month, cellphone and office\nBack and forth to record my album\nDropped the job, kept the cars, and pressed up a couple thousand wiling\nFrom the South to Manhattan Island\nA man\u2019s prowess is important as his callouses\u2014enormous, kid\nAnd now I rock shit.  Suburbs, back to the hood\nNew York\u2019s my stomping ground, America\u2019s my neighborhood", "year": "2006-03-20", "album": "Legacy", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ec568067b0f966b9ee18a0f87677e60e.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "AKIR"}
