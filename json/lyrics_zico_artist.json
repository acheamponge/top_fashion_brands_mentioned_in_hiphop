Translation\n\n[Hook]\nWe are we are we artist baby\nWe are we are we artist ZICO\n\n[Verse 1]\nI have a good feeling, just thought of an idea\nI live my weekends like it\u2019s the weekday\nSo I\u2019m gonna get an award, alright\nMy schedule was jam packed again this year\nThey all recognize me when I go out\nFanxy child is freakin hot\nBut still, I'm lonely\nWhat should I do\n\nPeople who are about to die of boredom\nPeople who can never be high class\nPeople who scratch and get bumps\nPeople who are gonna kill it, oh yes\nHow much longer are your heads gonna be noisy?\nIf you have deep knowledge on art\nLet\u2019s draw something\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFrom now on\nTurn every back to a blank canvas\nDon\u2019t think, just do, you\u2019re holding the brush\nYou have the most sense when you\u2019re in front of the mirror\nLife is short Art is long\nYou or me or him, I make em say\n\n[Hook]\nAh We are we artist baby\nWe are we are we artist baby\nWe are we are we artist baby\nHey Life is short Art is long\nYou or me or him, I make\u2019em say\n\n[Verse 2]\nLet me think about it\nWhat exactly am I gonna earn\nBy making this song all day?\nWhen can I maintain my dignity if I work all the time?\nIf there\u2019s traffic, go the other way\nPress down your cap, put your shoes on half way\nBreathe in the outside air and look around\nNo one can judge you\nI design my own life, get up\n\nRelax or else you\u2019ll hurt your neck\nLet go of things you can\u2019t grasp\nDon\u2019t take keep the old colors\nHum like you do in the shower, like whoo yes\nI won\u2019t age, I\u2019ll just spit the years out\nIf my words are persuasive\nMake some noise\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFrom now on\nTurn every back to a blank canvas\nDon\u2019t think, just do, you\u2019re holding the brush\nYou have the most sense when you\u2019re in front of the mirror\nLife is short Art is long\nYou or me or him, I make em say\n\n[Hook]\nAh We are we artist baby\nWe are we are we artist baby\nWe are we are we artist baby\nHey Life is short Art is long\nYou or me or him, I make\u2019em say\n\n[Bridge]\nDon\u2019t push back fun, it\u2019s impossible to save it up\nIf somebody say, maybe when I grow up\nThat grown up time is now\nIf the world ends tomorrow\nAnswer me what you gon' do\nAsking about the edge of happiness is prohibited\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNow on\nTurn every back to a blank canvas\nDon\u2019t think, just do, you\u2019re holding the brush\nYou have the most sense when you\u2019re in front of the mirror\nLife is short Art is long\nYou or me or him, I make em say\n\n[Hook]\nAre are are are artist baby\nWe are are are are artist baby\nAre are are are artist baby\n\nOne more time\nLife is short Art is long\nYou or me or him, I make\u2019em say\n\nHangul\n\n[Hook]\nWe are we are we artist
