think I'm panicking\nItching to see how I handle it\nWhen snakes start rattling, calm\nI can show you about harm\nPut blades in the palms, half the length of my arm\nI end up in a station and I'm staring into space like a mannequin in Clarks\nI ain't panicking, I ain't had a random change of heart\nCash points and cannabis\nYou cocaine snort, if you think I got caught\nI'm kicking like a stallion\nI lived in a yard where my mummy tried hard\nFor all the things that I wanted but my money was inadequate\nProbably be killed by my cousins back in Africa\nIf they knew I risked my free water, hot food and resources\nEvery day to dress nicer on a camera\nI don't need your input, fuck you and your manager\nFuck him and his lame job\nIt's been two years, you're sitting in the same spot\nChilling in the same blocks\nMe and you are different\nYou talk about beef\nWhile I plan your route home bruv\nI run up in your safe spot and leave the place taped off\nIt's deeper than the name drop\nReal problems don't need discussions\nI fear God and not repercussions\nLook, I'm only angry at the choices that I didn't make\nI don't regret what I did but what I didn't say\nAnd for this money I'm on a different wave\nIt's why I ain't written in this will when I say I'm on his estate\nIt comes arms well I've got an entourage like Vinny Chase\nThis ain't Chiraq, we don't need a .38\nJust two young g's, one Nike pouch and his little blade\nAnd if you live that day, give thanks to your God\n'Cause there isn't one prayer mummy didn't say\nStill wonder what my dad would say\nAnd it's fucked 'cause I just wanted us to bond like Sean Connery and Daniel Craig\nNo first steps, nah, my daddy couldn't see me cry\nI'm still searching for the reason why\nI was 6 months old at a bus stop\nMy mum no home struggling to ketamine like a legal high\nWhen so volatile, look over the reasons why\nPeople die, man this beef never sleeps or slides\nMan are dying over minor violations\nSo I keep the beef and the bread separate like TGI's\nThey touch us and we pay 'em back like it's PPI\nFuck it, let's ride, get animated like CGI\nDead being a hype man\nCan't find my man and then I'll settle for his right hand\nYou can't buy heart remember\nHawk eye, you think these undercover cars could get us\nOr that I can't spot the bacon in the passing Vectras\nDon't you find it funny that I study law\nAnd still recruit young fraud stars like I'm Harvey Specter\nHot headed, I swear that I had a dream though\nA young fire before I had spoken with Avelino\nAnd nowadays music's got my schedule looking hectic\nI ain't got a timeline, I'm Travolta with Tarantino\nLook, I ain't slacking, it's money over passion\nI mean passion over money, hate this money with a passion\nMoney is just a paper\nI got value of my assets, I got value of my mental\nIt's me, Fraser or 169 on an instrumental\nI swear that'll make it rapping\nEven if that kills me I swear that'll make it happen\nOn my digital piano until my hands bled literally\nI was smashing keys 'til my fingers grew callus\nHow could I fear rappers?\nI feel words, hear colours, defeat challenge\nGive thanks to my synaesthesia\nI ain't a rapper I'm a fucking genius\nSo when I see you don't panic\nRemember what you said on the roads, there's no lacking\nI don't wanna see you draw for your boot, there's no time\nI'll jump out the passenger side like there's no traffic\nCatch you with your girl or your mum, you'd do the same\nSo we'll take you to an inch of your life for all your chatting\nShut your fucking mouth and make p's\nI used to let disrespect slide to make peace\nNow it's like I'm stuck in two minds in my reaction\n'Cause my pride and my ego turned giant like James Dean\nI'm a mess right, and if that catty doesn't fuck me the third time\nWith no strings attached like a test drive\nI'm telling her I'm cutting in the next 5\nAll communication breaking down like an enzyme\nMy second's the most precious commodity I invest time\nI was late every day straight for 3 years\nGuess that's two ways that I could never make a deadline\nI was out in Powerleague Norbury in my north face camo\nIn the rain, hail, sleet, with my football in a deadline\nScraping by on pennies, trying to link a jezzy\nOn my 8520 and I couldn't link one\nSquares was a game\nHad me all stressed\nGot finessed by my main\nAnd he didn't get touched\nHad me sitting there pissed\nThinking 'bout my people\nAll the times that we missed\nLike have you ever lost love?\nHave you ever had a guy that would die so you live in a cage\nKept away from your brother and your mum\nIn my world you're unsure to the people you can trust\nAnd when you lose the only person that was there from the jump\nI'm as humble as they come\nAnd I ain't changed from the knife and the cypher to the shotgun shells in the party with a pump\nAsk Edem, ask Paddy\nWith squares I had strikers but I'm more like Ibra\nOver Vardy when it's beef\nBecause I hardly ever run I've got pride\nI've seen man running for their life\nGet caught, now they're covering their heart and their lungs with their arms on his ones\n'Cause his right hand panicked\nAnd I don't even blame him\nSeen a man scream while he bleeds on the pavement\nGuts in his hands, civilians with tissue putting pressure where the pain is\nThe panic as you fade in, blocking out sounds\nLike your body shuts down when your organs start failing\nKnife crime dangerous, next day famous\nGive it six years they won't remember what your name is\nEverything changes when your case is irrelevant\nAnd all the guys who claim they would ride in your name looking lost, them boys don't have half the heart to settle it\nI've seen a whole class end up dead or in jail\nAsk Scales about times he was chilling with my brother in a chicken shop opposite the entrance to Tenison's\nEverybody's dying, but nobody is rising up a Remington\nWe've got shanks, and false hope everybody's selling it\nYou ain't getting rich quick trying to sell big bits\nToo lazy to work so you want to own a business\nOr a clothing line, no vision\nYou can't cut corners in a line of life\nKarma's like the tightest vice\nI'm running on my own\nCCTV's in your hands bro, they've got it in your phone\nIf they catch me going home\nLooking for another young rapper to expose\nI'm probably cutting from the scene\n'Cause with all the evidence they gain I'm getting more than just assault\nI ain't living for the gram, man are snitching on the cam\nIf I hit him then I'm dumb, but if he dips me he's the man\nI can't win, there's no way I'm handling that\nIf I run then I'm a neek, but if I don't then I'm a fool\nSo on road I'm looking happy but I'm screaming in my head having panic attacks\nThey got me anxious\nAnd two wrong responses from a shanking at any given time\nI been there and done that on many different nights\nIt's probably the reason that I got many different rhymes\nI'm really living
