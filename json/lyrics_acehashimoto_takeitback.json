Can we set it back?\nOh wait, are you mad cause I wouldn't follow back?\nBut I'm the man, I can't follow if I wear the pants\nIn this relationship, \"In a relationship\"?\nWhy you want that on Facebook, 'cause people sayin' shit?\nThese Facebook walls is treated like Berlin\nAnd break 'em down, this ain't the end of the world if\nWe ain't official when it comes to the online\nCause when it comes to our minds, you are on mine\nFuck all that cyber shit, girl, you the one I'm vibin' wit'\nMy ride-or-die chick and the one that I'm ridin' wit'\nOn the offline, you're always my baby\nMan, relationships were so much easier in the eighties\n\n[Outro]\nI swear, I wanna (Take it back!), take it back, take it back\nCh-ch (Take it back!), take it back, take it back\nI wanna (Take it back!), take it back, take it back\nCh-ch (Take it back!), ch-ch, uh", "year": null, "album": "All Day DeShay: AM"}], "artist": "Ace Hashimoto"}
