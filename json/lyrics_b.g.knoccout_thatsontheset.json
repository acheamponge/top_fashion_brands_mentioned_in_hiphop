Capo fix\n\nI\u2019ll stick you\nIn the old six fat with a rash\nLife is fucked up\nAnd none ripped the task\nWraps rolled up\nHalf a bit in the bag\nLeft the roof back\nJust to  flick the ash\nDon\u2019t talk\nJust listen and ask\nWhen the grass high\nHit a six liberty task\nGot the Glock\nCook  the Chopper\nCouldn't fit in the dash\nAnd the back shells\nWith an empty clip in the stash\nLet\u2019s go\n\nEast side\nI\u2019m gonna ride\nTill I die\nGetting high\nGo to war\nIt\u2019s an eye for an eye\n\nEast side\nI\u2019m gonna ride\nTill I die\nGetting high\nGo to war\nIt\u2019s an eye for an eye\n\nGot a blue Caprice\nAnd when I came up\nShe was the\nOnly hole  in it\nReal small waist\nWith a large ass\nThat\u2019s about a six\nTray parked in the street\nScarred knuckles\nFrom getting whipped\nWith bell buckles\nStar stupid niggas\nTrying to be like my uncle\nCheck my first stack\nAnd a nigga starting to chuckle\nThat\u2019s when I dedicated\nMy life to the hustle\nStart thinking murder\nIs my passion\n\nRather go out and shoot him\nWith a bag of dough\nSending you a letter\nWith a ransom note\nAll I know are the streets\nThat we grew up on\nNice day for having money\nAnd dying hard\nHalf a penny Hondas\nAnd luxury five stars\nA lot of holes\nBut the green\nKept my big heart\nMy homies in jail\nOr they dead\nIt\u2019s a grave yard\n\nEast side\nI\u2019m gonna ride\nTill I die\nGetting high\nGo to war\nIt\u2019s an eye for an eye\n\nEast side\nI\u2019m gonna ride\nTill I die\nGetting high\nGo to war\nIt\u2019s an eye
