That's the weight of my craft\nI breathe easy, and let my chest slowly contract\nAnd write rhymes to inform baby not to uplift\nIf you wanna make it all, you gotta persist (yo put me on)\nYeah, all that talk's a waste\nCause I can read a man's thoughts by the way the lines cross his face\nHold five, everything live\nAnd I vibe, ain't nobody thought this day would arrive\nBut I balance my talents with a hope and a drive\nAnd ride beats dog, that's where my focus derive\nAnd keep notepads and vocab, that's my guide\nAnd if I got legit beef, I don't let it slide - what now\n\n[Hook]\n\n[John Cena]\nMy brain is impossible to thinkin philosophical\nHustle in my blood, that's the only thing that's logical\nThe only thing I gotta do to stay on or stay strong\nI ain't stoppin 'til I own the field that y'all play on\nDesperado - eyes like a bird of prey\nCold soldier - crack snap your vertebrae\nNo heater - flow sweeter than Cohiba\nCinnamon dip, spice ride in the cinnamon whip\nQuite wide on the benjamin clip\nMight slide but we ain't gonna slip - no way\nIf the meek shall inherit the earth, guess what?\nY'all get the globe if they measure in, lyrical worth\nTrademarc flow first, make the mental work\nFuck a verse - I rearrange your dental work\nAnd when it pop off, we not soft\nWe like the Bentleys; y'all just the Chrysler knockoffs\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Tha Trademarc]\nBut that's life, yeah you hearin me right\nIt's like I had to find the black of night\nCome back to life with master insight that shine bright - I'm always learnin\nMy burden, to blow up gifts like this, I must endure the slow burnin\nIt's sort of strange, my philosophy's changed\nI take chances, jump before the water's in range\nAnd never wait for safe answers so if all that remains\nIs lookin back at my life it never seems like I wasted glances\nMan it's all a big game, that's why it doesn't mean a thing\nThat I get money and fame, it's all the same\nIf you call me Trademarc or if you know my real name\nMarc Predka ain't attached to ego\nHe's a hero for the average people, a blessing\nWho transcends the essence of a poet with a street flow\nIt's not lip service I don't speak to hear myself talk\nAnd I don't wanna be a teacher; I'm grateful for all I've been taught\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "John Cena & Tha Trademarc"}
