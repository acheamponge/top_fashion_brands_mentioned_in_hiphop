Ain\u2019t no one here to tell me otherwise\nIt gets more difficult to stay inside during the summertime\nBut most of the time it\u2019s just like any other time\nAvoid personal interaction and human touch, shut the blinds\nIt\u2019s been a while since I left this bachelor pad\nI need to go to the market soon cause the food is going bad\nThe food is bad. I found it\u2019s difficult to just cook for one\nWith healthy recipes, well, depending on what book they\u2019re from\nIf you want to eat healthy you gotta dirty some dishes\nThe frozen dinners quickly ready to serve and it\u2019s so delicious\nIt\u2019s not delicious, it\u2019s disgusting, but it satiates the hunger with a quickness\nAnd hey, at least it\u2019s something, at least it\u2019s something\nAt most it\u2019s nothing, fuck\u2019s wrong with me? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just adjusting\nIt\u2019s been a month since I left this cabin\nThe doctor was worried about a fever and other difficulties I\u2019ve been having\nShe called me on Christmas, that was my gift\nShe was worried I might die, I said \u201cI might die? No shit\u201d\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt\u2019s been forever since I said something that I can\u2019t wiggle free from\nIf there\u2019s anything I cherish in this self-inflicted prison, it\u2019s freedom\nComes at a cost so I\u2019m private to a fault til I default\nOn the loan for home, it\u2019s actually more like a vault\nNo one knows the combo but little old me\nThe head honcho, the holder of the key\nAlone, but never lonely\nIt\u2019s been a millennia since I left this dominion\nBeen in the company of any women\nAt least I got my kittens\nSpent more cash on my cat than I did myself\nWhen he stopped eating, I took him to the vet so they could check his health\nThey put a feeding tube into his neck\nI said \u201cPlease let this work cause if it doesn't I got nothing left\u201d\nI didn\u2019t say that, but they saw that. Cat had my tongue\nI didn\u2019t speak at all, they told me to call back\nWhat, it wasn't weird I did nothing but stand right there?\nWith a \"fix this, money\u2019s no object\" type stare\nIt\u2019s been a year since I stepped into anyone else\u2019s private quarters\nI\u2019ve been busy self-diagnosing disorders\nFirst world problems, yeah, USA, number one\nTop of the world, I\u2019m in a tux and cummerbund\nWelcome everyone to the party of the century\nIt\u2019s sure to be one for the books, no doubt, medical ones especially\n\n[Outro]\nMy 20\u2019s were a roar, my 30\u2019s were a blur\nMy 40\u2019s, I\u2019m not so sure, but I\u2019mma make \u2018em purr\nMy 20\u2019s were a roar, my 30\u2019s were a blur\nMy 40\u2019s, I\u2019m not so sure, but I\u2019mma make \u2018em purr\nMy 20\u2019s were a roar, my 30\u2019s were a blur\nMy 40\u2019s I\u2019m not so sure, but I\u2019mma make \u2018em purr\nAnd I\u2019mma make \u2018em purr, but, but I\u2019mma make \u2018em purr\nI\u2019mma make \u2018em purr", "album": "Copper Gone"}], "artist": "Sage Francis"}
