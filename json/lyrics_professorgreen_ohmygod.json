I've no idea\nBut catch a whiff of my fingers and you can still smell Susan\nMouth like ashtray, breath stinking a liquor\nPocket full of change in yesterdays get up\nThe same jeans I had on the day before last\nI guess I'm rap's George Best with a lot more cess\nThat's a little more liqour and a lot more sex\n\n[Hook: Labrinth]\nSometimes we take it to far\nKnocked out sick on my guitar\nAnd I hear them say oh my God\nSay oh my God, say oh my God\nLay my head down on the bar\nCause whisky never tastes so good\nWhen I hear them say oh my God\nSay oh my God, say oh my God\n\n[Verse 2: Professor Green]\nThe first toke on the piggy made me shiver\nSip a, K, while picking at yesterday's dinner, plate\nThe way I say things it figures I'm paid\nSlicker when I think say, spitters made victims a they\nIf your insane and wanna get in my way pic a\nDay when you wanna get hit with a rake\nMr diss me not, I'm frisky, what?\nStill itching to stick me cock in Pixie Lott\nJust call me rap's George Best with a lot more cess\nA little more liqour and a lot more sex, yes\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Professor Green]\nI do drugs cause I like the buzz\nGo sleep and wake up feeling like I tried to fight a bus\nA barely functioning alcoholic\nLiving life like a student with a popstar's wallet\nAlways smiling with my new teeth\nTwo E's, two pupils, two two P's\nIn a chemical romance and I'm loved up\nThe mascot for a generation full of fuck ups\n\n[Bridge: Labrinth & Professor Green x2]\nDon't be afraid, it's alright\nDon't be afraid, it's all good\nI'm in a daze\nAlways my yesterday's a blur\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2010-07-16"}]}
