Make an idolant brigade\nSo eager to walk planks, they will climb a tree and wait\nTheir irony is waning over piety and faith\nSo when the ghostly ruminations come, we'll kindly disobey it\nI will live to be a thousand with the patience of a saint\nTo see the hoi polloi becoming restless in their tanks\nCan't hold howls in corrals with a key\nSo will the worms please shriek on the count of three\n(THREE!)\n\n[Verse 9: Rob Sonic]\nIf I had a dollar for every time I couldn't sleep\nI could buy a million locks and finally read a book in peace\nNo more would my president come off as a crooked thief\nAnd turn my heart so dark that it would bark when he looked for me\n\n[Verse 10: Aesop Rock]\nSideways eye on a sinister boundary\nPanel of contemporaries killing me loudly\n99 models of fear on the wall timorous\nDone running into to the car on the wrong cinder blocks\n\n[Hook]\nWhether you levitate or bend spoons\nWhether you levitate or bend spoons\nWhether you levitate or bend spoons\nWhether you levitate or bend spoons\n\nThree legged dogs that chew up the wrong food\nRiff Raff (?) with (?) wolves\nLand sharks know to take money, money, lose\nDark Heart News!
