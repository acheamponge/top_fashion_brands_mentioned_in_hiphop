Baby!\nKanye, this that 1970s Heron flow, huh?\nYeah, let's speed it up\nUh, I'm back in\nThey don't know we finna kill the game this year\nUh, uh\nKilla! 'Ye! C'mon!\n\n[Verse 1: Cam'ron]\nAyo street mergers I legislated, the nerve I never hated\nOn murders pre-meditated, absurd! I hesitated\nObserve: cock and spray, hit you from a block away\nDrinking sake on a Suzuki; we in Osaka Bay\nPlaying soccer, stupid, stay in a sucker's place\nPluck ya ace, take ya girl, fuck her face\nShe dealing with Killa so you love her taste\nShe swallowing Killa cause she love the taste\nI got brought up with crooking, kitchen orders that I'm cooking\nBut got caught up with the juxs\nYou would've thought I was from Brooklyn\nIt gets boring just looking\nDid like Bill Cosby, pouring in the pudding\nNow the dashboard is wooden from a hard-tangled grammar\nInterior, inferior, star-spangled banner\nCar game bananas, mob manning tanners\nGuns everywhere, like the car came with hammers, he's back\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West (Syleena Johnson)]\nThey trying to say he (I'm down, down)\nI hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)\nBut our flow is the truest (oh)\nThe game's in the nooses (no no)\nOur girls is the models (oh)\nThey coochies the juiciest (ooooh)\nYeah, they say he (I'm down, down)\nYeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)\n'Cause I'm back on my grind (oh)\nMoney back on my mind (no no)\nYe' and Killa Cam', the world is mine (oooh)\n\n[Verse 2: Cam'ron]\nI treat bitches straight up, like Simon Says\nOpen vagina: put ya legs behind ya head\nCop me Air Ones, hon, lime and red\nYou got pets? Me too: mines are dead, doggy\nFox, minks, gators, that's necessary\nAccessories, my closet's \"Pet Sematary\"\nI get approached by animal activists\nI live in a zoo, I run scandals with savages\nAll my niggas get together to gather loot\nBodyguard for what? Dog, I'd rather shoot\nI go to war, old Timbs, battered boots\nHand grenade, goggles and a parachute\nY'all don't even know the name of my flip\nIt was Touch Me, Tease Me when Case was the shit\nYou don't know bout the cases I get:\nCourt case, briefcase, suitcase, cases of Cris', aaow!\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West (Syleena Johnson)]\nThey trying to say he (I'm down, down)\nI hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)\nBut our flow is the truest (oh)\nThe game's in the nooses (no no)\nOur girls is the models (oh)\nThey coochies the juiciest (ooooh)\nYeah, they say he (I'm down, down)\nYeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)\n'Cause I'm back on my grind (oh)\nMoney back on my mind (no no)\nYe' and Killa Cam', the world is mine (oooh)\n\n[Verse 3: Cam'ron]\nUh, Killa, yo, yo...\nAyo you dealing with some sure shit, my bitches pure thick\nPlay razor tag, slice ya face, you're it!\nIt's I who come by drive-thru\nGator-toed Mauri, three quarters, sky blue\nLook at mami: eyes blue, 5'2''\nI approached her \"Hi boo, how you?\nPony skin Louis? Oh, you fly too\nYou a stewardess? Good ma, I fly too\"\nNow a nigga got baking to bake\nHarlem Shake? Nah, I'm in Harlem shaking awake\nShaking to bake, shaking the Jakes\nKill you, shoot the funeral up and Harlem Shake at your wake\nJust ya picture though, you still taped in a lake\nI'm laughing; you couldn't wait to escape\nFor anyone who owed the dough, I had to load the fo'\nI hope a nigga heard when I said \"I told you so\"\nUh, Killa\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West (Syleena Johnson)]\nThey trying to say he (I'm down, down)\nI hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)\nBut our flow is the truest (oh)\nThe game's in the nooses (no no)\nOur girls is the models (oh)\nThey coochies the juiciest (ooooh)\nYeah, they say he (I'm down, down)\nYeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)\n'Cause I'm back on my grind (oh)\nMoney back on my mind (no no)\nYe' and Killa Cam', the world is mine (oooh)\n\n[Outro: Cam'ron]\nMine! Killa, you already know Harlem\nWhole Midwest, Detroit, Naptown, St. Louis\nChicago of course\nWestside, holla at me\nSouthside wild hundreds\nYou know what it is Ohio\nColumbus, holla at ya boy\nYou know what else I do:\nDayton, Youngstown, Cleveland, Cincinnati"}]}
