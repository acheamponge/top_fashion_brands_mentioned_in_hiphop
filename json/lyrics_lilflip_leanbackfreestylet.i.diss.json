Beef is when a nigga like you can't eat\nWake up with no apatite and you can't eat\nBetter Look both ways when you walk in the street\nCause you don't wanna bump heads with a nigga like me\nRubber man with the AK shit\nBut your first album flopped with that Reggae shit\nHolla back nigga, hahaha"}], "artist": "Lil Flip"}
