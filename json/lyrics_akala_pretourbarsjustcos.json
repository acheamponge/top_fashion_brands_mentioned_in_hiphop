Is that our fate?\nJust enough poor people left to clean up the dirt\nGo kill yourselves in the sticks where the shots can\u2019t be heard\nLeave the centre to the civilised people, to improve\nYou know the type that want to have their carnival without coons\nMove you little paupers; fuck your sons and daughters\nYour lives and your communities are not important\nWe can all pretend that it's just market forces\nRather than the social engineering which it of course is\nThey say they don\u2019t believe in hand outs, fucking liars\nLook how we bailed out the banks and didn\u2019t nationalise them\nYou can make it if your enterprising right? Try it, just like I did\nThat\u2019s what I'm supposed to say, when you ask me how my life is\nBut that ignores the facts and all the things that I have seen\nAll the blood that's put before my eyes when I was just a teen\nI ain't being dramatic\nOr beggin\u2019 gangster life\nTruth is though I did do wrong, I\u2019m living on borrowed time\nRappers rhymes starting to sound clever, like they borrowed mine\nYou learn nothing from me it MUST be that you ain\u2019t got to sign\nAin\u2019t got to hide it from them brother if you got a mind\nDid our people not bleed for the right to read in another time\nWatch the youths back in Yard, back in Nigeria\nDo they reject knowledge? Are we serious?\nSo whose culture is it then for us to act foolish?\nWho we entertaining and serving with our bullshit\nWith my dreads, with my picky head, with my hoody on\nChief up these so called scholars go off and write a song\nYeah I think deeply, man is so neeky\nBut still box man in their mouth for getting cheeky\nThink I'm exceptional? That's not true\nI\u2019m like most of my brothers that grew up on the Wu\nI don\u2019t respect a lack of honesty or authenticity\nReady for anyone think they can talk to me lyrically\nPhysically, I ain\u2019t superman nor a massive dude\nBut train everyday like a soldier, what you thought this is?\nWe talk this revolution shit, and not be super fit\nHow you gonna fight a battle soldier if you ain\u2019t used to it\nFizzy drinks, packet of crisps, chicken and chips\nNah fam, green banana and yam we go HAM\nMake your shit stand strong when you're still an old man\nCheck the Rastas in the hills back in Yard you\u2019ll understand\nWhat\u2019s the plan?\nKeep em dumb and distracted and unhealthy\nPerfect recipe for keeping themselves wealthy\nAnywho\nMurdering mics, daily I duppy, little yuppies, that's to scared of the trenches, I'm forever muddy\nA roadside brainiac, I\u2019ve forever studied\nCouple man mistook me for a prick, look what they discovered\nI tell jokes all the time, I\u2019m forever funny\nHa-bloody-Ha you really thought that I would let you mug it\nWe speak gully cause we're still tuggy\nThough we, deeper than gullys and we ruin countries\nAnd you, needn\u2019t have worry cause it's all covered\nLook how we, feeding them knowledge and they will love it\nYeeaah\nFuck your conditioning, rap nitroglycerine\nGlistening like the top of the pyramids on you invalids\nWe all know who the winner is, don\u2019t shit where your dinner is, Man rap about food but couldn\u2019t even finish his\nYou\u2019re hungry? I'm starving, look at my ribs inch\u2019ning\nThe baby n' it's bedtime, maybe I should sing to him\nA sweet little lullaby, put em to sleep\nIt's so peak for the other guy cause he ain\u2019t me\nMost of you speak 'bout the gully side and put me to sleep\nCause you\u2019re a chief and you cannot rhyme, better believe\nUncle Akala is the hardest out\nEverybody says this\nAnd it's no secret why I don\u2019t make playlist\nBut tour tickets selling out, novels self published\nMy life\u2019s all good, I enjoy my summers\nBut I am what I am, council house, single mother\nSo won\u2019t get arrogant from a little bit of abundance\nAs long as I puncture trying to manufacture dry schemes I\u2019m already done with\nRun through that stage in like seven, I'm on my shaolin monk shit\nOne finger push up, a blade in the neck\nIron shirt, qigong you can't fake the respect\nMuch less, [?] a vet, I'm as brave as cadet\nIn Dessalines army, what the fuck you expect?\nNEEEEEEXXXXT", "year": "2015-04-13", "album": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/d06fbbceadf997c411ad4da6be5f4952.1000x563x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Akala"}
