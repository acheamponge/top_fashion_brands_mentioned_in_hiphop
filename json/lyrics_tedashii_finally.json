Finally, I can see You, ohhhh\n\n[Verse 2: Tedashii]\nFinally, I can see You\nI heard 'em sayin' hang on, people will tell ya stay strong\nEncouragement is cool dependin' what it's based on\nPeople grippin empty wishes, hopin' for something different\nNo faith, no escape, who can I run to?\nWhen this world is a graveyard\nHere today, gone today, with no hope for tomorrow\nBut it's different for the children of God\nWe hold to every promise even when it gets hard\nNow can't compare to later, when we will see the Savior\nUntil we get to Heaven, I pray that He sustains us\nEmpty aim, unless it's in His name\nEven when I pass away my remains, remain\n\n[Hook]\nThis momentary trouble is a lot to own but I'm not alone, I'm not alone\nI'm moving to a city where the pain is gone, ohh, I'll be home (home)\n[x2]\n\n[Verse 3: Tedashii]\nEven if we held down, hang on to your happiness\nHopin' in His holiness and the fact He's compassionate\nEternal in perspective (huh) even in the rough times\nOnly for a moment (ahh) they could never shut us down\nMy pain is not pleasure, my grief is not joy\nBut both of them are in the fact that I'll see the LORD\nAnd so will everyone, born to blood and water\nSalvation's comin' so keep hopin' in the Father\n\n[Hook]\nThis momentary trouble is a lot to own but I'm not alone, I'm not alone\nI'm moving to a city where the pain is gone, ohh, I'll be home (home)\n[x2]\nHome... Finally, I can see You, ohhhh\nFinally, I can see You, ohhh [x5]"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
