Agh\nSmoke and fuck, we high as hell\nWe gon' love each other, we let the night derail\nOnly time will tell, I'm under your spell\nI lay on your chest, you wonder what's next\nI love when you breathe, it make me reflect\n\n[Chorus]\nI got Georgia on my mind, ain't nobody left behind\nIt's just me, my team, my weed, my baby's Audi parked outside\nCall my mom and let her know that everything is alright\nI got Georgia on my mind, ain't nobody left behind\nIt's just me, my team, my weed, my baby's Audi parked outside\nCall my mom and let her know that everything is alright\n(Everything you do is cool)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll of us in Jon's car\nPacked the trunk with merch, I was tryna be a star\nSame time I was cool with Uzi, dawg, my life felt like a movie\nI left my troubled home, Hollywood, what the fuck am I doing?\nI finally found peace, I suck when I get it\nI see worth in myself, I won't run away again\nI'm prayin' for my friends, they prayin' this won't end\nBut I know it does, just like all things\nIn the end, it's just me and my mood swings\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd the one-nine-nine (And the one-nine-nine-nine is comin')\nIs comin', is comin'\nAnd that one-nine-nine, boy (And the one-nine-nine-nine)\nOne-nine-nine is comin', is comin'\n(You know that it's comin')\n\n[Chorus]\nI got Georgia on my mind, ain't nobody left behind\nIt's just me, my team, my weed, my baby's Audi parked outside\nCall my mom and let her know that everything is alright\n(Everything you do is cool)\nI got Georgia on my mind, ain't nobody left behind\nIt's just me, my team, my weed, my baby's Audi parked outside\nCall my mom and let her know that everything is alright\n(Everything you do is cool)\nI got Georgia on my mind, ain't nobody left behind\nIt's just me, my team, my weed, my baby's Audi parked outside\nCall my mom and let her know that everything is alright\n(Everything you do is cool)\n\n[Outro]\nMy troubled home, Hollywood, what the fuck am I doing?\nYeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nMy troubled home, Hollywood, what the fuck am I doing?\nYeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"}], "artist": "Kevin Abstract"}
