Some of that tea...\n\nI know I sound raspy, but that's, hey, I used to go on tour, you know, and I'd be a prisoner. I used to be a prisoner on tour, cause I would go on tour, and tour you're supposed to enjoy and  have a good time, but I'd be this prisoner in a hotel, you know, drinking tea and, you know, telling the children, you know, \"Mommy has to sleep\" cause I wanted to maintain this, you know, immaculate sounding voice, but that's not realistic.\n\nYou know, reality is, sometimes I stay up late, and this is what I sound like when I wake up the next day, and you know, it's a voice.\n\nYou know, and to me, the more I, uh, I focus less on myself the more I realize I can be used to spread a message.Cause when I'm, I used to be so, oh my God, if I sound harsh and raspy I can't go out there.
