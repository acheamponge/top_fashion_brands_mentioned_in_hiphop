Try it\nYou might cause a riot\nWhat the radio won't play, the underground will supply it\nI'm a MC pirate, this loud not quiet\nRadical as they make, they make a rule I'll defy it\nCritics may say I'm wise, some may call my words lies\nI've lived more in one day than they will in their lives\nCops hate kids and kids hate cops\nCops kill kids with warning shots\nWhat is crime and what is not?\nWhat is justice? I think I forgot\nSqueeze The Trigger, 1986\nAin't a damn thing changed, motherfucker!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e31ea71297e7a9f7b5274df3c469e7d9.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Home Invasion", "year": "1993-03-23"}]}
