Charles Manson in the flesh\nAny last requests before you meet your maker?\nSow what you reap or wake up\nShakin' up a storm, like Anita Baker\nI'll take you straight to Hell and fill your heart with hate\nIncarcerate your fate in Satan's fiery lake, then I lock the gate\nMake no mistake, this shit as real as Joe\nWe follow the killer's code\nWhen we come for you, tell me: where will you go?\nNowhere to run, hide, I'll find you and silence your screams\nAnd even if you kill me, I'll still be in your fuckin' dreams\n\n[Chorus]\nYou ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk\nFrom New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk\nMark you for death\nWon't even talk that East or West crap\nFrom Watts to LeFrak\nIt ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou've made a grave mistake\nShouldn't have come here, you changed your fate\nYour brains'll make their debut on the table\nWhen I raise the stakes\nThe pain is great, but only for a second\nIt starts strong, then lessens\nJust when you restin', the Armaggedon sets in\nLeft him with so much stress (T.S.)\nBlessed him with no regrets, yes\nWelcome to Hell, son, the threshold of death\nFace the serpent, I blaze your person\nYou get laced for certain, leavin' Jakes no trace to work from\nClose the case like curtains\nI'm hurtin' heads severely, really tryin' to bring the pain\nThere's nothin' more satisfyin'\nThan when you cryin', screamin' my name\nIt's not a game, it's Purple Rain, floods of bloodstains\nBig Pun's my thug's name\nBustin' my guns, that's my love thang\nI'll slit your jug' vein and snatch your Adam's Apple\nJohn Madden-tackle your corpse\nTo hoist it on a cross at the tabernacle\nThat'll have to hurt, I'll work your body 'til it burst\nThen curse tu vida like a Brujer\u00eda verse\nI'm worse than anything you ever been through\nSick in the head and mental\nEssentially meant to be the sole threat against you\nWhen you awaken, your manhood'll be taken\nFakin' like you Satan, when I'm the rhymin' abomination\n\n[Chorus]\nYou ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk\nFrom New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk\nMark you for death\nWon't even talk that East or West crap\nFrom Watts to LeFrak\nIt ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat\nYou ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk\nFrom New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk\nMark you for death\nWon't even talk that East or West crap\nFrom Watts to LeFrak\nIt ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's hard to analyze which guys are spies; be advised, people\nWe recognize who lies, it's all in the eyes, chico\nWe read 'em and see 'em for what they are\nD's in undercover cars\nTakin' my picture like I'm a fuckin' star\nI'm up to par, my game is in a smash\nWith half a million in the stash\nPassport with the gats, first name and last\nAsk anybody if my men are rowdy\nGive me the mini-shottie\nI'll body a nigga for a penny probably\nI'm obligated to anything if it's crime-related\nIf it shine, I'll take it; still in my prime and I finally made it\nI hate the fact that I'm the last edition\nProperly a stats magician\nCould've went to college and been a mathematician\nBad decisions kept me out the game\nNow I'm strictly out for cream\nDoin' things to fiends I doubt you'll ever dream\nMy team's the meanest thing you ever seen\nMeasured by the Heaven's kings\nDown to the Devil's mezzanine\nI've never screamed so loud, I'm proud to be alive\nMost heads die by 25 or catch a quick three-to-five\nSo be advised: the street's full of surprises\nIt's not what crew's the livest\nOne that survive, it's who's the wisest\n\n[Chorus]\nYou ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk\nFrom New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk\nMark you for death\nWon't even talk that East or West crap\nFrom Watts to LeFrak\nIt ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat\nYou ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk\nFrom New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk\nMark you for death\nWon't even talk that East or West crap\nFrom Watts to LeFrak\nIt ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat\nYou ain't a killer..."}], "artist": "Big Pun"}
