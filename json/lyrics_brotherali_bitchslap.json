Till we get a equal cut\nWe come through straight smashin on the haters\nWitness the world, the Rhymesayers\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nOften the brain runs\nAnd expresses itself in words, sometimes profane ones\nThat's when it first occurred to me where the pain comes\nFrom, page one in my rhyme book\nIf you listen closely you can picture how my line looks\nYou presently pressed to be restin next to me\nThe best of me molestin destiny wrestlin with ecstacy\nThe recipe for immoratlity\nFlows actually be on the malls and factories\nOf urban life with the laws of gravity\nAudacity, you got a lot of it\nCommon sense should tell you not to rap against\nMy obvious dominance\nMy real life size is bigger than your confidence\nMan, fuck ya'll\n\n[ Hook ]", "year": "2003-05-02", "album": "Shadows on the Sun"}], "artist": "Brother Ali"}
