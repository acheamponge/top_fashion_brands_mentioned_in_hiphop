Left Foot in the motherfuckin' booth!\nLucious! Sir Lucious!\nSir Lucious Left Foot, has just entered\n\n[Hook]\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\n\n[Verse 1 - Big Boi]\nFirst rule in this thang: never let 'em see you sweat\nNever let 'em be a threat\nAnd your feelings you must protect 'em, as well as your rectum\nMust keep self out of harm, out of danger's way\nLet strangers play while you graduate and move on\nTrue happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale\nUnless you're in jail and trying to get a bail\nBondsman to go on and post that bail\nYou would be happy as hell\nYou thought you was happy until that court date came\nCouldn't abort that case\nNobody to take your place, family members at stake\nToo late to escape and get on the run\n\n[Hook]\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\n\n[Verse 2]\nOnce upon a rhyme one time when I was a child\n(Flip that smile upside down now!)\nWhen I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli\nIt was silly, 'cause my mom and pop, they worked for every penny\nDidn't have many but had enough to get by, enough to get fly\nOnly to start the New Year off in debt\nNow you forget your happiness came and went like mom and dad's relationship\nTake a trip, you bring potato chips, I'll bring the hot sauce!\n\n[Hook]\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\n\n[Verse 3]\n1979, Dirty South, local lounge\n(Flip that smile upside down now!)\nI never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness\nNow what done used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit\nGraphic, language, mild violence and the silence of the the fams\nNo members to remember but I know just who I am\nI've grown into a man and like my nigga said\nWe executed the game plan 'cause we got that hot sauce\n\n[Hook]\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\n(Flip that smile upside down now)\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\n(Flip that smile upside down now)\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked\nMight as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done\nWhen your goose is cooked", "image": "https://images.genius.com/547d6239cd014bda1acb0078d0ddaafc.999x999x1.jpg", "year": "2003-09-23", "title": "Unhappy", "album": "Speakerboxxx"}]}
