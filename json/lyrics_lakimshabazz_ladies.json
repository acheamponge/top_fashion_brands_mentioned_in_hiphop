A patch of it came out\nI was surprised, didn't wanna believe\nThat my hand had to feel honey girl's hair weave\nSo I chilled, I didn't get ill or rowdy\nSaid, \"See ya baby, I'm Audi like gowdy\"\nThought it was real but it was fake, see, I was blind\nYou never know what you find\nDealin' with\n\n[Chorus]\nLadies\nGot to have you lady, you sexy baby\nLadies\nBamboo earrings and things like that don't phase me\nLadies\nYes, I'm speakin' to the fly women of the world, peep it out\nLadies\nGimme a lady anytime and keep the fly girls\n\n[Verse 2: Lakim Shabazz]\nI like ladies that's light skinned, brown skinned\nThe tone of skin to me makes no difference\nI don't understand why some brothers frown\nWhen they're approached by a woman who's dark or brown skinned\nSome light skinned women think they're too good\nStay in the mirror all day and they think that they should\nFind a man who's much more darker than them\nWhy choose your man by the color of skin?\nI don't front, I tell straight facts\nWhat I say has a very strong impact\nI want you to know the eight shades of yellow\nEight shades of brown and it equals 16 shades of black\nYou need to wise up, cut out the bull crap\nWhoever told you that need to be slapped\nI don't smoke dust, not on a pipe or crack\nThe color of your skin to me doesn't mean jack\nBecause I know the right way to angle you\nMost women are swift and changeable\nListen up laides, see, I got a thing for you\nSo now I'ma [?] a few\nBecause I think it's 'bout time I let you know\nI'm into women, but I'm not a superhoe\nThey're so mysterious, there's somethin' about 'em\nYou can't live 'em and I can't live without 'em\n\n[Chorus]\nLadies\nGot to have you lady, you sexy baby\nLadies\nBamboo earrings and things like that don't phase me\nLadies\nYes, I'm speakin' to the fly women of the world, peep it out\nLadies\nGimme a lady anytime and keep the fly girls\nBreak it down\n\n[Verse 3: Lakim Shabazz]\nGet on the dance floor, make sure you don't trip\nDon't front now, I see you're pluckin' those lips\nGet a grip on a groove and don't slip\nShake it all around and roll your hips\nHourglass bodies that look sexy, sassy\nI'm the type that won't let a honey pass me\nI'm not a dog, my name's not Lassie\nEvery once in a while I feel kinda nasty\nCool and calm, composure's kept\nBut some honeys think I'm only out to get my thing wet\nMy main goal is to control your soul\nOn the dancefloor 'cause like Keith, I'll make you sweat\nBecause you're so tender\nLeavin' me breathless, so this message I send ya\nThey're so mysterious, there's somethin' about 'em\nYou can't live 'em and I can't live without\n\n[Chorus]\nLadies\nGot to have you lady, you sexy baby\nLadies\nBamboo earrings and things like that don't phase me\nLadies\nYes, I'm speakin' to the fly women of the world, peep it out\nLadies\nGimme a lady anytime and keep the fly girls\nLadies\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, you know what I'm sayin'?\nThis is how I feel about you ladies in the '90s\n'Cause y'all so sweet and tender\nSo I had to kick one out for you, yeah\nThis is Lakim Shabazz in full effect, 1990\nAnd like L.L. said, \"Small things are definitely behind me\"\nSee ya"}], "artist": "Lakim Shabazz"}
