Aw shit. Used to be whiter than [?]. Alright, so check it out, man. Let's smoke that weed and shit. What you talking 'bout weed and hoes? Yeah, I'm just sayin' like your strategy is good. Know what I'm sayin'? You got a lil get together goin' on, females comin' through, yeah, know what I mean? You know what I'm sayin'? They just like, you know, wanna concern the crowd 'cause you know...it, it, it don't give you a connoisseur like Marcel, aight. You have to have a lil stash on deck for you know, your activities and what not. You know they just gon' come through and smoke it all and it'll be gone in one night. Fuck that, you know what I'm sayin'? You just gotta have a lil bag of the good city vibes, you know what I'm sayin'? Lil stresser, you know what I'm sayin'? So when they come through, you know...she roll it up. Pass it all, you know what I'm sayin'? Man, you know if you keep to your side, you gon' roll a lil more chronic up, you know. And play at the same time, you know what I'm sayin'? You know all the weed come up together, you hear me?\nMan: Yo, you smell different\nXzibit: You just play it off, you be like, \"Nah, this the same shit I'm turnin'.\" Here, let me roll you another one. Bring that heat, you gon' pass that. C'mon, man, you gotta understand. Chronic keeping 101"}], "artist": "Xzibit"}
