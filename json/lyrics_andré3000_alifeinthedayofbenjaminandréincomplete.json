How's the lil' kid?\nShe was about two the last time we spoke\nI hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink\n'Cause I'd start the second album off on another note\nNow, that note threw some niggas in the hood off\nBut see, I'd balled out, and 'fore I'd fall out\nI'd slow my Lac down to a nice speed\nThe brain was that fried egg I might need\nNew direction was apparent\nI was a child looking at the floor, staring\nSo changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast\nYes, I was on the rise, yeast was the street\nTo make bread, never primary concern\nJust to hop on these beats and wait my turn\nI'd meet Muslims, gangstas, bitches, rastas\nAnd macaroni niggas, imposters\nSo on a trip to New York on some beeswax\nI get invited to a club where emcees at\nAnd on stage is a singer with some thing on her head\nSimilar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with\nWhich I was rocking at the time\nWhen I was going through them phases trying to find\nAnything that seemed real in the world\nStill searching, but I started liking this girl\nNow you know her as Erykah \"On and On\" Badu\nCall Tyrone on the phone, \"Why you\nDo that girl like that, boy? You ought to be ashamed\"\nThe song wasn't about me and that ain't my name\nWe're young, in love, in short we had fun\nNo regrets, no abortion, had a son\nBy the name of Seven, and he's five\nBy the time I do this mix, he'll probably be six\nYou do the arithmetic, me do the language arts\nY'all stand against the wall blindfolded, we throw the darts\nTo poke you in the heart and take you from the start\nTo when luxury transportation meant a MARTA card\nOr either when your girlfriend that went to Mays\nMama or her daddy let her borrow the Benz, because she's smart\nOr maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor\nAnd he sells you that Rabbit that's been sitting in his yard\nYou fix it up, you trick it out, you give it rims, you give it bump\nYou give it all your time because that's all you can think about\nAnd that's as far as I got\n(*music fades*)\n\n[Radio Interview]\nAnd that's as far as I got, and where I wanted to go\nKnowing the whole summer that's all you could think about\nEven though if you cut it off and start that bitch up\nYou need a jump, like your need and your want to grow\nAnd you change all the time\nSo that Rabbit that you thought about that whole summer\nThe next summer, you didn't want that Rabbit no more\nYou wanted something bigger and better\n\"So the summer passed and now the Rabbit's old?\"\nRight... right, so now you want a Cadillac..."}], "artist": "Andr\u00e9 3000"}
