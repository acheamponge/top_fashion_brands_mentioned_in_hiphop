Fuck what it pays me\nI don't want to live my life safe-ly\nBut I don't think there people that I work with seem to understand that every time I come up in the office, that the motha-fuckin gun up in my pocket is off safety\nI need to go to the beach and relax, take a nice, warm sun shower\nCongratulations, you got off work\nNow you gotta deal with rush-hour\nWho the hell lied to society and said that, this is right and  said this is life and said, if you wanna have a nice kids and wife\nIt's all sleepless nights and all senseless fights and all..\n\n\n(Chorus)\nSleepless nights. Senseless fights.(x8)\n\n(Verse 2)\nSo perfect\nIf I make 10 million dollars those fancy cars, and that jewelry, I won't purchase\nI'll move my family to the woods and buy a cabin and communicate through only post service\nSo the problem, stress, drama, and mess of everyday life won't surface\nI know so many people that have graduated college and they sit around out of work, biiitch\nI know so many people that are 25 and older and they just feel downright worth-less\nI wish that I can tell you that there's gonna be a day where the adult life bullshit we deal with'll all stop\nBut we start over the cycle on the December the thrity-first a new years eve the very second that the ball dropped\nOne last breath\nThe sooner that you realize that every one of us is crazy is the sooner you can find a little symmetry\nAnd try to direct your energy to all the little things you go through daily\nAnd the Universe it never will apologize for making you experience the things you've experienced\nI think the biggest fear is that it's really all for nothing, man, I'm serious\nI'm sick of always wakin' up and dealing with the feelings of the..\n\n(Chorus)\nSleepless nights.
