Now only I can hear\nLonely with ire some iron irises eyes are here\nThey match like, sisters in Shining stairs\nCut with the bicuspids, scissors incisor shears\nI kissed her lips and left a blister\nBliss turned into miser-returned into twister\nTwister turned to blizzard\nBlizzard burned and turned to flood to wash away the winter\nAnd since I've learned to search the mud & walked away the victor\nAnd now so muddy, bloody\nI'm nobody, with no buddies\nThorns grow with no budding\nThere's no sunny, just ho-humming\nThe low notes in solo, I'm so lone at home with no ghosts\n\n[Hook](2x)\nI'm out the dark, I'm out the dark, I'm out the dark\nI'm out the dark, somebody let some light in here\nI'm out the dark, I'm out the dark, I'm out the dark\nI'm out the dark, I bring the fire here\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm out the dark, fingers think they're spider limbs\nCrawl around her body, sink inside her skin\nThey place their eggs inside, creating aches & sighs\nDon't exorcise my demons make em extra-sized\nThey say the devil lies in scripture\nI say the devil lies in scripture\nSo picture this image is grim but I can't say it's brightening\nAlthough the lightless days are lightening\nBut not like light the way light lightning, strike!\nMore light lighten weight like lightening\nI tried to sing imprisoned once, but that thought was for the birds\nI wanted to be fly so I thought about the birds\nWhere will they be heading as they soared through the air?\nI watched a beheading swing a sword through the heir\nAcquiring the crown is a sordid affair\nSo I sorted through the fair and found a spark\nI'm out of body, out of mind, I'm\u2026\n\n[Hook](2x)\nI'm out the dark, I'm out the dark, I'm out the dark\nI'm out the dark, somebody let some light in here\nI'm out the dark, I'm out the dark, I'm out the dark\nI'm out the dark, I bring the fire here", "album": "Salo Sessions"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
