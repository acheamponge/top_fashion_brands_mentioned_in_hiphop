Don't we?\nWe all get hurt sometimes. Don't we?\nWe all laugh sometimes. Don't we?\nWe often pass the time. Don't we?\nWe all get mad sometimes. Don't we?\nWe all can flash at times. Can't we?\nHave some peace of mind?\nDon't we need to seize the time? Don't we?\nLife is FUCKED up\nBut it can be\nSome people just lucked up\nBecause they can see\nThe shit is chaotic in disguise\nGuns and narcotics for our demise\nAnd don't forget the lies\nThey pump you with\nI rise to the occasion without a scratch or abrasion\nJust a hop, skip, and jump\nAway from a rock hit and a drunk\nNo loitering here\nAye y'all can't hang out after dark here\nExcuse me sir, but you can't park here!\nI mean tell your dogs that they can't bark here\nI mean the world is moving baby\nBut you gotta just Hold on\nBut Sometimes you can't just hold on\nYou gotta just let it go\nLet, let, let, let, let it go", "title": "The Hurt", "album": "A Book Of Human Language", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c348dfe824da4f3b04231c7e4d629ae.700x700x1.jpg", "year": "1998-04-14"}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
