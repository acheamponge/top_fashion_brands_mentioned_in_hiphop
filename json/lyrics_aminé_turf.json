A-a-and then...)\n\n[Bridge (Spoken): Amin\u00e9]\nI slip and slide through the times in my youth\nWhat's age? Too young to worry, too old to dream\nWhat's age? Imagination to me, tragedy to some\nWhat's age? I guess we'll find out when we're older. Touch\u00e9\n\n[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Amin\u00e9]\nI look around and I see nothing in my neighborhood\nNot satisfied, don't think I'll ever wanna stay for good\nPacked up my bags, told Mom and Dad I've gotta go, go\nAnd once I do, they'll finally see the inner me\n\n[Outro: Charlie Wilson]\nOh\nOoh, oh, ooh, oh yeah\nOoh, ooh, oh yeah, ooh\nYeah-eah-eah-eah-eah\nOo yeah-eah-eah-eah\nOhhhh hmm\nOhhhh hmm\nHmm\nHmm\n(Turf)"}]}
