{"songs": [{"lyrics": "In front of the mic, behind the limelight\nA star so bright shines refined advancement\nDance with the last man on the face of the earth\nWho did the electric sl-i-i-ide over the verse\nHands held high, connect the antennas\nDo or die when we fly, face the grimace\nYeah let's get this off you ready, Fast Eddie\nDrop a load on 'em, wrong folks got a hold on 'em\nPut the Blowed on 'em, roll on 'em\nRoll over 'em, no control over 'em, over me\nOutwardly, inwardly, openly, awkwardly\nHappily, dastardly, tragedy and casualty\nSame story same flight\nWhere they put yo' body same strip same spite, same endin\nSame car, same endin, same tension brewin\nGive me the steel, what the FUCK is you doin?\nYou done enough it's not enough, act two\nI'm runnin up it's not a bluff, I'm bout to crack you\nNonchalant, idiots about no comp\nRomp, with the big guys, stomp all the pies\nKick the box, light these M-80's\nLadies grab your babies, run for safety\nI don't think it may be a, good idea to stand here\nYou have no idea of what the FUCK'S about to land here\nSmart bombs, J-DAMS, bring mayhem\nHold up, god damn, it's just a party\nDirty red carpet and you walk by me wobbly\nObviously, oblivious, frontin snobby\nHeat to the Mojave, heat to the robbery\nBeat, to the rhymin, each, brother probably\nTaxpayers killer the mayor, and the senator\nRhyme sayers say a prayer, see a minister\nDrinks are on the house, the house is on the hill\nThe hills are on FIRE, it started in the fields\nSmoke inhalation, no ventilation\nNo fire station, no assimilation\nMinus the heroes and plaques memorial sites\nBecome burial sites, from high aerial flights\nHover over David Blaine, I'm here to save the game\nFifty-two pick-up witcha brain\nAlone lies the man on the track\nLonely as the dagger in my back, staggerin fowards\nFallin face flat, still spittin at you\nStill gettin at you, they're all laughin at you\nMy greatest gift of all was the ability to fall\nGet back up and fall, get back up and fall\nGet back up and fall and crawl and get back up and brawl\nAnd make 'em lick the balls\nNow the dagger's in my back pocket, I hear the track I rock it\nPull your arm outta socket, reachin for the cockpit\nRock shit, roll shit, control shit\nHold shit down 'til we slow on some old shit\nI'll stick the pin in your neck just to earn respect\nStuff the paper in your mouth if I have to spell it out\nOr write it on yo' forehead cause that's what I'm about\nRun the route, bring water to the drought\nWhen all else fails on the trails of love\nHate becomes judged, happiness won't budge\nWickedness does just as wickedness does\nAnd I'm just gettin above, I'm sayin it just because I can\nJust because I am a man\nWith the, hand that fit it and the teeth marks embedded\nBut God's hands, grip tight, and don't forget it\nThe evil in your heart is, misery's home\nWhere ugly is bred and grown, I refuse\nI defuse the bomb but just for a moment\nAnd like out of NOWHERE comes yo' worst opponent\nThe first ones on it, the last to leave\nAll my, trash is treasure, that's how it's perceived\nAt the end of my spin when the heights achieved\nI'mma leave with a bang like how I was conceived\nThere's thieves in the temple with tricks up they sleeve\nBUT NO!!! FUCK THAT!!\n\n{*\"No\" repeats, echoes, distorts, and fades*}", "title": "Takeoff", "album": "Love and Hate", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8aabb2266f1dc21cbed33421bd2b76e2.220x220x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
