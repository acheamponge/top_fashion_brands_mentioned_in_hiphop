Yuh\n\n[Chorus]\nYou think rollin' with a piece gon' get you yo' peace back?\nYou fuckin' these hoes, but they fuckin' you back every time you turn yo' back\nSuicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac\nSuicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac\nYou think rollin' with a piece gon' get you yo' peace back?\nYou fuckin' these hoes, but they fuckin' you back every time you turn yo' back\nSuicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac\nSuicidal thoughts in the back of the Cadillac\n\n[Outro]\nYuh (Yuh), yuh (Yuh), yuh (Yuh), yuh\nYuh (Yuh), yuh (Yuh), yuh (Yuh), bitch (Bitch)", "year": "2015-03-25"}]}
