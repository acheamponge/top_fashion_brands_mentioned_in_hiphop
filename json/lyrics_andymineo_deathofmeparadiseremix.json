the death of me\nDeath of me, death of me\nMe, me, me, me\n\n[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]\nYeah, pocket full of boarding passes\nI don't know what city I was in last\nBut I'm out here tryna make a impact\nSame time keep myself intact\nThey say, \"Take it, take it easy A like it's gym class\"\nTell me how I could?\nThere's slaves in the world, before I die, tryna see us end that\nSo I move fast, Ramadan\nMove fast, Autobahn\nWho cares if I ever get a Grammy nom\nIf my soul take L's, phenomenon\nStill can't believe I get paid for this\nAs a kid, all I did was pray for this\nNow I'm livin' out my dream, craziest\nGot me really feelin' like I was made for this\nAt the same time never knew how dangerous\nIt could be when lives start getting changed to this\nWhen somebody say you they favourite\nGuess it carry some weight to it\nYou know, 'cause uh\nThat's power and that's influence\nThe temptation is to use it for myself and serve somebody else\nI'm sittin' here buggin' just rememberin' what them rappers showed me\nHow to bag a honey, stack the money\nThey said I was a mac by the number of shorties that I could smash\nNow I'm waitin' on that matrimony\nCause I've been changed up\nLil' homie came up\nIt's depressin', kickin' it with dudes I used to look up to\nThey still on that same stuff, what!?\n\n[Refrain: Andy Mineo]\nI ain't have no role models, now I gotta be one\nI bought the lie hip-hop sold me, man I want a refund\n\n[Hook: Andy Mineo & (Chris Martin)]\nI feel like it's the real me, feel me?\nYeah, I been changed, but I'm still me\nWhat I am now, not what I will be\nI'm tryna give life\nBut this could be the death of me\n(Para, para, paradise)\nThe death of me\n(Para, para, paradise)\nThis could be the death of me\n(Para, para, paradise)\nJust trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n(Para, para, paradise)\nThe death of me\nThis could be the death of me\n(Oh whoa, oh whoa)\nJust trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n(Para, para, paradise)\nLook, death of me\nThis could be the death of me\n(Para, para, paradise)\nJust trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n(Para, para, paradise)\nDeath of me\nThis could be the death of me\n(Para, para, paradise)\nJust trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]\nLook, mama feel like she losin' me\nTo this lifestyle that's consumin' me\nI travel every weekend even when I'm weak man\nYou know what that to do to me?\nBack pain, back pain\nSleepin' on planes, I'm feelin' like Bruce Wayne\nBlackout at night on that stage\nMan I need a batcave just to get away\nJesus retreated, woo!\nTo speak with his Father, I know that I need it\nMy career been growin'\nBut tell me where I'm goin' if my time with God is depleted\nGod I'm sorry, I mean it\nAll I want to do is walk with you, but\nMy priorities wrong, I talk about you more than I talk with you\nOne of my mentors taught me whenever things get foggy\nIf you wanna grow in God it's not complicated it's just costly\nGotta spend that time, currency\nOvertime guess I learned to be\nStrong enough to admit I'm weak\nTo meet with God all I need is me\n2014 'bout to be different\nI think my favorite word'll be no\nOpportunities come and they go\nBut none of them is worth my soul\nThat's somethin' that you can't afford\nAnd got me thinkin' what's most important\nI get kicks, watchin' grown men in line for some Jordans\nNowadays time is fortune\nBut chasin' fortune is all consumin'\nI feel like God's callin' dudes\nThey just wanna play Call of Duty *gun shots*\nThis that Peter Pan, at the dinner table out in Never Land\nEatin', can't nobody see it but me and my boys\nThat's the way I wanna keep it\nI lost a couple friends to this new season\nJealousy and hate for a few reasons\nUsed to be down, now what's up?\nGuess everybody around when the fun's up, yup\nGot me feelin' isolated (yeah)\nWomen wanna holla, I just tell em' that I'm taken (yeah)\nEven if I wasn't I'd be slow for the taking\nI'll know if they love me or the money I'm making (I don't know)\nAin't no way to really tell\nWhere somebody heart truly at\nBad girls comin' at me looking good\nShowin' off they body that's a booby trap\nBeard low, but I never let my guard down\nBuddy, I ain't crazy\nYou ain't bout' to catch me slippin'\nPull a Million Dollar Baby!\nMe and Dre trying to eat good\nCuttin' out the nonsense\nOn the road trying to give life\nBut I might lose mine in the process\n\n[Refrain: Andy Mineo]\nI ain't have no role models, now I gotta be one\nI bought the lie hip-hop sold me, man I want a refund\nI feel like\nFund, I feel like\nFund, I feel like\nFund, I feel like\nFund, I feel like\nFund, I feel like\nFund, I feel like\n\n[Hook: Andy Mineo & (Chris Martin)]\n(Para, para, paradise)\nThe death of me\nThis could be the death of me, uh\n(Para, para, paradise)\nJust trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n(Para, para, paradise)\nThe death of me\nThis could be the death of me\n(Oh whoa, oh whoa)\nJust trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n(Para, para, paradise)\nLook, death of me\nThis could be the death of me\n(Para, para, paradise)\nJust trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n(Para, para, paradise)\nDeath of me\nThis could be the death of me\n(Para, para, paradise)\nJust trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nLook"}]}
