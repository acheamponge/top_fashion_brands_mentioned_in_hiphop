He's out of here\n\n[Verse 1]\nAntoinette is back from hibernation\nI'm in tune so please don't change the station\n[?]\n'Cause the boss' job is never done\nSo if you think I'm scrounging and lounging\nYou're bugging, you better plug in, 'cause I'm drugging\nJust like Doctor Who in your bloodstream\nCaptivating atmospheres with a death beam\nNow those who slept or those with nightmares\nAwaken, peep it through, and I'm right here\nThe operation, Antoinette is heard\n...and that's word\n\n[Hook]\nShe operates around the clock\nSo don't you ever sleep\n\n[Verse 2]\nRaise your hands to God, and feel blessed\nMisbelieve, you're face to face with death\nOr should I live and let die, 'cause you're sniffin'\nWith the nerve to bitch about the heat inside the kitchen\nYour lots are low, and yo\nI'll take the advice, you follow with nothing but foul play\nAnd now you can know the truth to spread the deal\n(Did somebody say \"deal\"?) Damn real\nYour eyes are closed, supposed to see 'em\nAnd the posse I roll with is one supreme bein'\nSo bring your big bad wolf and I'ma blow up\nWe'll take no shorts, so don't even show up\nI got a purpose to serve, and I'm servin' it\nTry to take mines and your loss will be permanent\nOnce again my operation's heard\n...and that's word\n\n[Hook]\nShe operates around the clock\nSo don't you ever sleep\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow, a Buddha will bless, a teacher will teach\nAnd since I got the gift speech, yo I'ma speak\nAnd as I speak, you stand there, yeah what\nI'm watching you fade like a flat-top haircut\nBut I'm not ready to go out, I'm ready to blow up\nSo make like it's *20 Below* and freeze\nAs I prepare to rap again\nTeach to those who can't read or rip\nNow here we go, here we go, on a new search\nAs the Gangstress gives birth\nSo pamper life, don't scamper\nTHOSE WHO TAMPER GET THROWN IN A HAMPER\nNow once again my operation's heard\n...and that's word", "year": null}]}
