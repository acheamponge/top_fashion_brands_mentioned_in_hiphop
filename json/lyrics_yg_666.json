These kids Lord, they playing with all these guns and drugs, they remind me when I was young. See, in the 80s, we didn't play that shit. But we was crack babies. No Lord, I'm not no hypocrite, I'm just an old motherfucker, tryna save some shit. Lord, I ask my son \"Why it is just thugs he hang out with?\" He looked at me and said \"Pops, I'm staying dangerous.\" Help me Lord, I tried to tell him there are many ways to stay dangerous. Power is dangerous, knowledge is dangerous, having them dollars is dangerous. He just looked at me Lord and said \"Pops, I'm talking dangerous.\"", "title": "666"}]}
