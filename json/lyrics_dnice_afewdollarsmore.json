{"songs": [{"lyrics": "I grew up in the city where everything is rough\nWhere everywhere I turn, I seen somebody gettin bust\nPlus everywhere I look\nAll I could see is a crackhead or a goddamned crook\nRunnin' around with a pistol or a blade\nStickin' up -- in other words, gettin' paid\nBut I chose not to follow those ways\nCause the only place you headin' is to jail or the grave\nBut on the other hand\nI know a man named Stan\nWho in the future had plans\nTo be successful on his quest to\nTake his moms and pops out the ghetto\nBut that plan was soon to be crushed\nWhen one day he realized he must\nGet a better job to pay for his schoolin\nWhile his friends would sit around just coolin\nHe applied for a job in the system\nAnd everywhere he looked, everybody would diss him\nHe doesn't have any type of skill\nAnd life is not all games, it's real\nHe took a long walk down the street\nTryin' to think of a way to make his ends meet, huh\nSo he could buy the fly things he adored\nAnd all Stan wanted to make was a few dollars more\nAs he walked home, he thought to himself\nNow what am I supposed to do to get wealth\nHe felt that his life was worthless\nThen he ran into his man named Curtis\nNow Curtis, he's the type that stops and brags\nAbout all the things he's got\nDrivin' a Saab with a black ragtop\nCome to find out Curt's workin' for the cops\nHe told Stan there's a job that's open\nMakin' it all sound good, just hopin he would take it\nYup, and like a big dummy\nStan said \"Freak it, yo, I need the money\"\nCurt took Stan to meet his boss\nOfficer Sims, a sergeant on the force\nHe gave him a gun and Stan began\nHis new career as a damn hit man\nHis boss really liked his work\nAnd gave the boot to his partner Curt\nHe didn't realize what he was in for\nAnd all Stan wanted to make was a few dollars more\nA few dollars more is what he started to make\nNow he's drivin' around a Saab, with a house upstate\nHe got gold and diamond rings\nCrazy girls and all those glamorous things\nBut one day this life-style end\nWhen one afternoon while hangin' with a friend\nSittin' in the park, drinkin' quarts of beer\nAnd somebody said \"Throw your hands in the air\nIt's a stick-up\" and put the gun to his head\nAnd said, \"Make another move and you're dead\"\nNow Stan had to make is choice\nHe paused and said I recognize that voice\nHuh, where have I heard this\nNow he remember, it's his man named Curtis\nCurtis is mad and felt he'd been robbed\n\"Cause Stan is drivin' around in his Saab\nHe looked at Stan and said, \"I can't believe him\nNow its' time for me to get even\"\nStan made a move real quick\nCurt jumped back and said, \"Yo, that's it\"\nShot him in the back of his head with a nine\nReached in his pocket, grabbed his cash and then dashed\nNow here lies the man on the side\nThe same way he lived was the same way he died\nHe never knew what he had in store\nAnd all Stan wanted to make was a few dollars more", "album": "Call Me D-Nice", "year": null, "title": "A Few Dollars More", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eb0cb470ed0037a539adc0b84eb90ebd.432x432x1.jpg"}], "artist": "D Nice"}
