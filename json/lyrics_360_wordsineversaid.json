You get my piece hungry, like my last meal\nBut forget my priest, look\nI ain't dying, I'm fighting to live\nThe only real fight that I gotta win is the fight in my head\nAnd such is life, Cay-sa-ra-sa-rah mafucker\nI'm on my grind mafucker, and such is life\nFor us generation F.L.Y\nSo stay tuned, the revolution gon' be televised\nIn the comfort of ya living room, watching us falling\nFly and find out what a mafucking milli' do\nYeah, so we'll see you when we touch down\nMatter fact, fuck that, we ain't gonna come down\n\n[Chorus: Skylar Grey (Sampled)]\nIt's so loud inside my head\nWith words that I should have said\nAs I drown in my regrets\nI can't take back the words I never said"}]}
