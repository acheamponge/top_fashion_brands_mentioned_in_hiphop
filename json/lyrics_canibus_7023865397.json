Listening Party on December 14th, 2006. There are two voices.]\nVoice 1: \"Yo, the niggas that use to have a nigga a little nervous was like; B.I.G., 'Pac...\"\nVoice 2: \"Right\"\nVoice 1: \"...Even Canibus, like, Eminem but them niggas got me like...\"\nVoice 2: \"If we go at it dawg we gotta go HARD!\"\n\n\"Voice 1: \"Yo, the niggas that use to have a nigga a little nervous was like; B.I.G., 'Pac...\"\nVoice 2: \"Right\"\nVoice 1: \"...Even Canibus, like, Eminem but them niggas got me like...\"\nVoice 2: \"If we go at it dawg we gotta go HARD!\"\n\n[Canibus]\nYea, yo\nI support a secure change of custody\nDon't trust the beat, trust me Canibus the emcee\nWithout moving my neck I turn to the left\nYes I am the best, you will learn to respect\nTill your death, Hip-Hop is the body, you are the chest\nI am the vest, we are sworn to protect\nThis behavioral bomb, rewritable radio songs\n\"What station is your radio on?\"\nMy training is worth millions\nImam death squads rush the building\nFrom the front line with Prince William\nI am Prince Williams, exercise cover and concealment\nProhibit the media from filming\nNever in the moment, always thinking of the Omen\nOur poor soldiers, nobody told them\nInoculate; I postulate not to wait\nDrop to your face, the active component will not break\nMy Armenian friend tried to pay me in Yen\nI threw the money in his face and said \"Pay me again\"\nYou wanna talk to the kid? Enter this ten digit grid\nI'll explain to you what I did\n702-386-5397, call, leave a message\nY'all niggas can't rap, so why you wanna go and do that?\nYou move the crowd, I move the map\nThe defiant mad Lion, triumph over the rulers of Zion\nFuck your Blood Diamonds, I'd rather laugh dying\nMiners in the mine shaft crying\n'Apocalypto' from GITMO, I'll clash with the last Mayans\nThe Sun stone science, the black, red and blue alliance\nJump through the fire, you'd be a fool to try it\nThe fire suit don't fit, NO SHIT!\nMy Saratoga suit got a customized grip\nWith a batwing released for both wrist and both feet\nBlazing hot, but I don't feel no heat\nHip-Hop's master chief, \"Here, have a seat\"\nIn the mic booth where I hang slabs of meat\nBefore, during, or after the debrief\nI'll crack your teeth, don't talk unless you asked to speak\nThe Rift Valley Fever symptoms could last for weeks\nWe call it hell in a cell, watch the bastard tweak\nReach 80\u00b0 degrees North, 14\u00b0 degrees East\nBeneath the ice sheet lies the Spitsberg Beast\nTransmission distorted, injuries reported\nMission aborted, follow your orders, move forward\nBRAVO! I fell in love with Suzanne Malveaux\nOn the down-low, now you know\nShe talked to the Canibus man\nCode name: Javelin Fangz\nWith 'Nothing to Prove' to the rap fans\nCould elaborate further but suffice to say\n\"Goddamn that emcee made my day\"\nHe's a butcher, a baker, a vapor box maker from Jamaica\nStill talking trash to the haters\nI'll clash with the greatest, this is major manual labor\nBeta test the data with blue lasers\nCanibus wave analysis, it's 'Nothing to Lose' in Los Angeles\nSuing Hip-Hop for the damages\nG-4's, 10.4's, still conscious but not for long\nMissile lock-on; stop the song"}]}
