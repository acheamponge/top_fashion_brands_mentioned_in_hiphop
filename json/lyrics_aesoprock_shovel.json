{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Hook]\nI don't shrug. I study the ramifications of my shovel\nLoving the consequence of uprooting the jungle\nI'm hugging the cycle of Gemini's duplicate tenants for muting the puzzle\nI don't budge the motives\nEncased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas\nI don't shrug. I study the ramifications of my shovel\nLoving the consequence of uprooting the jungle\nI'm hugging the cycle of Gemini's duplicate tenants for muting the puzzle\nI don't budge the motives\nEncased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas\n\n[Verse 1]\nMy kitchen sink leaks like you're itching to speak your secret\n'bout the world spins yet nobody's pledged allegiance and why\nHis beaming smile knew a private agony that burns\nAnd when the children met divinity I sat to watch the merge\nIt goes pandemonium live\nYa'll mutha fuckers stand up. Volunteer tantrums while your plan sunk, vivid\nPlay your sympathy card, son of misery classed with\nThe basket cases is in a classless matrix with elastic patience\nI zig in a zagging only zone\nDraggin a bag of lonely poem remnants\nShort of breath like you're short of fresh\nYou're a portable mess\nCarpetbagger spearheading tear peddeling pretentious art critics, orphans\nTrying to dismiss those pioneering their fortunes\nYou're a spectacle\nPushin for pedagogue lacin up paper weights walkin on stilts talking\nYou touched the hand of God and I'm like\nWhat are all these evils that plagued the hearts of man\nBy sweet talking border patrol until they fold and let them in\nYou got your life in a basket before you could say instant classic\nLike the king of the mountain requires a boost\nI'll bury the hook in my belly just to volunteer at live bait clinics\nFor the thrill of 9 great mimics with 18 bloody lips, spittin\nBeanstalk, chalking outlines before figures fly\nWalking uphill trying to get down\nProminent ghost town litigate battle pitch darkness\nWhen the light switch hits the artistry circuit board breaker\nServicing the greater half of nature\nSee money go wild shook when the exploitation incubated lovely\nWarmingly piggy leader colony to comfort\nNumb enough to deny the sin pins and evil needles even punctured\nTill he woke to find his tourniquet still functions\n\n[Hook]\nI don't shrug. I study the ramifications of my shovel\nLoving the consequence of uprooting the jungle\nI'm hugging the cycle of Gemini's duplicate tenants for muting the puzzle\nI don't budge the motives\nEncased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas\nI don't shrug.

I study the ramifications of my shovel\nLoving the consequence of uprooting the jungle\nI'm hugging the cycle of Gemini's duplicate tenants for muting the puzzle\nI don't budge the motives\nEncased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas\nI don't shrug.
