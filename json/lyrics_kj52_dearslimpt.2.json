disrespected\nBut if I die today and never sell another record\nJesus gave me more than I ever could of been expected\nI know life is hectic, it can leave you blown away\nBut check it bro cause we all just gonna die someday\nAnd on that note, well, there's only one thing left to say\nThere's still one love and one god and only one way\n\n[Hook x2]\nLa la la la la la la la\nLa la la la la la la la la\nTo whom it may concern\nLa la la la la la la la\nLa la la la la la la la la\nStill, to whom it may concern\nLa la la la la la la la\nLa la la la la la la la la\nTo whom it may concern\nLa la la la la la la la\nLa la la la la la la la la\nIt's still, to whom it may concern\n\nLa la la la la la la la\nLa la la la la la la la la\nTo whom it may concern\nLa la la la la la la la\nLa la la la la la la la la\nStill, to whom it may concern\nLa la la la la la la la\nLa la la la la la la la la\nTo whom it may concern\nLa la la la la la la la\nLa la la la la la la la la\nIt's still, to whom it may concern"}]}
