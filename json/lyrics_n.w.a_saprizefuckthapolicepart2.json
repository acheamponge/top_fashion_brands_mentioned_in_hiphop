Put the joint out!\nHey you motherfuckers want to step out of the car?\nDon't you know it's against the law to play music so god damn loud?\nShut the fuck up! Go to jail? Or gimme that shit you was just smoking\n\nMotherfuckers from high crime areas view the police as a threat\nAnd that's some shit you betta not forget\n\n[Verse 2: Eazy-E]\nEazy E's the name feared by most\nWhen, a lil nigga is thrown in the pen\nBut on the streets there's two kinds of people\nWhite rich fucks and the ones who get harassed like me\nPull over to the side, routine for me\nTearin' up my shit, like they lookin for a key of cocaine\nBut they never find the shit\nAin't got nuttin better to do and nobody else to fuck wit\nThinkin' everything is stolen\nBut can't face facts that a young black nigga's just rollin\nMaking more money than they ever make\nTaking more shit than they ever take\nYo pigs are made to kill, and no regret and\nKeep your hand on your weapon shoot his ass and start steppin\nCause I'm a nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin\nSo let me explain a lil somethin, yo\n\nSee, I got this problem, a big problem...\nCops don't like me, so I don't like motherfucking cops\n\n[Hook]\n\nEpisode Two:\nGet out of the fuckin car!\nWait a god damn minute what the hell did I do?\nHey just shut the fuck up black bitch\nWait a minute, you ain't gotta be pullin me by my motherfuckin hair!

The excuse to shoot, or they rather stomp your head\nTil you're dead with the steel-toe boot\nHarassin me with some kind of mind game\nActin like a nigga just was born with a gang-name\nYou call that right but when you're black there's no right\nSome recreational shit was only a gang fight\nSo shootin at the cops was a street thing\nTo waste time as we slanged off the cocaine\nBut everything was done just for peace\nTo retaliate, on the fuckin police, so I'm sayin\n\n[Hook]\n\n(The final episode)\n\nEpisode Three:\nHey Juan, look at the piece of ass man\nWatch out watch out watch out homes!\nOh shit man you fucked up, you hit a police car\nI didn't see that piece of caca!\nBetter act like you don't speak ingles homes\nWhat the fuck? Get your ass out of there, I've had enough\nOf your raggedy ass motherfucking shit!\nOh man no me pegues! por que me pegas? No! por favor no! No!
