Oh really, no doubt, no diggity\nSpittin that East Coast straight talk so wickedly\nAuthentic b-boy hip-hop, no trickery\nThat's why my 16 bar scheme so slippery\nFuck at least one broad a day\nAnd like Chingy, I'm only one call away\nSo if you're tired of the norm and you want more tricks\nDial 373-2146\nAnd I'm there..\n\n[Hook]\nI'm getting good, I'm getting clever\nI'm getting things right in my life, I'm getting better\nI'm getting something for me, I'm getting cheddar\nThe girls are loving me now, they're getting wetter\n\n[Hook]\nI'm getting good, I'm getting clever\nI'm getting things right in my life, I'm getting better\nI'm getting something for me, I'm getting cheddar\nThe girls are loving me now, they're getting wetter\n\n[Bridge]\nSay it with me\nI'mma just push and push until I get it\nI'mma just push and push until I get it\nI'mma just push and push until I get it\nSuicide doors, G4's, and good credit\n\n[Bridge]\nSay it with me\nI'mma just push and push until I get it\nI'mma just push and push until I get it\nI'mma just push and push until I get it\nSuicide doors, G4's, and good credit\n\n[Verse 3]\nBefore I pull up and park and bust in your apartment\nI'mma just perm my hair like Al Sharpton\nAnd get a picket sign just to protest your flow next\nYour little pussy rhymes need Kotex\nThere's mad little tricks hittin' up in my sleeve\nDon't be naive I'll have you screamin' out \"Why me?\"\nYou soft motherfuckers come a dozen a dime\nI'll fuck you up and walk off like it wasn't a crime\nStick my gun where the sun don't shine\nHave you fuckin' a nine\nHave sodomy stuck in your mind\nYou'll probably want revenge\nSneak up on me, stick a knife in my back\nTake naked pictures of my body like they did in Iraq\nAnd then, wake up sweaty in a puddle of piss\nI'll fuckin', bust your shit, call your brother a bitch\nAnd then leave you where I met you brother, holdin' your mouth\nHoldin' your jaw in awe, nigga, over and out\n\n[Hook]\nI'm getting good, I'm getting clever\nI'm getting things right in my life, I'm getting better\nI'm getting something for me, I'm getting cheddar\nThe girls are loving me now, they're getting wetter\n\n[Hook]\nI'm getting good, I'm getting clever\nI'm getting things right in my life, I'm getting better\nI'm getting something for me, I'm getting cheddar\nThe girls are loving me now, they're getting wetter", "year": "2008-07-20"}]}
