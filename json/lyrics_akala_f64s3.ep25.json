{"songs": [{"title": "F64 S3.EP25", "lyrics": "Michael was another that lived without the love of a mother nor the other\nNot the story of a brother not using a rubber\nFather was a militant Rasta back in the early 80\u2032s\nLicked banks built hood schools so you could learn your babies\nOf course poser\nJag with the chauffeur\nAlso sent paper to the rebel fighters in Angola\nCause back then the OG's understood the mission of the system for planting division in the hood\nReal real soldiers\nSpirit hustle may be part of living\nIf you did it never spat it in your lyric\nThey was training raising bars martial arts kicking a teddy boys ass taking a scholarly class\nMind sharp\nInspired by the Marleys and Arleys and Panther party's\nSaw the road as a means to an end for real shit they starting\nThe movement got devoured\nYou know the system cowards\nThat Rejected anything that's a threat to the power\nLocked up the militants labeled them schizophrenic\nLiquid cosh their necks so they could never defend it\nThe rest\nNever been soldiers\nLook how they folded\nSoon as the moneys involved with\nCrack hit in '86\nLit a spliff with boulders\nMichael's father was a last of a dying breed\nCoulda Been the leader that we need but we didn't heed\nWith the entrepeneur mind like SB\nOur Potential will blossom if it just left be\nBut Pigs killed him\nNot the first won't be the last\nBut he made the news the day the trials starts\nWhat a farce tryna charge police even with the footage showing them over his dead body laughing they got released\nThat's when Michaels mother lost it\nHe was just a toddler\nSent to live with grandmother too sick to raise him proper\nBy the time granny died mum was an alchoholic\nAnd touched the crack too but never recovered from it\nSo care homes for Michael\nWhere he kept getting neglected\nWhat becomes of the little boy who gets molested\nHow does he admit it\nAnd tell the world about his deathwish\nIt's easier to play hard and just get arrested\nDid I mention a genius with maths and science\nAnd finally he's got a teacher that is really trying\nJane Taylor\nHalf Irish half from Grenada took this little boy & showed him love and saw what he was made of\nBut the years out and primary school is over now he's losing his mother figure again so he's turning colder\nCause secondary is never steady, deadly for many\nFrightened by the height and the fightin ever ready to expell em or dispell em\nWhatevers in their melon\nAnd of course other youts wanna shank em and shell em selling or not\nEvery other day your getting searched\nWhen it first happened to Michael\nYou know his pride was hurt\nBut their were many many\nFelt a violation of his fathers memory\nEvery time he stood their pockets getting emptied\nBut all they found was Algebraic equations that he was blazing\nHe Kept his love for the knowledge dispite his teachers hating\nBut when your school dinners free\nAnd you can see\nSocks bursting out of your shoes\nWhat will it be?\nWhen your elders say pick up this Q make P\nIt ain't rocket science your a smart kid your aiming for a key\nWatch how many doors and more legs it opens\nPromoting the key to ya never tell you about the doors it closes\nBut Michael new the cycle and what it might do\nHe seen enough crashes but he jumped on the bike too\nCause love from the olders made his shoulders feel bigger than boulders\nAnd most of the things that we do we just wanna be noticed\nSo he hustled harder\nLeader like his father\nHe ain't a schoolboy no more he's deep in the drama\nYoungest in the click\nQuickest with a brick\nSickest with the stick\nStuck up grown men\nRep getting big\nDown in Bond Street shopping\nShould of been in Year 11\nLiving like a spoilt rich kid\nBut even more depressing\nWhere the trigger pressing take you quickly where your destined\nAnd quickly you learn that's it's sick and just how quick ya bredrins snake ya\nFor paper and he was no safer\nThan any other thug with a stick might make ya\nTouch 21 and he seen enough paper\nAnd enough death to take ya breath to your maker\nBut\nWas never that mean couldn't be seen\nDealing with pregnant fiends\nHis boy told him the games that dirty\nMaybe you should leave?\nPlus he got a queen and she ain't on the hype\nAin't impressed by the bullshit\nCoulda been the wife\nBut when Mike got shift again sent for another bird\nStacey said that's the end and woulda kept her word\nBut her belly started bulging\nShe took the V.O and told him\nIt's still over I ain't raising my yout on the road ting\nBut Michael insisted and listed reasons why it's different\nHe grew up without a dad and swore that his yout would be different\nStacey looked into his eyes and saw that he meant business\nKissed him and told him she missed but play your positon\nShe got visions of them living when he was out of prison\nHe gave his lines to his boys made it an early Christmas\nThe babys born he named him after his pops\nBut he ain't seen him yet didn't wanna meet him in the box\nSo all they got is pictures\nFeeling complete without the riches\nHaving all a man really needs a baby and a missus\nTwo weeks from his release with the picture in his hand\nAnother inmate ran up on him with the shank\nTried to buss his throat\nQuick reflex\nMicheal raised his arm just about managed to protect his neck\nThey fought and wrestled\nHe looked into his eyes\nAnd to his surprise\nHe finally managed to recognise\nLittle P\nHe used to take his paper away\nHe swore that he was such a dickhead that he did it bareface\nIf you learn nothing learn any dickhead can kill\nAnd everybody bleeds ain't nobody made of steel\nLittle P stuck the shank in\nTore apart micheals flesh\nMichael pissed and shit on himself and took a breath\nHis last\nChoked to death on his own blood\nNever went out like scarface\nKnow one ever does in the real world\nOne bag a mandem doing life\nWasting away wanking and worried about their wife\nWho's bending her over and giving her the pipe\nI don't care who you are 30 years is a bloody long time\nIn the real world\nWe have dreams and feelings\nWhen they get crushed that's when we turn into aggresive demons\nNever been saying I don't get the aggression\nBut let's not pretend that we're rebelling\nBy selling what we are selling and shelling a brothers melon\nAnd kicking each others head in that is what we are defending\nIn the real world we don't run the road\nThey run the road\nThe same people you pay Tax to, shit is cold\nYou think they won't shot food and make law\nThis ain't nothing new look up the Opium wars\nSpiteful spiral inner city cycle\nDeliberately designed to\nThe question is now\nWho's gonna raise Michael", "year": null, "album": null, "image":
