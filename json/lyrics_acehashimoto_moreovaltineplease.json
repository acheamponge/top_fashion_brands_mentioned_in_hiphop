Nigga, fuck rapping\nI'm in cell 1 and 2 because I'm considering trapping\n3 or 4 with some overweight groupies\nAnd a food stamp nigga and a motherfucking hoopdy\nBut truthfully, I'm hungry, these rappers is lunchmeat\nI laugh at AIDS victims, cold heart, fuck heat\nFuck school, do drugs, holes with no magnum, kill everyone in the industry\nAnd drag them to the florist by the end of the chorus, so they can be alive in case\nMy fucking verse is boring, bass in the stairs\nStock shit like a share, I'm a virus\nHaving great dreams of fucking Miley Cyrus\nBitches, I bag them, jeans, I sag them\n7, 8, y'all don't lay them straight, your nigga is fag them\n9, 10, I'm a motherfucking sin\nTurn this shit off before I say... Amen\n\n[Chorus: brandUn DeShay]\nMy respect, a four-figure check every month for the rent\n(That's all that I'm asking for)\nA fake ID to get inside the bar in a mid-size car\n(That's all I'm really asking for)\nA best friend with a little bit of class and a girl who loves jazz\n(That's all that I'm asking for)\nTo be internationally known so everywhere I go, I'm home\n(That's all that I'm asking for)\n\n[Verse 3: brandUn DeShay]\nWhat the heck I look like, trying to impress fishes?\nThere's plenty fish in the sea, and I love fishes\nI don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches\nGive me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes\nIt's no secret, I love breasts, but I hate chickens\nIt's no secret, I love getting, but hate wishing\nHey, listen, I know you heard a lot of rappers\nBut there's a difference, I'm an emcee that's dapper\nA little sex appeal 'cause I think sex is real fresh\nBut honestly, the music is the best\nOnly God comes before it like I before E, except after C\nWell, you know what I mean\nI just want you to see the big picture\nA lot of dudes need help being cool like Kool-Aid, I'm a big pitcher\nTrying to sell to a hypnotized world\nWhat I gotta do, sing the Spice Girls?\nFine\n(Ayo, tell them what you want, what you really, really want)\nAyo, I'll tell them what I want, what I really, really want\nI want art, I want peace, I want sound, I want love\nAnd what I really, really, really want to zigazig ha\n(Ayo, tell them what you want, what you really, really want)\nAyo, I'll tell them what I want, what I really, really want\nI want art, I want peace, I want sound, I want love\nAnd what I really, really, really want to zigazig ha\n\n[Outro: brandUn DeShay & Tyler, The Creator]\nBrandUn DeShay\nTyler, The Creator\n16-Bit meets Odd Future\nYep\nI mean, we really gotta stop meeting like this, Ty\nI got you, my nigga\nIt's not even fair to the world\nCome on, man, we just made a classic\nFrom now until forever\nForever", "year": "2009-02-23", "album": "Volume: Two!
