This is your captain\nHopping out the cockpit\nI forgot my parachute\nBut I got my bay sounds\nSo I'll be going dummy\nRocking on the way down\nI'll be saying, \"Hey ground!\"\nHowzabout we make out?\nI'll put on some Ray Brown\nYou can grab some take out\nLove isn't more sin, love isn't forced in\nGetting under your skin, digging for endorphins\nIt's the portion some of us'll forgo\nFingers on your torso tapping you in Morse code\nThe opera aria we're singing like a bar song\nThe stranger's pretty face that hits you like a car bomb\nThe wrinkled note we passed in class in second grade\nAnd all it says up on the page (is)\n\n[Chorus: Passion]\nI got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love\nBecause, because, because, because\nI got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love\nBecause, because, because, because\n\n[Verse 2: Watsky]\nBecause my Grandma lived to 99-eleven months\nBetween a hundred years of solitude and heaven once\nBecause she loved her son but couldn't ever say it right\nBecause the language of the planet isn't day and night\nIt's in the in between, it's when we intervene\nAnd never let a silly hater rabbit pimp the scene\nFor the deaf kid in the aisle of the symphony\nWho hears it through the rumble of the tuba and the timpani\nFor those lay waste to beauty with a straight face\nEverywhere on earth we're all escaping from the same place\nAnd, yes, occasionally we get drunk and out of line\nLast night, there's a lamp post that I asked to be my valentine\nTake a shady place, shine until it radiates\nSeventeen to eighty eight, make a break and head west\nOr make a promise to your lady in a red dress\nLast night in my hot mess\nThat lamp post said yes\n\n[Chorus: Passion]\nI got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love\nBecause, because, because, because\nI got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love\nBecause, because, because, because\n\n[Verse 3: Watsky]\nDetroit is equal till there's half its people laid off\nWhile corporate lawyers and former employers play golf\nBecause of furor over every juror paid off\nAnd because the F\u00fchrer used to be a boy named Adolf\nBecause of Anakin, instead of panickin'\nAnd because of every man who can be more than just a mannequin\nBecause of Tienanmen, because there was a cameraman\nAnd because of the cameraman chasing princess Diana and\nBecause of Tammany hall, because of Gramercy park\nBecause of Amityville and because of amnesty\nBecause of famine and because its not a fantasy\nBecause of every tenement into family\nTentative to say cause of combs cause of hannity\nHomes for humanity the bones of my ancestry\nGrown and gone on gravestones and drawn on payphones and palms\nRaised up in alms", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3433966a73a598eca7e6120b7f0cbab3.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Guilty Pleasures", "title": "I Got This Love"}]}
