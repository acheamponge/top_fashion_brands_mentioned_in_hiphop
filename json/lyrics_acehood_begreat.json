My homies\nDiffernent kind of strokes\nThe boy Gary Colemen\nMeeting different women\nAnd I swear I gottem open\nNo love for them because the ice box frozen\nBeen to the bottom now its spring like Poland\nWattup 'tho\nRenegades we weriting history\nIma inspired by the beat\nCups for victory\n\n[Hook]\nHey hey hey hey\nAnd I been through that pain\nIn my life earning my stripes\nBut still Im going fight this war\nCause they say that I won't\nShow them I will\nYou with me let me hear you say\nThat we never gone stop aim for the top head to that sky\nI just wantto be great\nBe great be great be great\nI just wanna be great\nBe great be great be great\nI just wanna be\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nHella passionate adamant yes accurate\nScience to the game I study like that anatomy\nUsed to can't battle me now I triple your salay\nBack full of batteries thats definition of statergy\nDay I let them win that'll be death of me\nSomething you will never see\nDope like amphetamine\nRiding in some shit that probably dropping 2017\nMartin Luther ain't the only one who had a dream\nI just wanna be great MJ style\nDoubted by the critics hiphop's stepchild\nLittle boys and girls way your head down\nYou can be great you just got to say it proud\nOn a mission my ambition got me living different\nBig crib but a made man living in it\nWords to my niggas they the living witness\nBelieve that Im great glad you living with us\n\n[HOOK]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6fa5d4ea047dabc03fd8f9eabeac8677.600x600x1.jpg"}]}
