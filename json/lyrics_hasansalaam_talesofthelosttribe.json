Sinai\nMix of clay and iron like master Farad\nSo recognize God\nThe streets got 1,001 tales like those of Shahrazad\nOnly difference is majority end with the most tragic epilogues\nBricks on the block chipping of from the shots of the Kalashnikov\nMost of our life spent chasing a mirage\nFast cars and faster women\nBut this is water in the desert straight from Zamzams well\nThe moral to the stories dead men can't tell\nTo hell we've grown accustomed know it all to well\nSo any glimpse of heaven we rejoice like the birth of Emmanuel\nI got dreams of being free and raising seeds\nAnd I'd die if it means that my brothers would succeed\nI know its hard to see the forest through all of the trees\nSo whenever the angels call I fall to my knees\nListen\n\n[Hook]\nTo the Lost Tribe who questions where Allah is\nOr where Jehovah, Yahweh and Jah is\nThe most highs manifested all around and inside us\nSee its the light that guides us\nWillie Lynch out to conquer and divide us\nAmerikkkas making laws to deprive us\nSo take heed this a word to the wisest\nOut of darkness the Sun of Man rises(x5)", "title": "Tales of the Lost Tribe", "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/0804eb006d98eda612b35e95a5e8bf44.600x600x1.jpg"}]}
