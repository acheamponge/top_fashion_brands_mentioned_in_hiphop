(Can you?) Can you handle it?\nJust thought I'd let you know how I'm feeling (How I'm feeling)\nCan you handle it? (Can you?) Can you handle it? (Handle it)\n\n[Verse 1]\nShe know I'm different, give her a '90s rap kind of feeling\nType of nigga who ain't runnin' 'round with hella children\nStar power, look at 'em starin' when I come in the building\nSunflower, look how you shine bright on them other women\nNever hesitated, dedicated conversation\nAll she ever say, I love to see you make it\nI spin the globe, tell her, \"Pick a place and I'ma take you\"\nShe say, \"I hope you know them other niggas hate you\"\n'Cause they ain't you, we make love 'til your face blue\nButterflies in her stomach soon as I come through\nNew coupe, suckin' on that pussy like a flute\nShe roll my weed and I be smokin' like I'm kin to Snoop\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you know what the deal is? (The deal is?)\nCan you handle it? (Can you?) Can you handle it?\nJust thought I'd let you know how I'm feeling (How I'm feeling)\nCan you handle it? (Can you?) Can you handle it? (Handle it)\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis thing that we got\nBest believe it's real, the number one spot\nSlowly, but haters all gon' plot\nCuz see how we rock, all the time, tick tock\nAlways blowin' up our spot\nWonderin' how we got hella whips, car lot\nSex great, so real\nIn that thing, call me Kill Bill\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you know what the deal is? (The deal is?)\nCan you handle it? (Can you?) Can you handle it?\nJust thought I'd let you know how I'm feeling (How I'm feeling)\nCan you handle it? (Can you?) Can you handle it? (Handle it)"}], "artist": "J. Stalin"}
