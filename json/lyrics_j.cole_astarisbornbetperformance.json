Cole]\nAnd could I be a star?\nDoes fame in this game have to change who you are?\nOr could I be the same one who came from a far away life\nJust to make it in this broadway lights\nNow I'm shinin in the broad, day-light - go figure\nA slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the 'Ville\nGot a deal, a real life saver\nDreams of being behind the wheel like, Jada\nI chill now, cop a lil' ice later\nCole, you got a glow like a lil' Lightsaber\nSo, clap for him, then applaud Hov\nHe gave 'em the platform\nFlow so sick thought he wrote the rap for him - no sir\nThe flow cold as a shoulder of a gold diggin hoes\nWhen a broke nigga 'proaches\nTold ya I'm focused man, I'll let you muh'fuckers soak it in\nClap for him\n\n[Verse 2: J. Cole]\nDear Lord, what am I here for?\nIs it the girls, or the money or is there more?\nI know the world \u2019bout to come to an endin\u2019\nSo, before it does, let me finish all my sinnin\u2019\nI see the devil grinning, as if he winning\nThis just the bottom of the 9th inning\nI\u2019m coming back like light-skin and\nWhat a sad sight, lookin\u2019 at my gas light\nDamn, man, I just threw ten in\nLook, 5 dollars won\u2019t get you what it used to\nAnd, look, love don\u2019t mean what it used to\nAnd everybody and they momma on YouTube\nIs it just me or is this unusual?\nDon\u2019t wanna lose you, just wanna reach y\u2019all\nSo let me slow down to the beat y\u2019all\nPut the remote down, move ya feet y\u2019all\nOne time for the boys holdin\u2019 heat y\u2019all\nKeep that tucked \u2018fore somebody get hurt\nSee me, I\u2019d rather cut let ya body give birth\nNow, if you was the last man walking on Earth\nTurn this up, clap ya hands like this was church\nHey\u2026and clap for him\u2026"}], "artist": "J.
