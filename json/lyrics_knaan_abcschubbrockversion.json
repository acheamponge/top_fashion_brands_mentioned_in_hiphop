Brooklyn to Somalia\nAnd it goes in the background\nPlaya, that is my sound\nThe green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top\nPioneer legend, and they call me Mr. Rock\nNo B word or N word, I don't need those words (no)\nRespect for hers\nThe game dried up, so we come with the grease\nLeadin' ya right and treatin' ya right, so peace\n\n[Chorus]\nSuperman is known by the locals\nAs this dude who's so fly it's global\nAttitude that came outta struggle\nDestitute but I make it hopeful\nYou real, but my real is tenfold\nMy real'll make yours a rental\nGangsta if at ease, essential\nFight with guns or utensils\nSo bold nothin's confidential\nBreakfast was not continental\nAnd lunch could not compliment all\nWe still become competent souls\nThese streets ain't paved with no gold\nMatter fact someone stole the light bulb\nNobody fat enough for lypo\nThey don't teach us to read and write, so\n\n[Chorus]"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
