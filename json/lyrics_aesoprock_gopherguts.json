That's better, here we here we go\nDisenchanted face printed on a zero-dollar bill\nGot a little plot of land where authority isn't recognized\nContraband keeping the core of his Hyde Jekyll-ized\nCheck! Never mind a misanthrope vying for affection to the wretched sound of mysticism dying\nIt is something he must handle on his own; the wind blown way, wanna win? Don't play\n\n[Hook 2]\nToday I pulled three green frogs out of leaf and bark\nWhere the grape vines climb a convenient barn\nI told them, \"You will grow to be something tenacious and exalted;\nYou are mighty, you are gracious, you are lauded\"\nThen I let them go\nOh..\n\n[Verse 3]\nI have been completely unable to maintain\nAny semblance of relationship on any level\nI have been a bastard to the people who have\nActively attempted to deliver me from peril\nI have been acutely undeserving of the ear that listen up\nAnd lip that kissed me on the temple\nI have been accustomed to a stubborn disposition\nThat admits it wish its history disassembled\nI have been a hypocrite in sermonizing tolerance\nWhile skimming for a ministry to pretzel\nI have been unfairly resentful of those I wish\nThat acted different when the bidding was essential\nI have been a terrible communicator\nProne to isolation over sympathy for devils\nI have been my own worst enemy since the very genesis of rebels\n\n[Hook 3]\nToday I pulled three ghost crabs out of rock and sand\nWhere the low tide showcased a promised land\nI told them, \"You will grow to be something dynamic and impressive;\nYou are patient, you are gallant, you are festive\"\nThen I let them go\nOh\n\n(On and on and on and on...)", "title": "Gopher Guts", "album": "Skelethon", "image": "https://images.genius.com/be7ecb35b49d25728281da97d28c2ca1.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2012-07-10"}], "artist": "Aesop Rock"}
