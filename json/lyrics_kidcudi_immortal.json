I sure hope\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm living my life as if I got powers\nAnd tonight I feel immortal\nI said tonight I feel immortal, ohh\nTonight I feel immortal, whoh\n\n[Bridge]\nHm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm\nHm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm\nHm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm\nHm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm\n\n[Verse 2]\nBet you want to see me weak, not sort of my thing you see\nI'm too damn cool, my mojo too dope\nIt's the same old thing getting lost day and night, young and lost in the pain\nSo many times I've broke this vicious cycle\nHmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain\nShocking waves make me feel I can float\nSurely I'ma do what I want, ain't got no one to blame\nI can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm living my life as if I got powers\nAnd tonight I feel immortal\nI said tonight I feel immortal, ohh\nTonight I feel immortal, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nHm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm\nHm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm\nHm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm\nHm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm living my life as if I got powers\nAnd tonight I feel immortal\nI said tonight I feel immortal, ohh\nTonight I feel immortal, yeah-ah\nOhh, I, ohh\n\n[Outro]\nDon't Fuck with me. Fuck with me. Don't, don't fuck with me. Fuck with me"}]}
