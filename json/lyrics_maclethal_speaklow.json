Let it cripple your steps\nThe end is serious in death, infinite jest\n\n[Hook]\n\nSweet love, won\u2019t you please speak low?\nYou got a sweet love, won\u2019t you please speak low?\nYou gotta hush, understand there ain\u2019t no rush\nAnd that my patience is a little too sensitive to touch\n\nSo sweet love, won\u2019t you please speak low?\nYou got a sweet love, won\u2019t you please speak low?\nYou gotta hush, understand there ain\u2019t no rush\nAnd now my patience is a little too sensitive to touch\n\n[Verse 2: Mac Lethal]\n\nSpeak low, you\u2019re weakening the stock\nCause all you do is talk talk talk talk talk like 2Pac\nIn interviews so crass and ravenous\nPassionately soaking me in old-fashioned adages\nReload, my ego is so damn savage\nThat it sometimes convinces me that I\u2019m above average\nBelow madness, right here, right there\nIf I never heard your voice again I probably wouldn\u2019t care\nSo just stare with the jolly crooked stare\nFinding people like me in Hollywood is rare\nSee I don\u2019t act, I don\u2019t retract any statements\nAnd I don\u2019t give a fuck where all the cuteness in my face went\nI got a belly and I\u2019m balding on my skelly\nAnd I\u2019m not in need of food, love, or money so I\u2019m wealthy\nMy well-being works like this, I\u2019m satisfied with my life\nTherefore I\u2019m rich, get it?\n\n[Hook]\n\nSweet love, won\u2019t you please speak low?\nYou got a sweet love, won\u2019t you please speak low?\nYou gotta hush, understand there ain\u2019t no rush\nAnd that my patience is a little too sensitive to touch\n\nSo sweet love, won\u2019t you please speak low?\nYou got a sweet love, won\u2019t you please speak low?\nYou gotta hush, understand there ain\u2019t no rush\nAnd now my patience is a little too sensitive to touch\n\n[Verse 3: Mac Lethal]\n\nEverybody\u2019s fucking out their minds\nEverybody\u2019s acting like we\u2019re running out of time\nLike time is so precious, your patience is tested by this place\nThis place of rotten rancid faith\nThis taste, this cotton candy taste\nComes when I spew waste out over the boom bass\nSo let\u2019s discuss time, I see you get upset when you gotta wait in line\nWhen you\u2019re in a traffic jam getting plagued with personal troubles\nThe whole entire universe is bursting your bubble\nLike this world is yours, so selfishly sure that\nEverybody\u2019s else\u2019s intentions are impure\nThe universe is shaped exactly like the earth\nIf you go straight long enough you\u2019ll end up where you were\nThe only thing that matters is the changing of the shapes\nIf you want to time travel just stand in one place\n\n[Hook]\n\nSweet love, won\u2019t you please speak low?\nYou got a sweet love, won\u2019t you please speak low?\nYou gotta hush, understand there ain\u2019t no rush\nAnd that my patience is a little too sensitive to touch\n\nSo sweet love, won\u2019t you please speak low?\nYou got a sweet love, won\u2019t you please speak low?\nYou gotta hush, understand there ain\u2019t no rush\nAnd now my patience is a little too sensitive to touch", "year": null, "album": "The Love Potion Collection 5", "title": "Speak Low"}], "artist": "Mac Lethal"}
