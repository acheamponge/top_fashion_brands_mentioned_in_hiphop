Sincerely I'm touchy these days\nI can't take nothing, I'm tryna treat my record like the law\nShit, I'm dying to break something\nAnd mostly, I'm up and stressin'\nWhen other folks sleep\nBelieve me, I know struggle, and struggle knows me\nMy life owes me, like an overdose\nI'm slowly, drifting in the arms of trouble\nThen trouble holds me\nAnd nothing else is close to me\nMore than pain unfortunately\nLike a self fulfilling prophecy, I'm suppose to be\n\n(Hook X2)\nStrugglin', and it's trouble in\nIn this circumstance I'm dwelling in\nI find myself in the corner huddling\nWith some angry men and I gotta settle shit again\nBefore they gotta kill again\n\n[Verse 2: K'naan]\nI should be chillin' on beaches\nInstead my bone freezes\nDucking Glocks and I walks\nSort of like Jesus\nThe realest thing for me is\nSince I was a fetus\nThe only break I ever got, was at recess\nSo legitimately, I remain very little relieved\nThen at thug rappers I remain very little intrigued\nCan you blame me?\nLook how we lived in the late eighties\nThrowing rocks at the crazy ladies\nAnd when we'd play these\nCrazy games, the whole crew had crazy names\nWe even had a cripple we use to call em lazy legs\nBut my faith remains, untouched and unchanged\nStill in my block you hear more shots than a gun range\nI'm\n\n(Hook X2)\n\n[Verse 3: K'naan]\nAight aight, more to the truth\nNo writing, just recording in the booth\nForced by the loop and the guitar but I'm the boss of the groove\nI speak truth my deep roots remain in equal danger\nThe pain on my song is crazy but the sequel is stranger\nHey man, I'm from the hardest heartless projects\nDared departed I'm now known as a recording artist\nSpilling what little remains of your memories in the process\nBitter a little, but making your names into a colossus\nBelieve me, I'm thankful my brother's still with me\nAnd ain't much changed Bobby is still troubling Whitney\nAnd Bush is still bombing poor people yo he's deadly\nAnd me I got a little recording gig but evidently I'm\n\n(Hook X2)\n\n(Outro)\nYeah...Yeah...The pain in my song is crazy\nThe pain in my song is crazy\nStrugglin', still strugglin'"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
