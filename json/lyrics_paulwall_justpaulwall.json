But you don't know me mayne\nJust because you shake my hand don't mean that you my homey mayne\nIt's people prayin on my downfall\nAnd I can't understand why, cause I show love to alla y'all\nPeople are grateful for the favors you show 'em\nBut when they need you for another one they still act like you owe 'em\nEverybody be takin credit for somethin they ain't do\nBut you need to quit reachin and stand on your own two\nI always stayed humble, I never once changed\nI never got a ego or a big head cause of fame\nPeople judge me off my music but they never even met me\nBut I'd introduce myself if you'd let me - Paul Wall baby\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Paul Wall]\nI'm Paul Wall, I'm the People's Champ\nBut it ain't easy bein me\nI done put in my fair share of work, {?}, f'real\nPassin out flowers at the club\nDoin freestyles that don't go on mixtapes\nI ain't understand it then but, now I understand it\nIt's a bigger picture than just what you think\nYou gotta think outside the box and try to make it\nIt's chess moves, not checkers baby", "year": "2005-09-13"}]}
