Niggas steady wanna play\nI'ma have to let it spray, show him he ain't BDK\n\n[Hook] (2x)\n\n[Verse 2: Rondonumbanine]\nWhen you see me, better keep your face down\nI got a TEC on my neck that shoot rounds\nHit a stain, do a drill, don't make a sound\nGo out of town, fuck a bitch and smoke a pound\nI'm with D-Rose and we toting on the block\nAnd if a opp ride past, it's gone be shots\nDie Y, die Ls to the opps\nFuck the cops, like Tutu, get popped\nIn the foreign car all sacked up\nFreebands got my pockets racked up\nSaying fuck the Bs'll get you whacked up\nAll these new niggas, they can back up\n\n[Hook] (2x)"}]}
