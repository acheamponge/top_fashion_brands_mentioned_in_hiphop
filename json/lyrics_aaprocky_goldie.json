These other rappers ain't us\nSo tell me what your name is, I'ma tell it to my stainless\nYou aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless\nIt's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with\nMiscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me\nUntil I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G\nLow key, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags\nTell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass\n\n[Chorus]\nI said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough\nExtraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold\nHoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes\nAnd them college girls write a nigga name on they toes\nNiggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw\nChrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw\nParty like a cowboy or a rockstar\nEverybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off\n\n[Verse 2]\nYes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?\nIt feel good wakin' up to money in the bank\nThree model bitches, cocaine on the sink\nAnd I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank\nCause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link\nAnd them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink\nEyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank\nWhat you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink\nYou could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state\nMan on the moon, got a condo out in space\nOpen up your legs, tell me how it taste\nAnd them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, \u201cTell it to my face\u201d\nTell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick\nIn a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits\nI'm the shit, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags\nTell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass\n\n[Chorus]\nI said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough\nExtraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold\nHoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes\nAnd them college girls write a nigga name on they toes\nNiggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw\nChrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw\nParty like a cowboy or a rockstar\nEverybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off\nOh, yeah, oh, right\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah\nOh, yeah, oh, yeah\nOh, yeah\nEverybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off (Right, right)", "year": "2012-04-27"}]}
