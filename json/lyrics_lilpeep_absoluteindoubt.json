Cause I don't know (I don't know, I don't know)\nSometimes I feel that weight, I hold that in my chest\nSometimes I hold it back, other times I'm blessed\nOther times I want more, you put me in debt\nI want you like Zoloft\nWanna be like so inside, wanna be like\nFor me want you to be more into it than this\nFor me I want more than you seem to wanna give\nI see passion in the way you turn your back\nMoney and the ice, I put upon your wrist\nThere's a silhouette inside, a lucid dream\nI project myself on you, then back to me\nThere's a reason that she doesn't call me back\nIt is the way, it is the way it really seems\nThere's a vision of an altar now, me and the one\nSome passin' on and out\n(And out, and out)\n\n[Break: WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL & Lil Peep]\nIt wasn't somethin' that I thought about\nBut, knew that you were absolute in doubt\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Peep]\nIt wasn\u2019t somethin' that I thought about\nBut knew that you were absolute in doubt\nI just really wanna talk to you again\nThat\u2019s how I know that I'ma haunt you in the end\nIt wasn\u2019t somethin' \u2018til you brought it up\nI knew that you were tryna make it out\nWithout a single scar, clawin' at my heart\nI saw you in his car, swear I knew it from the start\nBring me down, it\u2019s not that easy\nLay me down, just please don\u2019t leave me\nI remember you were climbin' on top of me\nWhy you actin' like you fuckin' forgot me?\nI\u2019ve been dreamin' about a place out in Hollywood\nTell my mama that I\u2019m movin' to Hollywood\n\n[Outro: Lil Peep]\nBring me down, it\u2019s not that easy\nLay me down, just please don\u2019t leave me\nBring me down, it\u2019s not that easy\nLay me down, just please don\u2019t leave me\nIt wasn\u2019t somethin' that I thought about\nBut, knew that you were absolute in doubt\nI just really wanna talk to you again\nThat\u2019s how I know that I'ma haunt you in the end"}], "artist": "Lil Peep"}
