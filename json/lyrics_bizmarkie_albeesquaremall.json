Swan]\nAlbee Square Mall\nMy house is the Albee Square Mall\nMy house is the Albee Square Mall\nMy house is the Albee Square Mall\n\n[Verse 2]\nI been to many malls from state to state\nBut I've never been in, say, one this great, I hate\nTo say, about the other shopping centers that's left\nBut the Albee Square Mall is the doo-doo-def\nI be in there everyday, walkin around chillin\nFrom when they opened all the way until when\nIt's about time for the place to close\nI'm just running things like a pair of panty hose\nThey all know me, the Biz Markie\nI get more respect than the average employee\nCould work in every store in the mall\nBecause the place is my house from wall to wall\nIf I could move in, party people, I just might\nSo I could stay forever, and it won't be just like\nA bum that you see sleepin on a park bench\nSo how will it be when you see Biz Markie\nI fade them all, been havin fun\nSee, to me this mall is like number one\nAnd any other shoppers there that try to compare\nThere ain't no way they could hang out with Albee Square\n\n[ T.J. Swan ]\nAlbee Square Mall\nMy house is the Albee Square Mall\nMy house is the Albee Square Mall\nMy house is the Albee Square Mall\n\n[ Verse 3 ]\nI step in the place and shop around for a while\nBuy some jewelry for Treny and Ali, and after that I'll\nGo take a stroll inside of Gibb's Pups\nThen buy some fresh silks, Bally's too\nNext stop Olympic, wanted to buy some sneakers\nThen hit the Game Room to pick me up a Cesar\nStroll around with a fly female\nWhile security's riffin about leanin on the rail\nAfter that I go eat some food at Wendy's\nIn the Albee cafateria, could be shoppin plenty\nFrom store to store just stuffin' face\nAnd I do the pfrr-one-two while sayin my grace\nFinally I step off all alone\nUp to the top level to use the telephone\nNever use a quarter, cause I got a calling card\nSo I can reach out and touch everybody I know\nThat's where I be until the day is done\nJust coolin in the place that's number one\nSo next time you'll be in Brooklyn walkin around\nPlay like \"Price Is Right\" and \"come on down\"\nAnd\n\n[ T.J. Swan ]\nGo shoppin\nGo shoppin\nGo shop - let's all go shoppin (3x)\n\nGo shoppin\nGo shoppin\nGo shoppin - Swan and Biz go shoppin\n\nLa-la-lala\nLa-la-la-la-lala (till end)\n\n[ Biz gives shout-outs ]"}], "artist": "Biz Markie"}
