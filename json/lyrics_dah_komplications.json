{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Intro]\nFuck 12 *distorted*\nAbout like half a pint in, ain't even 10 AM\nRadric Davis would be proud, and be ashamed of you faggot ass niggas\nRIP Screw, Blackout Boyz, uh\n\n[Hook: Da$H]\nMask up on our faces so we never caught the cases\nYoung niggas trapping, rapping, now we living dangerous\nNever gave a shit, so what we wanted, yeah, we take it\nPistol in my lap, I'm just avoiding complications\nThis .30 in this bitch, I get to busting, ain't no aiming\nIt's Mr. Never Lacking, packing every situation\nMy bitch think I\u2019m gon' die from this fucking high that I'm chasing\nFuck 'bout being famous, my niggas popping, I make it\n\n[Verse 1: Da$H]\nI'm sick of niggas lying 'bout everything that they rhyming\nI'm riding through your hood, you ain't never there, you hiding\nIt's like the playing manhunt, these pussy niggas ain't stand-up\nBefore they throw they hands up these faggots'll pull they cam up\nRIP [?], I'm on my Pimp C diet\nShit, I wonder why a nigga ain't died yet\nSix lines, seven ounces, ain't high yet\nNine blunts, ten pills, I ain't flying yet\nB-L-K-O-U-T-B-O-Y-Z\n'Til I'm six F-E-E-T, yeah, you know me\nDolla general, second in command\nGot the bag of rolled greens in the middle of my hand\nYou wasn't down with the fucking clique if you ain't have no bread\nJust understand, but enough with the sentiment\nIntelligent degenerate, you buying it, I'm selling it\nRolling with some predicates, going where the cheddar is\nYou fucking know\n\n[Hook: Da$H]\nMask up on our faces so we never caught the cases\nYoung niggas trapping, rapping, now we living dangerous\nNever gave a shit, so what we wanted, yeah, we take it\nPistol in my lap, I'm just avoiding complications\nThis .30 in this bitch, I get to busting, ain't no aiming\nIt's Mr. Never Lacking, packing every situation\nMy bitch think I\u2019m gon' die from this fucking high that I'm chasing\nFuck 'bout being famous, my niggas popping, I make it\n\n[Verse 2: $ha Hef]\nFuck aiming, I'm shooting at will\nHe dead but I'm shooting him still\nMy pops told me shoot 'til he still\nHe pussy, go in for the kill\nBlack Market be killing for real\nMy young niggas shoot for a thrill\nWhere I'm from we don't pray for a deal\nMiracle, you get bond or appeal\nEvery night I sleep tight with the steel\nMy lil billies go fight for a meal\nI pour fo's in my Sprite 'til it spill\nYou might just lose your life on a drill\nDa$H told me \"get 'em\" I got 'em all\nWasn't gon' leave 'til I shot 'em all\nScope on the pistol, I spot 'em all\nIf it's a stain, then we spot 'em all\nBitch watchu need, know I got it all\nRoxies, got oxies, got Tylenol\nPo'd up an eighth then I nodded off\nHe was running his mouth 'til I shot it off\nChopped up the body, then drop it off\nNose on the shotty, we chop it off\nIf it's a problem then pop it off\n'Fore I have to cock the rocket, knock it off\nI was really getting trap money\nPercocet and that crack money\nYou can come and get a pack from me\nStill clap a nigga if he act funny\nOff every drug, I'ma blackout\nStill ride around with the Mac out\nWater whipping, beat the pack out\nNow it got me bringing all these racks out\n\n[Hook: Da$H]\nMask up on our faces so we never caught the cases\nYoung niggas trapping, rapping, now we living dangerous\nNever gave a shit, so what we wanted, yeah, we take it\nPistol in my lap, I'm just avoiding complications\nThis .30 in this bitch, I get to busting, ain't no aiming\nIt's Mr. Never Lacking, packing every situation\nMy bitch think I\u2019m gon' die from this fucking high that I'm chasing\nFuck 'bout being famous, my niggas popping, I make it\n\n[Verse: Man Z]\nMugga back up on his grind, I think I'm losing my mind\nNiggas be lying, niggas be dropping them dimes\nBaby girl don't waste my time, [?] is fine\nBusiness calls all on my line, all 'bout them B's and I'm fine\nNigga that's righteous, all of my niggas they tight\nThey gon' get money and fight, then hop on the flight\nSquad deep, know the set I claim, always let it reign on my side of town\nGraduated from the streets nigga with some Henny stains on my cap and gown\nXans all in my draws homie, that white man in my pocket\nFuck 12, I don't know shit, bitch KOD, you can't knock it\nLocked in the studio we stay, life of them diamonds everyday\nRun to the money, no relay, bring that shit back like a replay\nShorty let's kick it like East bay, she wanna fuck me what she say\nGimme a minute then we play, M-I, Dama Quince\nI just be tryna get my chicken, niggas cry broke, yeah they all bitching\nOver the stove where the hoes whipping, after they done, clean the whole kitchen\nI'm a real nigga, don't know snitching, all by the bag, all I know riches\nAll on the fill, all my foes pitching, slice up your neck, have your throat missing\n\n[Hook: Da$H]\nMask up on our faces so we never caught the cases\nYoung niggas trapping, rapping, now we living dangerous\nNever gave a shit, so what we wanted, yeah, we take it\nPistol in my lap, I'm just avoiding complications\nThis .30 in this bitch, I get to busting, ain't no aiming\nIt's Mr. Never Lacking, packing every
