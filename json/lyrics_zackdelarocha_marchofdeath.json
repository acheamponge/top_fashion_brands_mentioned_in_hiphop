He don't know a missile from a gavel\nPara terror troopin' flippin' loops of death upon innocent flesh\nBut I'm back in the cipher my foes and friends\nWith a verse and a pen, against a line I won't toe or defend\nInstead I curse at murderous men in suits of professionals who act like animals\nMan child, ruthless and wild\nWho gonna chain this beast back on the leash?\nThis[?] Texas F\u00fchrer, for sure a, compassion-less con usurper\nLethal needle to the poor. The cure for crime is murder?\n\nWell I was born with the voice of a riot, a storm\nLightning the function, the form\nFar from the norm, won't follow like cattle\nI'm more like a catalyst; calm in the mix of battle\nWho let the cowboy on the saddle?
