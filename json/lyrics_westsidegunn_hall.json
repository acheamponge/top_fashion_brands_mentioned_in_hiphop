My name West, what's your digits?\nIn '98 I wore two Cubans up in Clinton, now I'm a legend\nLet me talk fly for a second\nI had you lookin' tall in Guiseppes\n\n[Inaudible]", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/2aa1e41ec2f3db9e91cf8c4b80924670.400x400x1.jpg", "album": "FLYGOD", "title": "Hall"}]}
