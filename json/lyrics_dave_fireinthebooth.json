I put in so much time for what?\nThe fame don't impress me, I'll still get active\nLike Jet Li, I'm tryna stay balanced like ah, music is a myth\nAnd every song I make is getting easier to stray from the message that I bring to the table, you ain't eating if your friends ain't eating with\nDickheads, '09 take me back\nI lost two grand last week and didn't make it back\nAnd teachers wonder why I don't work well\nI'm broke as hell\nThe music made me known as well\nSo I invested in crow and shells\nCause where I'm from, you slip, you're getting poked as well\nSo, bun General Asad, we're a bag of rebels\nThis crow's got a bag of bass and you're a bag of treble\nHow can I listen to a man who ain't playing when you talk about the game from the side like Gary Neville\nI'm involved, I'm on a pitch, I'm a centre mid\nI don't need to send for kids\nI'll turn up where your college or centre is\nAnd send you six\nYou dickhead, I've let so many violations slide G\nGuys don't like me\nAnd now they wanna get a name and waiting with a bitch like try me, try me, try me, try me\nAnd watch what the outcome is\nI'm a mix between Heath Ledger and Malcolm X\nOutspoken but I don't make sense\nCause one day it's put the knives down or put the peace signs up, the next day I'm at your home instead\nAll for my pride and respect\nI bought my man a Tek\nThameside days getting calls at like 9, it's a mess\nI put time in my craft, an hour in my coursework and nine in my bars\nYou don't know about grinding my dog\nI put my life in my art\nMy life on the line for my marge\nReal rap, she put life in my heart, I give nothing less\nIf the truth hurts, I like being lied to\nI can't deal with issues in the ways that I would like to\nIt's funny how I've always got a text to reply to\nThat's why I went and got three lines, that's a Haiku\nParanoia got me stressing, man I'm thinking that they're planning SLR, I've got a cannon\nI ain't taking photos, I'm aiming at your bros and taking shots like Tenerife\nThen I'm out the door like I just got a shot for 10 of each\nPride will be the end of me\nI'll just lose my cool and lose a tool over petty beef\nYou couldn't comprehend it G\nLife has been an F-ery\nColour scheme's grey\nGot me questioning my God and all the times I've said grace\nWretch Miller, I set pace\nI've ducked youths down, I had to run the same day\nAsk Serg, ask Temmy, I'm just venting on a low\nAnd me plus four might just turn up at your show\nMe watching in a venue, man we're leaving with your soul\nI ain't tweeting little hoes\nI need my P's to come and grow\nAll these catties on the roads, in and out, they come and go\nFor a month they wanna know\nSo I send them to my bros\nWho gives a damn about my age, watch my energy and flow\nI give none of it to girls cause the one I have is special, like a lover and a friend to me\nYou send for her, you send for me\nLet a girl try it, man a chick can catch fire like Katniss Everdeen\nNo chicks can catch fire like any one of my ex girls\nMe, I couldn't breath, I needed space, that was ex hell\nHow can I wish my ex well, I've still got ex hate\nBryson Tiller I was tryna see my ex change\nI'm Scott Summers now, nothing but an ex man\nStill tryna test my brain in the A.M, that's an exam\nThen it's on to a next man, still scarred by my ex hoes\nCould show her true colours in a photo, that's an expose\nSo how could you ever bad me? I had my brothers and I never had me\nHow could you ever bad me?\nIf I made 6 bills I gave my right hand 3, and told my brothers no snitching\nStill I, got some good friends I couldn't put in that position\nDoes it mean that we're neek so we're different, cause my G's have ambition\nPast the streets we see past the image\nCause you're the last friend by the grave of the prison hall\nAnd you're the first friend to tell 'em to be a criminal\nThe young G just died you're wondering why\nIt was you who gave him drugs and a knife, it was you\nIt was you and now your pissed because he caught another case\nWhen you practically walked him to the gate\nBe careful who you step with\nYour gang, they were talking to your grave\nThe road I'm walking is a maze, six paths like the sage\nHad me in and out of raves, with a flicker on my waist\nTo give a fuck if it's winter I'll catch him slipping in the rain\nAnd my man thought that I was slipping on the train\nBut he's pissed because I've always got a dipper or a chain\nI ain't a witness to the jakes\nI'm tryna put an image in the frame for the lyrics that I've written on the page\nThe way I'm living isn't fake\nThem man wanna G check me, but can't do it to my face\nCause I've got killers in the cage\nShow, party or a rave I bring gorillas on the stage\nThere ain't a rapper or a singer in my lane, a musician in my league\nYou man wouldn't believe that we've lost half our G's to jealousy and greed\nAnd me I think it was the weed, cause them boy there fell off\nThe same guys that used to come around and eat jollof\nWe're in cunch making no profit, 2 grand off of cash points making no losses\nAnd if they put me in a station then it's no comment, no comment, no comment\nThey can keep me to the sunrise, from littering to gun crime\nThe code that I live by I die by\nMan you give your life for you can get skyed by, served like a drive by\nYah I meant drive thru like how? what? why? who?\nTake you off the map and have your mother thinking why you\nI've done so much wrong just so I can make the right move\nThey're still tryna draw me out, these yout's need to sort it out\nNo one believes the stuff you claimed to have done\nYou're on Snapchat, I'm on Radio 1\nWhat don't you get about this?\nI made my mummy smile\nI took myself to uni man I made my mother proud\nYou was in and out of town doing, cunch for an older, probably didn't see a pound\nYou want beef I give cows, better yet I give herds\nAsk Jussy, ask Serge\nI'm the realest guy around, so bang your doors up and down\nThat's when Whitemoor, Swaleside, Belmarsh, Isis, Acat, Lifeus, Skells and yea\nYou know the rest innit\n\n[Interlude]\nFree my brothers\nGet me\nMan like Santandave\nOi Charlie, let the beat run, let the beat run, we're gonna run into the next one fam\nJeez\nOi, shout out my brothers\nYou, my friend, are an absolute beast cuz\nMan's 17 you know\nShout out to [?] in production man\nOi\nOi, my brothers\nOi\nGet me\nJeez\nCertain rappers calling my phone already saying enough already man, enough already\n\n\n[Verse 2: Dave]\nMy mum, she taught me to be self sufficient\nShe always said to put power in your self\nShe shared her hours and and her wealth, so I could stand here and share this wisdom\nWorked 3 jobs and a little wage, from her youth to her middle age\nAnd that was all so I could study right and live okay\nWhen it was Cookham Wood and Littlehey\nI know my mum she didn't break\nStill 4:30 dinner made\nLets talk about your system then\nLets talk about our place in here\nLets talk about our prisons then\nWhen we're so stuck in london people blind we only see the ends\nOut of 63 million, blacks only make 3 percent\nAnd we have no say, when you think, cause you refuse to vote\nLike Conservative policies ain't been a problem for the yutes on road\nAnd Rapz is doing law\nHe sat down on the floor and watched it, 2 members of a jury, in a court\nPlaying noughts and crosses bored as hell\nThey gave him guilty in that court aswell\nDidn't focus on the case, but he's in jail I guess that all is well\nNo incentive to pay attention for a jury the system didn't pay\nWhen most of them are bored, white, out of touch and middle-aged\nLike \"What on earth's a stabbing? Oh my god I hope the kid's okay\"\n\"Please take him of the streets, for my children and my sister's sake\"\nThey don't need to see the details, cause he's young, black and guilty\n\"He's got a gold tooth and a tracksuit, send him to jail he's gonna kill me\"\nWe feel, misrepresented\nBut you chose to jump on twitter over petitions and referendums, I swear to god I'll never get this\nYou, claim to be active, when I know that you won't make a change\nYou'd rather go to district with some bitches and then make it rain\nI know some real real guys that own yards and never splashed on cars\nLike Atif and Wasif who are still working hard in London when they've got properties in Pakistan\nI swear that they're my inspiration\nWe're the generation that's infiltrating all these different places\nAnd we're the generation who mould and craft how the system changes\nBlack doctors, Arab judges we just need a little patience\nNah we just need a little strength\nThis isn't for the upper class, this is for everyone that lives in debt\nThat mortgages and bills effect\nThat work away and live in sweat\nFor every single prisoner that comes home just to reoffend\nNot for any single dad that left, for every single mum instead\nFor every trapstar that bangs stars and works the ends to earn some bread\nI flirt with death and cuddle life, I work this pen\nLong Lartin I work a pen\nI heard the devil cursed these ends that took my brothers, hurt my friends\nWe lost our freedom and our lives\nAnd if you think I'm telling lies\nRight, it's a 20 minute drive and then we have a city filled with life\nBig business, flashing lights, two completely different sides\nJuxtaposed from guns and knives\nThey buy some clothes we clutch a knife\nFor different reasons, most for pride\nOne fucking [?] in this ride, like humpty dumpty have you fried\nI hope you got money on your mind, but ours and theirs it's different types\nTryna show you man the light (tryna show you man the light)\nListen", "year": "2016-03-05"}], "artist": "Dave"}
