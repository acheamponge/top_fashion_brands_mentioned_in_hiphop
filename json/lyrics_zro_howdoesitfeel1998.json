(1998)", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Z-Ro]\nHow does it feel, when they don't believe anything you say\nAlways, got to show and prove yourself every single day\nMan this ain't living, nothing but drama all through the week\nAnd if they don't respect my words, why they want me to speak\nI'm feeling worse, even though I put my family first\nI shed tears cause I feel as if I'm closer to the dirt\nGhetto on on me, stressed out, my mama buried and dead\nAin't got no partners cause my partners put a price on my head\nHave you ever told a lie to make the drama stop\nWatch the ones you love turn against you no more family problems\nHow does it feel to be the black sheep, how does it feel to\nVictimize yourself one time and evermore after that G\nAnd focus on the dresser bad, liquor approaching fast\nSitting around, waiting on death to come, watching time pass\nMy life, my life, falls under the wicked and shife\nI wonder where I got to sleep tonight, my nigga, how does it feel\n\n[Chorus: Z-Ro]x2\nWhen you can't make the pain stop\nWalking in the rain so your tears can blend in with the rain drops\nWhen your kin people done turned they back\nEvery family that I know is just like that, my nigga how does it feel\n\n[Verse 2: Z-Ro]\nI could of sworn I wasn't the only person on this earth\nBut it seems, that I've been one deep ever since the day of my birth\nI'm sick and tired of being lonely in this crooked land, people think\nI'm tripping cause of my facial expressions but they don't understand\n24 years old and use to frowning daily, trying to figure out\nWho's the friend, and who's the foe, you know it's bout to drive me crazy\nMama, tell Jesus I can't handle the pressure, look at\nThe way they do me down here, my vision is Z-Ro on the stretcher\nCan't I bleed in peace, won't y'all leave me alone\nLike Makavelli I close my eyes and picture home\nBout a Mo City block, a place that ain't no Glocks, and it ain't no sin\nNo longer watching my back for the retaliation\nHow does it feel to wish that you was dead, I can\nAnswer that cause many of nights my pistol's to my head\nBut I'm so scared, my life, my life, 360 degrees\nOf being neglected stressing enemies, my nigga, how does it feel\n\n[Chorus: Z-Ro]x2\n\n[Verse 3: Z-Ro]\nHow does it feel, when these busters try to take your life\nLord knows I don't wanna to pull my 45\nBut see I must survive, nigga don't make me use my tool\nGet some of that bomb green from Tom 'fore I lose my cool\nHow can I make to it to the top I'm like a crab in a bucket\nIt got me hostile, I see my pistol grab it and bust it\nNigga get off me, I don't love not one of y'all\nI'm coming for what you owe me and killing every one of y'all\nCall me ceaser, get em while they sleeping, I'm grim reaping\nBusta never saw me coming left him with his blood seeping\nI'm a soldier, recognize the signs of the times\nIt seems to kill or be killed up in this stony life of mine\nCan you feel it, when it's hard to rub against a real nigga\nHow does it feel, to see my blood spill my nigga\nMy life, my life, feel like I'm running out of time\nTill it's over catch me running with my nine, how does it feel\n\n[Chorus: Z-Ro]x4", "year": "2002-04-16", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bc5a520c65940edba0d4847ab55bb2a3.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
