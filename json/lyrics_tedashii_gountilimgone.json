Days a week\n3... 65... Yeah you know me\nI get it goin', goin' til I'm gone, goin' til I'm gone [x2]\nI get it - 20... 4/7... Days a week\n3... 65... Yeah you know me\nI get it goin... goin til I'm gone, goin til I'm gone [x2]\nI get it...\n\n[Verse 2: Thi'sl]\nWonderfully redeemed, but in the hood I m a vet\nUsed to vibe on them pills, used to puff on the wax\nYou know we get it goin... On your mark, ready, set\nThis is just the beginnin', you ain't seen nothing yet\nAll I know is the callin', [?] is my city\nMan I keep it so Lou for the Kingdom I grizzly\nIf I'm lyin' I'm flyin, I salute to the troops\nWe go hard on the block, not just up in the booth\nI'm on the block with the dough boys\nWho fightin the dope charge\nHopin the word he hear will help him see the LORD\nTill the day my casket's ready and I'm in the dirt\n24... 65... we be puttin' in work!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Tedashii]\nBeat bangin... Yeah I represent Him\nHe was dead, but now He is risen\nSo I will tell the world of His grace and mercy\nLivin' water what you need, yeahh man you lookin' thirsty\nI'm tryin' to help them see, but they blinded by they sin\nLet it go... Yeah it's likely either way I'm goin' in\nEvery day man I'm on it, (like the pavement with homies?)\nDippin grippin the corner, You can say what you wanna\nYeah I'm holdin it down, tryin' to let my light shine\nIf you thinkin that I'm trippin baby won't you come 'round?\nI'm just doin' my thing, out here workin' for change\nYeah whatever they sayin, I be reppin' His name\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
