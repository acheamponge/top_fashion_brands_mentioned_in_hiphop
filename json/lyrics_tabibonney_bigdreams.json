The power of it all\nHopes of millions and I don't play powerball\nTell me, do you even understand that feeling\nI guess not at all\nThis is a special club, without the velvet ropes\nThis is more dope, and the bouncer can't let you up\nThe obsession of it all just might mess you up\nBut not us, we were built for this\nIn God we trust, young, some people even kill for this\n\n[Hook]\nBig dreams, big dreams, big-big-big dreams\n(Dang) Me and my big dreams\nBig dreams, big dreams, big-big-big dreams\n(Same) Me and my big dreams\n\n[Outro]\nSo maybe I can be your fantasy, oh-oh-oh"}], "artist": "Tabi Bonney"}
