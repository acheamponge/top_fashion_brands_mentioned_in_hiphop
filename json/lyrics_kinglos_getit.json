That's a coup, motherfucker\nThese bitches see no roof and go woof to a nigga\nI used to watch Star Wars and act like Darth Vader\nNow these princesses swallow up my light saber\nI used to just play Donkey Kong Country\nNow I go bananas all over the damn country\nCame out of Kansas, they say we a little country\nSo I'mma blow us up till we our own little country\nBeen this way since King Kong was just a baby monkey\nWhen haters was jive turkeys and cool was just funky\n1985, we're watching Voltron and MacGyver\nPut together the pieces to set the city on fire\nNot for no bluffing when they ask me how I did it\nI tell 'em That I push it to the limit\nNigga I gotta\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3 - Los]\nThey like, oh shit the crown ain't safe, Los snapping\nYou took the words right out my mouth like closed caption\nCause no passion matching mine\nAnd there no one will mash it up with the mastermind\nHuh??\nHow you passing me, I'll leave ya\nI don't know no limits like Master P with amnesia\nI used to watch Rambo with the ammo in the shotgun\nThen I watched Randal when he scrambled in the shotgun\nI still play freeze tag with my main crew\nI mean I don't but my watch and my chain do\nI'm talking Rice and Montana\nNow promoters wan' know what's my price in Montana\nI say I'm from the Murder where they cook it on the burner\nAnd they whip it in the pot, before they put it on the corner\nNigga welcome to the spot, wanna know what I'mma learn ya?\nFirst rule: mind ya business if the shit just don't concern ya\n\n[Hook]"}]}
