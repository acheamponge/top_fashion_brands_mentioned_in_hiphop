I have some very sad news for all of you, and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight. Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice between fellow human beings. He died in the cause of that effort.\"\n\n[Verse: Bones]\nSee, I could make the world crazy from the sound of a drop\nYou tryin' to calm me like Bobby when MLK got shot\nSee El feelin' like Slim back when Wayne got hot\nAnd everybody thinkin', \"Damn, will he change or not?\"\nI been the same every day and that's my biggest fuckin' downfall\nSay they fuck with me but can't name a fuckin' album\nSayin' that they bought one, I've yet to fuckin' sell one\nSay they love me but they don't know Elmo\nI don't want a outcome, that's the fuckin' thing\nThey waitin' on labels, labels waitin' on me\nWantin' the change from the beats to the names\nRather nickel-dime every meal than be in the game\nFuck you, fuck rap and fuck hip-hop\nLike I really give a fuck if I'm hot or not\nNo car, no chains, I ain't fuckin' all these bitches\nStill, life so sweet and I don't even fuck with Swishers\n\n[Hook: Bones]\nBackwoods guts on my shoes, never playin' by the rules\nWhy you workin' on school? I'm higher than you ever been\nWelcome to my tomb, welcome to my world\nComin' down clean, I'mma take your girl\nRidin' on blades, bitch, I'm cashed, hundred blunts to the face", "image": "https://images.genius.com/378371404c5b96a4d426cd5a2f612837.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
