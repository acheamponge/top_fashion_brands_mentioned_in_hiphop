Who? Me, funny\nI catch niggas gettin' sore when I do me\nI still wish them niggas more than they do me\nGotta live up to the blessings of my Umi\nBring myself, couple steps closer to my God above\nNever read the \"Art of War\" but it's hard to love\nNever know when you go rollercoaster\nAll your highs got a low, rollercoaster\nBring myself, couple steps closer to my God above\nNever read the \"Art of War\" but I could write the Art of Love\n\n[Chorus: Ari Lennox]\nOh yeah\nTrees that grew between us\nTears that drip between us\nYears have blew between us just throw away\nMight've lost our glory, but I love our story\nYeah I lock the door just to store it away\n\n[Verse 2: Bas]\nThe inner me is tellin' me, \"I gotta pace it\"\nThe winner in me is tellin', \"I got a bottle of Ace\"\nCole gave me at the Garden from the case Hov sent him\nLooked him in the face\nTold 'em I can't pop it til sell it on my own occassion, bold claim\nTold my momma I'd be back and I make it, both came true\nThought I was escapin', just to find myself right back in the Matrix, both pills blue\nI thought I'd be fulfilled\nI came from not a dollar in my momma basement\nI came from baggin' product in my momma basement\nAlmost caught some shells tryna bust a couple sales\nThey went and caught a collar in my momma basement\nI've been tryna keep her proud since, nigga way back\nGot some niggas, keep me grounded, that's some way back\nBut I gotta take flights sometimes\nThese are fightin' times, I'm my only opponent\nSomedays I'm betrayin' my holiest moments\nI don't know who could control 'em\nI don't know who could control 'em\nI ain't living for me, I'm the youngest of five\nAnd if I don't survive, I don't know who could console 'em\nI don't know who could console 'em\n\n[Outro: Bas]\nSince I've let go of you and I\nLately I've been feeling too alive", "image": "https://images.genius.com/af366727e7aed2a0785e6834fed54b03.702x702x1.jpg", "year": "2018-08-24", "title": "Icarus", "album": "Milky Way"}]}
