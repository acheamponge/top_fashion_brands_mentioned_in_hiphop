Someone you love?\nNo\nWell give it time, see if I can't make that happen for you\n\n[Verse 1: Ill Bill]\nFit chrome stick up kids and coke sluts\nMy friends rip ATMs out of walls with tow trucks\nBunch of crazy eddies with machetes\nSprinkle a little snow up top instead of cherries\nThey had a shoot out in the lobby\nA hollow ricocheted off the intercom knob and popped little Tommy\nThe projects gave me a sense of humor\nFuck expensive shooters\nMy goons are Freddy Krugers\nLove my jacuzzi and my limousine\nBut all I need is my Uzi and my triple beam\nFlirting with tenderonies, perverted ceremonies\nPour a little liquor for our dead homies\n\n[Chorus]\nPour a little liquor for our dead homies\nPour a little liquor for our dead homies\n\n[Verse 2: Goretex]\nKill any fella\nAfter prosciutto, oil and mozzarella, mortadella\nDave Mustaine veins, hit \u2019em like Lou Piniella\nBaking soda, undercovers looking like Yani\nThey want coke\nStu gobbled up in the Maserati cutting soap\nTen commandments\nGet them bagged up, elephant grams\n80's fishscale like pelicans, Cubans with twenty plants\nAll she wanna do is dance, Van Halen coke vixen\nMet her on Souther and Pickern, face mask tradition\nWindows tinted like the eye on a pigeon, surgical precision\nStove tops, cook crack and crush victims\nHebrew scholar, from the Omni car for a dollar\nSpit the Kabala, MC Lyte razors taped to my collar\nStay hot 'cause I got the same tailor as Tex Watson\nImpaled Nazarene in the Datsun\nFrom Brooklyn to Yonkers\n\n[Chorus]\nPour a little liquor for our dead homies\nPour a little liquor for our dead homies\nPour a little liquor for our dead homies", "image": "https://images.genius.com/80a603727b85f51760c599f962f6b88c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Cannibal Hulk", "year": "2019-03-29"}]}
