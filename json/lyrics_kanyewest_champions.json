Quavo]\n(Quavo!)\nLifestyle on camera (Camera)\nHundred thousand dollar chandelier (Chandelier)\nThey tried to turn me to an animal (Animal)\nBut white people think I'm radical (Radical)\nSupermodels think I'm handsome (Handsome)\nYou might think I'm too aggressive (Aggressive)\nBut really I think I'm too passive (Hey)\n'Til I pull out the chopper, start blastin' (Bow)\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott]\n1500, all in singles (straight up!)\nThrow it up, watch it fall and drop\n'Round and 'round they go\n'Round and 'round they go\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nPray for me\nI'm about to hit the Ye button\nI don't wanna say nothin' wrong\nBut it'd be wrong if I ain't say nothin'\nImagine if I ain't say somethin'\nWouldn't none these niggas say nothin'\nI done lost and made money\nNow I'm makin' somethin' they can't take from me\nAnd I'm fresh out of debt in this muhfucka!\nAnd they still ain't ready yet for a muhfucka!\nYeezy might have to go and put his Louis on\nI'm 'bout to go Gucci in the Gucci store\n\n[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]\nIt's Gucci!\nFresh out the feds in this mothafucka\nAnd they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka\nGucci Mane and I'm 'bout to put my Yeezys on (Huh?)\nNow that Gucci home, it's over for you Gucci clones\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott]\n1500, all in singles (straight up!)\nThrow it up, watch it fall and drop\n'Round and 'round they go\n'Round and 'round they go\nChampions, we run the city\nNumber one, they fallin' from the top\n'Round and 'round they go\n'Round and 'round they go (straight up)\n\n[Verse 4: Big Sean]\nLook, I say a prayer for my enemies\nThey cannot slow down what's meant for me\nFunny how they come around like I can't see through they secret identities\nLately, it's all about Zen in me\nSubtractin' the negative energy\nFuck with the family, turn your ass to a memory\nMy niggas keep it a century\nI blow the check up, nigga, detonation\nKill 'em one by one, Final Destination\nTop my destination\nI got guardian angels all around a nigga, that's deflectin' Satan\nI'm a mothafuckin' champion\nThis right here the fuckin' anthem\nI can't dap you without hand san'\nI don't know where your dirty ass hands been\nI wake up to like a hundred texts\nChampionship team, but we can't cut the net\nShe all off in my jersey lookin' underdressed\nI'm finna buy this bitch a Honda CRX\nWith...\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott & Desiigner]\n1500, all in singles (straight up!)\nThrow it up, watch it fall and drop\n'Round and 'round they go\n'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go\n'Round and 'round they go\nI'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole\nThan to get down in a hole\n\n[Verse 5: 2 Chainz]\nI took a nap in the pulpit\nI never like how a suit fit\nI got a pocket full of money\nIt got me walkin' all slew-foot\nI'm on my wave like a cruise ship\nIn that hoe mouth like a toothpick\nAnyone get in my way\nNothin' to say, I tote 'em choppas like pool sticks\nI wear pajamas to Ruth's Chris\nCouldn't walk a mile in my new kicks\nI'm comin' from the apartments\nWe never had our damn pool fixed\nWalk in the mall with my new bitch\nTell her to get the whole rack\nMy new bitch gon' pull me a new bitch\nThen pull me a new bitch\nSee that is a snowball effect\nI got gold on my neck\nLookin' like a Super Bowl on my neck\nI got a mansion full of marble floors\nIt look like I could go bowl in this bitch\nVersace logos on bowls in this bitch\nLike I'm a serial killer\nI put the real in gorilla\nI did this shit for my niggas\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott & Desiigner]\n1500, all in singles (straight up!)\nThrow it up, watch it fall and drop\n'Round and 'round they go\n'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go\n'Round and 'round they go\nI'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole\nThan to get down in a hole\nChampions, we run the city\nNumber one, they fallin' from the top\n'Round and 'round they go\n'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go\n'Round and 'round they go\nI'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole\nThan to get down in a hole\n\n[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]\nI'm Yo Gotti!\nReach for my chain is suicide\nThe car I drive fit two inside\nThey mad at Ye 'cause he all in the neighborhood\nBut he let them goons inside\nLet's fuck up the neighborhood\nLet's fuck up the neighborhood\nBuy every house in this bitch\nYou know that the money good\nMy wrist in the kitchen go 'round and 'round\nPlay with the kid, I'ma gun you down\nThe roof on that Wraith in the lost and found\nOfficial trap shit let me slow it down\nWay more shit than a Pamper\nAll we rock is bandanas\nWhips so nasty, no manners\nI just got head in a Phantom\n\n[Verse 7: Gucci Mane]\nShe say she don't want a chump, baby want a champ\nShe say money make her cum, Gucci make her damp (Gucci!)\n1017's the Squad, Gucci Mane's the stamp\nAnd he don't never sleep, he's a fuckin' vamp\nI heard your bitch ride on the bus, you don't give a damn\nMy bitch drive a Lamb', you should call her ma'am\nI love my Auntie Jane, but fuck Uncle Sam\nI'm a walkin' money machine, check my Instagram\nNiggas never test the kid so I don't have to cram\nMy city treat me like a king, I should wear a crown\nAnd I don't really fuck around\nI gave my bitch two mil' 'cause she stuck around\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott & Desiigner]\n1500, all in singles (straight up!)\nThrow it up, watch it fall and drop\n'Round and 'round they go\n'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go\n'Round and 'round they go\nI'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole\nThan to get down in a hole\nChampions, we run the city\nNumber one, they fallin' from the top\n'Round and 'round they go\n'Round and 'round it go\n'Round and 'round they go\nI'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole\nThan to get down in a hole"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
