Before Leaving Earth\nThe Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\n\n[Hook: Killah Priest]\nLife is a test many quest the Universe\nAnd through my research I felt the joy and the hurt\nThe first shall be last and the last shall be first\nThe basic instructions before leaving Earth\nLife is a test many quest the Universe\nAnd through my research I felt the joy and the hurt\nThe first shall be last and the last shall be first\nThe basic instructions before leaving Earth\n\n[Verse 1: Killah Priest]\nKnowledge this wisdom, this goes back when I was 12\nI loved doing right but I was trapped in Hell\nHad mad ideas, sad eyes and tears\nYears of fears but yo my foes couldn't bear\nI searched for the truth since my youth\nAnd went to church since birth but it wasn't worth the loot\nThat I was paying plus the praying\nI didn't like staying 'cause of busy-bodies and dizzy hotties\nThat the preacher had souped up with lies\nHad me cooped up looking at loot, butt and thighs\nDuring the service he swallowed up the poor\nAnd after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor\nBut I ignored and explored my history that was untold\nAnd watched mysteries unfold\nAnd dropped a jewel like Solomon but never followed men\n'Cause if you do your brain is more hollow than\nSpace oblivia or the abyss\nWith no trace of trivia left with the hiss\nDoes it pay to be deaf, dumb and blind?\nFrom a slave we was kept from the mind\nAnd from the caves he crept from behind\nAnd what he gave was the sect of the swine\nWhen the Bible, it condemns the pig\nI don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs\nBut we used to wear a turban but now we're in the urban\nNo more wearing beanies and dress like the genie\nNo hocus pocus 'cause I focus on the facts\nAnd put it on the tracks, embroid it through the wax\nI speak on Jacob, it might take up some time\nAnd too much knowledge, it might break up the rhyme\nI did it anyway just to wake up the mind\nOf those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet\nThose who sit home or sell books by the market\nNeed to chill and get their mind revived\nFor years religion did nothing but divide\nThe Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\n\n[Hook: Killah Priest]\nLife is a test many quest the Universe\nAnd through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt\nThe first shall be last and the last shall be first\nThe Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\nLife is a test many quest the Universe\nAnd through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt\nThe first shall be last and the last shall be first\nThe Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\n\n[Verse 2: Killah Priest]\nI strolled through the books of Job to unfold\nAnd open bibles, instead of hoping on revivals\nCalling on His name and screaming hallelujah\nWhen he hardly knew ya, that's how the Devil fooled ya\nSee look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend\nWhy should you die to go to Heaven?\nThe Earth is already in space, the Bible I embrace\nA difficult task I had to take\nI studied till my eyes was swollen and only arose when\nI found out that we were the chosen\nI deal with the truth and build with the youth\nAnd teach my son as he kneels on the stoop\nSon, life is a pool of sin, corrupted with foolish men\nAnd women with wicked minds who build picket signs\nTo legalize abortion, the evil eye extortion\nI quiz son with my wisdom\nBefore I converted, I was perverted and knowledge was asserted\nThe study of wisdom, I preferred it\nThe understanding, it gave me mental freedom\nI even learnt Caucasian were really the Tribe of Edom\nThe white image of Christ is really Cesare Borgia\nAnd uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander\nThe Sixth of Rome and once the picture was shown\nThat's how the devils tricked my dome\nI prophesized to save a man, but no one gave a damn\nFor my nation, the seed of Abraham\nBlessed with the tongue of Hebrew\nNow we're strung on needles and some are plunging evils\nSo study and be wise in these days of darkness\nPeace to my nephew Marcus\n\nThe Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\n\n[Hook: Killah Priest]\nLife is a test many quest the Universe\nAnd through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt\nThe first shall be last and the last shall be first\nThe Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\nLife is a test many quest the Universe\nAnd through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt\nThe first shall be last and the last shall be first\nThe Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\nLife is a test many quest the Universe\nAnd through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt\nThe first shall be last and the last shall be first\nThe Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth\nLife is a test many quest the Universe\nAnd through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt\nThe first shall be last and the last shall be first\nThe Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth"}]}
