With all the scratch and all the contact\nNow what Yall lack contracts mackin the gats (I got that)?\nSee I'm mobbing with a permanent plan, you say he came up quick (damn)\nWhile you still on the corner standing in quick sand\nYou think you know what time it is, but your hourglass\nLet the hour pass right by you\nWhy fool? You should have taken more than an hourglass in high school\nInstead of snorting dog coughing wit your tweaking ass\nI speak fast, stick a move in and out\nNow I'm the man with all the clout\nNothing but big shit, mobbing in big ass whips\nOwn big ships, floating on big battle ships\nFuck a yacht,I'm trynna own a block like the Jewish\nWatch how daddy ball this year Saafir knew it!\n\nI'mma tell yall one more time..listen!\n\nChorus (3X)\n\n(fades)You can't get me..you can't get my crew", "album": "The Hit List"}], "artist": "Saafir"}
