Let's go\n\nRaise the dead spirits\nHow can we raise the dead when\nThey've been gone so long, Please\nBring them back to life\nIs it possible to do that?\nZombies in the streets\nTheir needs have been ignored\nScreaming can't you hear this?\nRaise the dead spirits\n\nIn the destitute land\nWe cry for revolution but don't execute the plan\nOur people get executed instead\nThe land of the living dead\nPop shots aimed at their head\nLost ones, young sons who got guns, they pull it out\nMake them shout when trouble comes\nNobody knows where he got it from\nBut when it blows he's got us on the run\nThe block is scared, living in fear\nTotal paranoia, he takes steroids and the boy is a destroyer\nBullets fly, inflicting his first victim\nHe said he would kill a second in a millisecond\nRed and blue lights flashing\nCops harassing potential assassins\nMamas cry\nThese kids don't listen well\nOne in the grave and one in the prison cell\n\nI'm speakin on those that we walk with talk with live with\nThose we relate to even just a little bit\nMischievous misfits cops and killers\nEvery man woman and child that has been delivered\nIt's not God but made in his image\nIn the strive for perfection we all lose our pilgrimage\nHumble in slum villages peace war and famine\nKeep the young dumb and build up more smart cannons\nSoft porn and hard landings\nFound dead with this ??\nPicked him up from a stray bullet\nHere a gang bangers standing\nHand in your resignation\nLives cut short from violence stds or disease\nBeef and pork\nWorked for a living and forget to live\nSave every nickel and dime but never give\nDie to live live to die\nEvery life that you led\nLived to see another day", "year": null, "album": "The IV Edition"}], "artist": "Braille"}
