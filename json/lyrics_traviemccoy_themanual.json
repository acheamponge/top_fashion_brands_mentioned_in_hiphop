(Whoa-oh-ohh)\nOh, I'm the dude responsible, hey\nBut who am I? (Whoa-oh-ohh)\nHey, I'm the dude responsible (Hahahah)\nHey!\n\n[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]\nThey say clothes don't make the man\nBut I'mma show you how fresh I am\nSoon as I pay my water bill\nAnd a couple other bills\nThey say they got a cure for my smile\nRather for my lack thereof\nSo they gave me another pill\nBut it was just that water pill (Raiders!)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Travie McCoy]\nYou know we all make mistakes\nBut they just make us insecure\nAnd a little uncomfortable\nMy faith got misplaced\nBetween who I was before\nAnd the dude you think you know\n\n[Chorus: T-Pain]\nHey, hey\nI'm just trying to be who you say you are\nBut who are you?\nI'm just trying to be who you say are the stars\nAnd who is cool\nBut who am I?
