Huh, you better wait for lunch, I'm\nNot the one to be played\nTried to wipe the map but I stayed\nHard, cause you ain't got the bomb to drop the science\nThat is, you're just a menace\nYou must be drugged, higher than Hitler\nDelirious, so why it hitcha\nCause I'm the type to walk on water\nSo remember 'Who's the Boss' and 'Who Gives the Orders'\n\n(Was it good enough for ya?)\n(Was it good enough for ya?)\n(Was it good enough for ya?)\n(Was it good enough for ya?)\n(Was it good enough for ya?)\n(Was it good enough for ya?)\n(Was it good enough for ya?)\n(Was it good enough for ya?)\n(Now get up!)\n(Who's the) (boss)\n(Who's) (who's) (who's the)\n(Who's the) (boss)\n(Who's the) (who's the) (boss)\n(Who's) (who's) (who's the) (boss)\n(Who's) (who's) (who's the) (boss)\n(Who's) (who's) (who's the)\n(Now get up!)\n\nDon't try to rag me, tag me and bag me\nYou ain't glad, so I gladly\nGrant you a wish\nWant it? You got it\nSo go 'head, scram, jet, beat it\nYou ain't got what it takes, but you need it\nTo t-o-p A-n-t, yeah, m-e\nSo break a leg and get hip to what's playin\nA rapper shows he can dig what I'm sayin\nOr once again we can go head up\nAnd you'll be hearing (now get up!)\nCause I ain't got the time of day to joke\nDon't even Lyte up cause I don't smoke\nBut I'm serious as a heart attack\nRun it back\n\n(We interrupt this program to bring you this message)", "year": null}]}
