"[Intro]\nPut the soda on it, see what it do\nYeah, all night, all night\nA hunnid of 'em, just sold it all (Take it, cook it soft)\nDrop all on it pouring all all and all ayy\nWhatever tell nigga to bring me my pink phone, ya heard me?\nA hunnid of 'em, just sold it all\n\n[Chorus]\nBitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love\nCocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all\nSurrounded by the angels, diamonds on when I'm talkin' love\nShe wanna be my lil' baby, but I'm afraid to fall in love\nShe say, \"I only get excited when the pack touch down\"\nPray that we don't don't get indicted in the trap uptown\nBitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love\nCocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all\n\n[Verse 1]\nHold up\nGimme that money, lil' nigga, you knowin' that I'ma do right with it\nPrivate charter, they snortin' that tartar, I got 'em surrounded by white women\nI got 'em looking like Paris Hilton\nEach one of my teeth got a carat in it (Bling)\nAyy, I think my plug racist (Why is that?)\nAll he send is white (Let's go)\nThey going dumb in the slum where I'm from\nGot a drum on a gun like a pair titties\nThey say that I'm makin' a major mistake for deliverin' weight but I barely listen\nI got a play that I'm 'bout to go make for like 200K in a matter of minutes\nI can remember the day when the shit was a shame and I didn't even have a penny\nBrand new apartment and we couldn't afford no new furniture, put us a mattress in it\nWent broke in the mall, I was tryna keep up with a image and still had to stack and get it\nMy daughter turned one on a Sunday, next mornin' on Monday, I had to go back to prison\nMy woman was pregnant with Khaza, I put it in throttle and got a new pack delivered\nMy sister was cryin', she want a new body\nI went and got her some ass delivered\nGrind independently, showin' no sympathy\nDon't let the industry gas a nigga\nWent bought me some diamonds, I did it for Mazi\nBut I never really been flashy with it\nKickin' myself in the ass, I went and tatted the face of a snake on the back of my kidney\n\n[Bridge]\nShit, I give any man a chance ya heard me\nBut once you show me a flaw, that fall back game in full effect\nLook, you can leave your gun in the car, dick\nLuca Brasi, I'ma speak for him\n\n[Chorus]\nBitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love\nCocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all\nSurrounded by the angels, diamonds on when I'm talkin' love\nShe wanna be my lil' baby, but I'm afraid to fall in love\nShe say, \"I only get excited when the pack touch down\"\nPray that we don't don't get indicted in the trap uptown\nBitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love\nCocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all\n\n[Verse 2]\nThese nigga showing me anger, they takin' it out on me\nHit the booth after I hang up with Macei\u00f3 Hazis\nI really fuck with dude, for real\nDisruptive behavior eluded me\nWas truly been given a taste, considered this taste for knowin' what foolish is\nO.C. on the road when the coca was slow\nBut I still was on go, I was movin' pills\nMoney discussion, ain't asking a nigga for nothin'\nYou look like a fool, for real\nThumbin' through hunnids, attemptin' to limit consumption of drinkin', I'm through with this\nCaught me a head in a few attempts\nCoppin' the gat with a coolin' kit\nDepressin' as hell when you step on a scale\nGod damn, I got fat, I done grew some tits\nSupposed to be a Muslim but they started judgin' me, laser removing the crucifix\nI hit Rodeo I'm not on the payroll, I shot to Laredo to do it big\nShout out to players who movin' bricks\nBreakin' the package down, boomin' knicks\nI throw you a four-way, two for six\nStand on the jacket, I'm too legit\nI stand in the kitchen and do the foo'\nWeigh on the digi one, two to six, scrapin' the dish\nShe get her a push on a pipe and say Superman do exist\nMovin' the wrist that's movie shit\nAin't moving like them, that's goofy shit\nCaught me a blessin' 'cause I'm a perfectionist, shawty petite and her booty big\nTell 'em it's wonder this shit turnin' peoples into zombies and I don't approve of this\nI got what you want, I deliver the fungus up under the trunk of the Honda Civic\nMy partner denied me, this bitch tried to bite me, he didn't want me to fuck her with 'em\n(Well, damn)\n\n[Chorus]\nBitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love\nCocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all\nSurrounded by the angels, diamonds on when I'm talkin' love\nShe wanna be my lil' baby, but I'm afraid to fall in love\nShe say, \"I only get excited when the pack touch down\"\nPray that we don't don't get indicted in the trap uptown\nBitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love\nCocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all"}], "artist": "Kevin Gates"}
