Love or fear? Choose one\n\n[K'Naan]\nHuh, well let me ask you something...\nLet me ask everyone actually, studio audience here\nThe love movement\n\nYo what's the proportion of the universe's harmony equal to? (Love!)\nWhat's the voice in us, forcing us to favor truth? (Love!)\nWhat's pain and anguish strain vanish in the face of? (Love!)\nWhat's the missing link?\nWhat language do the silent voices sing? (Love!)\nI wouldn't ask you if I didn't admire you\nSo what's between I and you? (Love!)\nWhat's the ocean breeze? Why do men get on their knees? (Love!)\n*laughing*\nWhat's life without love like fights without coys and rights we strike off?\nWhat's the deal between our eyes off?\nWhat is it I can't hide other than when I cough? (Love!)\nIt's love, the opposite of greed and hateful things\nIt's not symbolized by diamonds, but it does revolve like rings\nAnd time marches into the canvases of uncertainty\nDamaging our predictions and conditions we set\nLike amnesty, I'm hard to hate\nAnd whether I'm gifted with the poetry I spit is a far debate\nI'm living a rhyming state and stealing drops on my soul\nAnd the energy I put forth can sink an army weight\nCause that's love, you see?\nThere's many things we don't know about love\nIt's not soft, it's the hardest thing to attain\nCause there's freedom when you're detained\nLeave it to me and I'll explain\nCause it's dear to me like my mommy and daddy\nAnd sister and wifey and pens and pads\nAnd thoughts of random order\nThat border the same struggle of human truth\nWho's to say what my words are? (Love!)\nThat's what's up!"}], "artist": "K\u2019naan"}
