Why would she do these things?\nPut me through this pain now\n\nIf love is what we have then how could it have been so bad\nThat she don't think it's worth a fight, she won't try\n\nBut she'll be trying elsewhere\nAnd she'll be loving elsewhere\nAnd she'll keep secrets elsewhere\nAnd I'll be somewhere thinking about her\n\nAnd she'll be willing elsewhere\nAnd she will be giving elsewhere\nAnd she'll have feelings elsewhere\nBut hope keeps saying Kells, you can make it\n\nBut in the meantime I can't sleep, I can't think\nThere's so many things in my head\nThings she said, things that she meant\nThings that I started feeling the day that she left\n\nThings that I slept on, things that I should have accepted\nThings I expected and the things I neglected\nI better get up off my\nCatch the first flight out and get her back or else\n\nShe'll be living elsewhere\nAnd she'll be crying elsewhere\nAnd shell be feeling elsewhere\nAnd I'll be somewhere thinking about her\n\nShe'll be smiling elsewhere\nAnd she'll be laughing elsewhere\nGiving all of my sweet love away elsewhere\nThat's the reason why I gotta catch that flight\nI'm out of time", "title": "Elsewhere", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5a944a10bb0940f7591a3793da77ca12.550x550x1.jpg"}]}
