Hooked up with Get Low Records\nPuttin this shit together, my nigga\n\n[Verse 1: JT]\nIt ain't a nigga in the game that could hold me down\nI've been independent forever so they know me now\nAnd I'm the cat they gotta find when they wanna get signed\nYou wanna get your paper right you gotta study my grind\nI'm like Rush in \"Krush Groove,\" a nigga that bust moves\nRight out, and tuck tools, bullets that bust dudes\nAin't no beef in the briefcase, just beef for Pete's sake\nWe round up cats, to beat 'em in a street race\nWe count paper up, to make a nigga change his plans\nThey under weight so they ain't gettin off they gram\nYou mad at my boys, cause we choppin 'em in\nThey make twenty then the Fig want 10\nThat's the rules that the Get Low, play by\nThe block boys stay high, California stock with K-5\nIt's the rules that the Get Low play by\nThem block boys stay high, the California K-5\n\n[Hook: The Game]\nHuh, it's the Blacksox doin a joint together\nThe whole world stoppin to listen, ol' breakers poplockin to this\nAnd white boys headboppin in 6's, niggas boxin in prison\nShit bang hard like a conjugal visit\nAnd the game ain't big enough for niggas so move over\nMatter fact, move out, we takin over\nThem boys is comin, and they aimin straight for the neck\nThe B-L-A, C-K, S-O-X\n\n[Verse 2: Bluechip]\nYo, yo, well it's the B dot L dot, you know the rest\nWanted by the feds, hated by the ATF\nYou can catch me at the DuPont Inn, two dykes swallowin gin\nShorty sucked me out of my Timbs\nMy bad, that's your wife?  Fuck your life\nAnyway, I heard you workin for vice\nYou ain't real man you hide behind ice\nYouse a impostor, snatch him off the roster\nAlways live by the rule, get dough, or die trying\nHardcoded into shinin\nPass the bucket now I'm back on bet it\nIf, beef was erased man my tool gon' finish\nNever been the loudmouth type\nSugar Shane of this rap shit, southpaw when the mac spit\nListen rookie, don't make me mad boy\nOr you gon' be like Big, a dead Bad Boy\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nHuh, niggas think they got the game sewed, yeah right\nI'm air tight, fresh in them Air Nikes\nIf the Navi outside, I might be there\nBlack hoodie, black 9, black wifey airs\nRock guns like Caddy trunks, keep a spare\nYou see the lump under the Iceberg fleece and gear\nAnd when the beef cook, I'ma put the piece to your head\nAnd if you see a white truck that mean yo' sheets is dead\nThen I'm goin goin, back back\nTo the block to dump the bucket and jump in the drop\nNiggas know I'm good with the Glock, they call me Chick Hearns\nCause if the game on knot, I'm callin the shots\nI'll wear a shiny suit for a minute like I'm The LOX\nThen get gangster with a swap meet bag and a Jordan box\nAnd when I die, bury me with the Glock, and a bucket of shells\nIn case niggas want drama in hell\n\n[Hook]"}]}
