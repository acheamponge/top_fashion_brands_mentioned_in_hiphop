Hell, stay froze\nIt's something 'bout that company\nI send for you if you come for me\nCome for me\n\n[Chorus]\nIf it's all right\nI wanna kick it with you all night, all night\nHave a good time\nAin't gotta worry 'cause it's all right, it's all right\nAll night and all night and all night, baby\nDon't be shy, don't be shy, don't be shy, baby\nAll night and all night\nAin't gotta worry 'cause it's all right, it's all right\n\n[Bridge: LunchMoney Lewis]\nI just wanna boogie with you, with you\nDo anything that you wanna do, wanna do\nGirl, I just wanna boogie with you, with you, with you\nAhh, yeah\nI just wanna boogie with you, with you\nDo anything that you wanna do, wanna do\nGirl, I just wanna boogie with you, with you, with you\nWoo\n\n[Chorus]\nIf it's all right\nI wanna kick it with you all night, all night\nHave a good time\nAin't gotta worry 'cause it's all right, it's all right\nAll night and all night and all night, baby\nDon't be shy, don't be shy, don't be shy, baby\nAll night and all night\nAin't gotta worry 'cause it's all right, it's all right", "image": "https://images.genius.com/62ac77014890d9620ef8186d7f2f5893.620x620x1.jpg", "year": "2017-06-16", "title": "All Night", "album": "BOOMIVERSE"}]}
