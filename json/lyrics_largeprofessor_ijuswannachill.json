Hotter than a sauna\nSo I don't think I'm gonna, plus the fact I was born to\nNigga to hit the land with the mic in hand and\nSP and hit it like (huh) Dizzy Gillespe\nAnd this is how I do, not three or two\nBut one nigga from Queens for the hip-hop fiends\nAll over, gas a honey up to let me unclothe her\nAnd this time around check how I get down\nAs I go the extra mile, raised in Carlyle\nBorn up in Harlem, ever since I've been destined for stardom\nSo move over bacon, it's the anti-faking\nBeatmaking nigga that makes the Earth quake and\nLet the man push through, others are left without a clue\nLarge Professor in the house one two\n\nI don't wanna ill, I just wanna chill\nAnd keep my hand around a 100 dollar bill (Repeat 4x)\n\nAbout as deadly as a nine, here to rock mankind\nLike a landmine with the ill shit that I design\nProfessor, keeping sucker chump crews under pressure\nLike this girl I know, but yo, I can't stress her\nCause I'm cool like that, matter fact even cooler\nOpposite of sun ruler, having nothing to do with a woolah and Keena\nYou can catch me joyriding on Kissena\nAs I keep the compotition mind up in between a\nRock and a hard place, and just like a car chase\nI'm action packed with the drama of Scarface\nI'm real, honey'll hit me off with a meal\nAnd I'm out so I can get me a stout, what's it all about?\nTrying to stack off a contract, Jack\nAnd stay black, as long as I can keep that intact\nAin't a damn thing stopping the one that keep ya hopping\nDo you wonder what I'm dropping?\n\nI don't wanna ill, I just wanna chill\nAnd keep my hand around a 100 dollar bill (Repeat 4x)\n\nSo strap up for the return of the brother that earn\nProps, but this time, I got to get more burn, hops\nSo record company man, please give me a push\nSo I can swing to higher levels of life like a kids and wife\nAnd I'll deliver, for a while I didn't give a\nFrustrated for fucking with the snakes that slither\nBut nevertheless, in 3-D's Large Profess\nWith what I would call a bullshit-proof vest\nAnd yes, I make the beats you could feel in your chest\nAnd write the rhymes that reflect a young man blessed\nWith the mind and motivation hitting your station\nComing back to attack off a ghetto vacation\nFor the hip-hop nation\nI don't wanna ill"}], "artist": "Large Professor"}
