Plan to protect it with a piece of mine\nFuck around, blow out a piece of your mind.  It\u2019s hard\nWork, nigga [?].  Musical\nArtwork.  Soon as I reach, I\u2019ll climb.  There\u2019s no\nStopping on four fours.  Like bowlegged, low\nJust watch the move, don\u2019t ask me why I do what I do\nBack the fuck up while these live niggas step through\nBack the fuck up while these live niggas step through\n\n[Hook: AKIR]\nStay alive, nigga, \u2018cause man is not the only to\nSurvive, nigga.  And so we keep this fire\nDeep inside, nigga.  Without it, you will wither up\nAnd die, nigga.  Stay alive, nigga.  To all\nMy live niggas, only few is prepared\nTo die, nigga.  Pick up your people, then go ahead\nAnd ride, nigga.  Get live, nigga\nSurvive, nigga.  Stay alive, nigga\n\n[Verse 2: AKIR]\nStated as simple as I can, I am only one man.  In this\nGrand scheme of things, about as small as an ant, holding\nThe dreams of those who believed but didn\u2019t achieve, addicts\nPimps, and thieves who breathe by these tricks up their sleeves\nNiggas in prison see their living through survival as creed.  Only\nEighteen, serving fiends and had his mom signing deeds\nTo her new house, bank accounts, to the scenes with the cream\nYou know the scene, same routine: judges gave him eighteen.  And you\nCould see the repercussions through the bums on the street.  Head on\nTheir shoulders, falling over, they can\u2019t get on their feet.  It\u2019s hard\nTo balance when the foulness hits ya.  Elders say, \u201cRead the scripture\u201d\nI say, \u201cDo whatever fits ya.\u201d  I\u2019ll pray, I\u2019ll play my part\nIt\u2019s at the end of motion picture.  Type twenty-three to plot\nChanges with the age, kid.  Getting these papers to\nFinance me rocking stages.  I\u2019ll get patient, then change\nSwitch: dental pair, health care, and paychecks\n\n[Hook: AKIR]\nStay alive, nigga, \u2018cause man is not the only to\nSurvive, nigga.  And so we keep this fire\nDeep inside, nigga.  Without it, you will wither up\nAnd die, nigga.  Stay alive, nigga.  To all\nMy live niggas, only few is prepared\nTo die, nigga.  Pick up your people, then go ahead\nAnd ride, nigga.  Get live, nigga\nSurvive, nigga.  Stay alive, nigga\n\n[Verse 3: AKIR]\nYo, yo, some decide to play games, some decide to take aim\nSome decide to dickride, piggyback off somebody\u2019s fame\nSome\u2019ll pray on the weak, some\u2019ll wait for defeat\nSome\u2019ll wait for the chance to knock you off your fucking feet\nChallenge your balance, watch you fall in the street, pick up\nYour keys and run you over with your own SUV.  I\u2019ll keep\nAn eye open, sleep, make sure the sky\u2019s over me \u2018cause when\nYou over the sky, it\u2019s over, you die.  Time\nWill tell my destiny more that equity.  I want my people\nTo love and respect me in the struggle \u2018til I\u2019m stress-free\nThese thoughts are serious and much more than lyrical\nModern-day negro spirituals, contemporary biblical\nThere\u2019s a lot in this world.  You might not be the dopest.  Stay\nFocused, always keep an eye on your peripherals\nNo telling what these niggas\u2019ll do.  Don\u2019t get sidetracked\nMy niggas.  Ayyo, just do you\n\n[Hook: AKIR] (x2)\nStay alive, nigga, \u2018cause man is not the only to\nSurvive, nigga.  And so we keep this fire\nDeep inside, nigga.  Without it, you will wither up\nAnd die, nigga.  Stay alive, nigga.  To all\nMy live niggas, only few is prepared\nTo die, nigga.  Pick up your people, then go ahead\nAnd ride, nigga.  Get live, nigga\nSurvive, nigga.
