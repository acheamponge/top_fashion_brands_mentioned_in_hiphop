I'll show you martial\nI try to show you art, but you just pick it apart\nSo I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts\nA whole other side I wanted to not show you\nSo you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow\nLittle soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jell-O 'cause\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nRight now I'm on the edge so don't push me\nI aim straight for your head so don't push me\nFill your ass up with lead, so don't push me\nI got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy\n\n[Outro: Tony Yayo]\nShady Aftermath, nigga, G-Unit\nRap juggernauts of this shit, we taking over", "year": "2003-02-06"}]}
