No one's safe\nHow we gonna do this? There's loads of ways\nBut there ain't any that ain't involving pain\nDon't stop till the problem solved or changed\nDo you do it for the fame or the culture's sake?\nWhat's your bloodtype?\nDo you do it for the fame or the culture's sake?\n\n[Hook: Wiley]\nThis is my bloodtype, bloodtype\nKnow people who are angry, people who are calm but that's what my blood's like\nThis is my bloodtype, bloodtype\nKnow people who are angry, people who are calm but that's what my blood's like\nThis is my bloodtype, this is my bloodtype\nThis is my bloodtype, yeah, this is my bloodtype\nThis is my bloodtype, this is my bloodtype\nKnow people who are angry, people who are calm but that's what my blood's like", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cd54c7751f119aa53e2eb8065e120645.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Snakes & Ladders", "title": "Bloodtype"}]}
