(?) I came to break 'em\nThe Eagles my amigos, yea, I came to take 'em\nAnd-1 like Paul Pierce, I came to shake 'em\nI live to sign another day\nI get greater later\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 2:]\nMy shine, my grind, no time to lose\nI got 100 niggas with me and they ride in 2's\nIf you wanna hate on the Krizzle, I'm slidin' through\n22, we got that window she'll be slidin' through\nDon't get it twisted girl, won't hesitate to do you\nI'm a king in my town, motherfuck I choose to (?)\nBe a boss\nIn my city not acknowledging losers\nGot a clique of gorilla niggas, leave you floatin' up sewers\nIf you lame, young man, don't come to my set\nOut here, it's clear, I done gained respect\nOut here, can't nothing jeopardize my rep\nI'm 10 million nigga, homie go on and cut that check\nRecord execs, lookin' for that pop-tart image\nBut that Bow-Wow Chingy shit just ain't in me\nI'm a new brand of hustler, track star in me\nOn the block runnin' streets, I'mma get that Emmy\nAnd you, you you niggas better grab them Oscars\nCause actin' what you good at, thug impostors\nAd-Libbin' all your life cuh, but my shit's real\nSay you go harder than me? Bitch you're not quite there\nI'mma show you the real on real and it's real\nThat niggas ain't playin' no more with that steel\nThe best advice for hothead niggas is just chill\nBut that shit you sprayin' over a track gettin' you killed\n\n[Hook:]"}], "artist": "Big K.R.I.T."}
