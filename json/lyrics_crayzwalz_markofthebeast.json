Leo in the Pride Lands, repping\n\u201cGuns and Butter,\u201d \u201cBalance\u201d the weapon.  Check it.  I\u2019ma\n\u201cProtect My Family\u201d\nLiving on the corner.

We\u2019re still clapping\nLast seen leaving the building with an Elvis sport jacket\nRapping and laughing at thought splashes.  Bubble your\nBrackets.  I\u2019ll \u201c3 Card Molly\u201d you maggots\n\u201cBody You\u201d bastards, walk a mile in my shoes, burn while\nMy feet hurt, but my soul\u2019s in tune\nRavipops is a learning sensation.  They say, \u201cDon\u2019t do\nAnything great if you can\u2019t handle congratulations\u201d\n\"Revelations\" made Moses disgruntled.  I'm humbled\nYour mother should have breast-pumped you three fucks, dude\nWhen insecure, secure what is envy or suffer\nThe hell of a shell that\u2019s empty.  Came\nPrecise.  Etch A Sketch, your beats is sick.  We the\nMen from Risk with the Solar Panelist\nBuddha Belly on beatbox, John on bass, Rayz on\nSpit, then G\u2019s automatic, usually stick\nLunch at Red Lobsters, Michelle got spliffs\nTell her agency, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d  Kentucky\u2019s the shit\nMark of the Beast"}]}
