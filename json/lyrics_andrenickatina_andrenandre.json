Debit\u2014that's right I said it\n\n[Verse 4: Andre Nickatina]\nI grip my dollar bills like my Caddy steering wheel\nI'm not a chill pill freak, do what you will\nHeart ticking like a time bomb eating spicy prawns\nMan, it's the god of Khan, check it baby, right or wrong\nMan, look but don't stare, it's the crime rhyme king\nWith braids like a juvenile Khan, nahmean?\nWent Bruce Springsteen in my Anchor Blue jeans\nOh yeah, I'm in ya city, man, what's up with the weed?\nMan, call all the Gs, and tell 'em all freeze\nAndre Nickatina sayin' 'nigga, what you need?'\nHit the corner so narrow in a fly blue Camaro\nA sparrow dodge a arrow but not a double barrel\n\n[Verse 5: Mac Dre]\nWe in a 7 Series Beamer, it's me and Nickatina\nReady to sexual harass a bitch like Martin did Gina\nCommittin' felonies and hella misdemeanors\nA dog in the yard where the grass is hella greener\nRap singer, a pimp done slapped Tina\nI mack Nina from Black to Latina\nClean as Noxzema, quick to pop the nina\nGot the money from the broad as soon as I seen her\nWilhelmina, Tina and Trina, got dick by the bay on the Berkeley Marina\nDon't mean to point the finger but uh\nShe got pancake, syrup and butter\n\n[Verse 6: Andre Nickatina]\nMan, the way I smoke weed it's like death of a genius\nReappear, roll up, rise like the phoenix\nThis is not a remix, Nino, Felix\nPut it in a capsule, seal it, deal it\nHow you want it, Nicky baby? Four times five\nA quarter ounce of weed and some cherry pie thighs\nExcuse me if I'm greedy 'cause I'm caught up in the lust\nI'd lie if you want but I'm a tiger you can trust\n'Cause I'm on Fillmore in a white velour suit\nIn a blue Kangol, in my Wu-Tang boots\nWith a back like a cobra, cursed by the mail\nMy manicured nails touch a triple-beam scale\nBaby is a athlete, body like a star\nYa talking real bad, freak, meet me by the car"}]}
