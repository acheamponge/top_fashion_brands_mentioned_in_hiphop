I\u2019m tryna get a bag a week\nPut it in my savings and invest in the right companies\nMy dream is like a child and I\u2019m taking all the custody\nObstacles be slowing me, but that buffer molded me\nSo I take my time, 'cause I\u2019m always where I\u2019m suppose to be\nKeep my niggas close to me 'cause I\u2019m knowing they go for me\nYou can not get a hold of me? I\u2019m probably in a solo meet\nAlways making moves, man that\u2019s how I keep my sanity\nYeah, it\u2019s my team's summer\nCouple setbacks, bounce back and recover\nThe clique real small but we making big moves\nAnd we headed to the top so we can get a better view like\nI'ma catch a tan overseas while I\u2019m out the country\nLet me get some Hennessy while I\u2019m chilling on the beach\nI'ma count a couple G\u2019s, let the server bring receipts\nDouble checking my expenses, never messy, always neat\nNever ever, thats how a hot girl do it\nNumber one stunner, icy girl with a Cuban\nCash money, mama that be dining in Bahamas\nEating Fettucini pasta with the scallops and the lobsters\nHuh, I don\u2019t got no time for these hoes\nSpeaking on my name like I\u2019m someone that they know\nI\u2019m the big cat bitch, yes these niggas love me\nIs that Gucci on my feet? Shit, bitch it might be", "album": "High Maintenance"}], "artist": "Saweetie"}
