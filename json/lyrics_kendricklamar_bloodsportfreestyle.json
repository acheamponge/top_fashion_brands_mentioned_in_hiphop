Aw fuck it let's talk more sports\nHow bout football?\nI run the game like Walter Payton back 1984\nI'm pass you niggas like Peyton Manning\nPlay the field like Ray Buchanan\nWhen I kick it like Morton Anderson it gets scary\nWeight on my shoulder, refrigerator Perry\nHip-hop cops on me I dodge them like Barry\nSanders... John Madden hold your commentary\nKeep the cameras on I'm primetime like the '95 Deion\nShould I keep going?\nAw fuck it let me keep going\nI'mma do it like the '97 T Owens\nNot the \u201807 T Owens\nT Owens with Jeff Garcia throwing the pigskin\nY'all need to work on y'all defense, I train like Warren Sapp on the weekend\nManeuver like Warrick Dunn\nI'm just having a little fun have some with me\nLet's go baseball now the '94 Ken Griffey\nOne man roster matter fact I'm the '96 Mike Piazza\nMVP of LA, call the doctor\nI came up with my assumptions I must be rap ESPN or something\nIt\u2019s about time for halftime reporting\nI\u2019m a star kicking niggas off the field and court man\nI know you good with the right but you still ain\u2019t nice till you do it with the left hand\nYou ain\u2019t nice till you play all positions\nOr knock it out the stadium, hey wait a min\nI got tickets to the all star game, to pro bowl game baby girl bring a friend\nI\u2019m a get you in, I\u2019m a take you out, I\u2019m a stick it in\nYou might say\u2026 ouch\nJust let me score one time\nDribble my balls to the floor one time\nI\u2019d be going for a week bet they gon\u2019 miss me more than a pitch from Nolan Ryan\nI am the Jeff Gordon of recording\nI am Tony Hawk if I was skateboarding\nI am Michael Irv before the coke snortin'\nAw fuck it I\u2019m what\u2019s ever important\nAfter this you gon applaud him\nIf not, fuck it I\u2019m blood sportin'\nHomie I\u2019m blood sport\u2026\n\n[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]\nYa\u2019ll niggas ran out of time to get ya\u2019ll shit together man\nI\u2019m here\nHey, hey, hey, hey Moose what I gotta do boy"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
