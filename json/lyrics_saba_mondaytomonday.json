Monday to Monday\n\n[Chorus]\nI'ma put mom in a castle\nGot it out the ground like gravel\nComing back around like a lasso\nMicro, macro\nI'ma put mom in a castle\nGot it out the ground like gravel\nComing back around like a lasso\nMacro, macro\n\n[Verse 2]\nLike a vision board I see with clarity\nI hustle like my name was Gary V\nFor more than the wealth and prosperity\nAccountants was talking bout equity\nI'm Triple H giving a pedigree\nThat mean that I'm special my specialty\nI put in the work till I'm dirt in the earth\nOr moving furniture to Beverly\nI cannot stress it I just let it be\nI want it all I am not settling\nI'm on the move like I was settling\nFailed a few but I ain't sweating it\nThey say success is like the best revenge\nI can't kick it with no pessimist\nKnow it's my time that ain't tentative\nMonday - Monday talking 10 to 10\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI hustle from Monday to Monday\nKnew that I would get it some day\nGot me feeling like Lebron James\nWasting time bet that's what some say\nRemember when they didn't want me\nI knew I was on to something\n10 to 10 what my alarm say\nA.K.A. Monday to Monday\n\n[Chorus]\nI'ma put mom in a castle\nGot it out the ground like gravel\nComing back around like a lasso\nMicro, macro\nI'ma put mom in a castle\nGot it out the ground like gravel\nComing back around like a lasso\nMacro, macro", "album": null}], "artist": "Saba"}
