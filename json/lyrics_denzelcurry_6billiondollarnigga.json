Wanna conversate like I'm supposed to?\nThrowing postal inside of a hostel\nAnd a poster instead of a borstal\nSoo inpivotal that can be hostel\nI place all you niggas in brothels\nYour motives are inanimate\nCan't imagine when niggas start scattering\nLike some motions and papers I'm rolled up in\nCan't imagine this, not a magic trick\nI am ultimate, you are inadequate\nSo get mad at quick, I am not a friend\nI am not afraid, I will not pretend\nFuck a fight bitch I'll show you what knowledge is\nAll forgiven, accept the apologies boy\nThe loses, Curry be bossin'\nCut your loses with a Katana\nWannabe, cause you want the lasagna\nNigga  I'm nice but I gotta Armada\nMark telling me to tell it how it is\nIf I tell ya'll I'm the shit, now I'm tell ya'll I'ma walking porta potty\nWit a mutha'fuckin' fat bitch in it\nEatin' on a 10 Pc chicken, nigga\nDrive on the other side of the southside\nDrive on the I-95 high\nGet what you ask for, in the DMV sittin' tryn get the licences\nAnd I got a mutha'fuckin' passport\nWith the ball meet me halfcourt\nMy nigga I don't got fans with your fan to raise a task force\nFeelin' like an asshole cuttin' bitches with a sword\nWhen I'm out the couch\n6 Million Dollar Man with a couple grand Curry runnin shit\nWhat the fuck is a track suit?\nI know that shit attracts you\nI know that shit attracts you\nI know that shit attracts you\nThat's all I got"}], "artist": "Denzel Curry"}
