Back for the platinum and gold\nThe green backpack's back for a go\nI tried to relax and put the green backpack on hold\nBut now it's 'bout to get packaged and sold\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm back, bitch, the man is comin'\nWith plans to rush yah, comin' from the land of nothin'\nHand is rushin', writin' lyrics, can't save paper\nBreakin' down trees as my momma wait for acres\nTold her I'mma take her off the block like Jenga\nFor times I might have hanged in the night with night strangers\nBefore me and my bro was the black and white ranger\nOn Halloween night, frightened whites and nice neighbors\nHoods that we played in and girls that we played on\nHad us lookin' suspicious to niggas like we're Trayvon\nJust another obstacle in a Wichita carnival\nMakin' it out the belly of the devil's abdominal\nSquare nigga so I ain't even round\nI'm with yo bitch, she hit me when I came into town\nI'm on yo shit, but luckily I came in her mouth\nI'm respectful to an extent, X went in, was out\nNow when you layin' her down, you feel a crook in it\nYou goin' down with your mouth, and now it look different\nI was all in your house, she even cooked in it\nShe made that salmon and shrimp, that shit good, isn't it?\nJust ride with it when you get to drive it\nSome don't get to try it, watch it as they sit behind it\nI bet those LA nights had fuckin' been a riot\nBut I'm just mindin' my business and stayin business minded\nGuess who's bizack"}], "artist": "XV"}
