No lie, testify\nLeft hand on the Bible, right hand to the sky\nMy days be long, nights seem long\nCalling on help and nobody is home\nAll by myself, and I feel so alone\nCold world, yeah, and I know it's for show\nWorst day of my life, and it's just getting badder\nAsking Him why and looking for answers\n\n[Chorus: Britt Nicole]\nDark days and darker nights\nHeart break drains from this heart of mine\nDon't understand it\nCan't understand it\nDark days and darker nights\nHeart break drains from this heart of mine\nDon't understand it\nCan't understand it\n\n[Verse 2: Tedashii]\nBombay and that Aliz\u00e9\nPurple Sprite with that Grand Marnier\nSip, slurp, sizzurp, hurl\nDo it again the same next day\nHey, marijuana, ganja\nBlown crop dust like I was a farmer\nMary Jane that dame I called her\nInvested my home and living with roaches\nWomanizing, traumatizing\nThe reason that made me despise me\nMy Savior's bringing them gifts\nPresented as wise men trying to entice them\nLiars all wired up\nBy the men before but I was the first\nBut this is no race or wretch\nA mess and I'm trying to find help\nLooking at pictures it making me sadder\nFeeling so helpless it making me madder\nWorst day of my life, and it's just getting badder\nAsking Him why and looking for answers\nWondering if He ever gon come back\nIf He is then man can you pick up the slack\nCause this place that I'm in I may never come back\nFeeling so lost and don't know where I'm at\n\n[Chorus: Britt Nicole]\nDark days and darker nights\nHeart break drains from this heart of mine\nDon't understand it\nCan't understand it\nDark days and darker nights\nHeart break drains from this heart of mine\nDon't understand it\nCan't understand it\n\n[Verse 3: Tedashii]\nUh, I pick up on a sign quick\nI don't know what I could find if\nSomeone could get me out the mess I'm in\nBrain loss, gone and all it's sin\nI know I'm hurting from my past pain\nAnd people tell me I goin insane\nI think they lying so I keep pressing\nThe way things I used to do, trying to impress em'\nThis pain, I gotta let it go\n\n[Chorus: Britt Nicole]\nDark days and darker nights\nHeart break drains from this heart of mine\nDon't understand it\nCan't understand it\nDark days and darker nights\nHeart break drains from this heart of mine\nDon't understand it\nCan't understand it"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
