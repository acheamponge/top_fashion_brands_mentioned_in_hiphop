No\nThey told me that the top\u2019s kinda lonely\nSo I stopped climbing for, thought y\u2019all might wanna hold me \u2014 hey\nTurns out I already got a category, with a slot all to my lonely\nGod been guardin\u2019 this spot just for me, babe\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen the motherfuckin\u2019 beat comin\u2019 back again\nI can breathe real deep, get a second wind\nDon\u2019t hate what a veteran already did\nBut I\u2019m just tryin\u2019 to peep what the lesson is\nAnd the message is you will never get\nMore or less than the sweat and tears you invest in it\n\u2018less you sit and rest a bit, the more blessed you get\nAnd the best deception is that success is effortless\nTrust me though it never is, let me give that more emphasis\nGet up off your ass, go do some work\nAin't no reward without movement first\nIf you not really tryin\u2019 to prove your worth\nQuit suckin\u2019 life out the universe\n\n[Verse 3]\nMotherfuckers want something for free\nIt's never gonna be, not from me\nThis here lane is my property\nAnd it\u2019s all Ali, monopoly\nAnd obviously I believe in charity and modesty\nBut everything my half blind eyes can see by decree belongs to me!\nI don\u2019t even rap like that, I\u2019m sorry y'all heard me snap like that\nLet me just (*breath*) take a deep breath and get myself right back on track\nI love you guys, I just want y'all to see the truth about it\nIf you don\u2019t love yourself ain't nothing I can do about it!\nThis game polluted, crowded, human garbage oozing out it\nBunch of dudes in a stupid outfit\nTrying to call their group a movement \u2014 stop it\nOld school dudes who ain't poppin'\nHate to see your venue get crowded\nAin't my fault that you ain't inspired\nNo, you wanna see who can boo the loudest\nBut then there\u2019s so much amazingness that I can't resist it\nIt's not that ain't nobody making it, but they ain't listening\nAt age 6 I grabbed a brush and started painting pictures\nGrabbed the mic and looked at God and said \u201cokay, hit it!\u201d", "year": null, "album": "Left In The Deck"}], "artist": "Brother Ali"}
