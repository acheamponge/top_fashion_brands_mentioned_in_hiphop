{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Jabberwocky]\nExcuse me, does anyone have the time?\nNo!\n\n[Verse 1]\nIf you knew what makes me tick\nIt'll probably make you sick\nLay my days of my life in front of you\nAnd I'll let you take your (pick)\nCome on\nPull back the curtain but make sure that you are certain\nThat it will be worth the energy that you end up exerting\nNow walk past the doorway, step into the foyer\nDon't you bother knocking\nI'm a grandfather clockin' everything you do\nI'm seeing through you faultiness\nSo sprinkle me but not with saltiness\nThe ghetto taught me this\nI fought for this, I fight for this, I spend my life for this\nAnd if you put your brain to work it ain't hard to decipher this\nCounting down the days boy closer to your doom\nTime keeper for the Reaper, the family heirloom\nLike staring at my grandfather clock inside my room\nIt'll never miss a tick-tock, it strikes everyday at noon\nEvery hour on the hour, it'll sing a tune\nEvery half hour it'll croon and yell out at the moon\nYou can't escape the master time, no one is immune\nThe hands of time will grab you when the moments opportune..\nNo one is immune..\nWhen the moment's opportune\nCarved from a tree trunk bark\nWhat a wonderful work of art\nWell I usually wear my sundial\nBut it don't work when it's dark\n(don't work when it's dark)\nNo electric parts spark as mechanical as he is\nHe'll kindly say just wind me and then show me where the key is\nThen I go about my day and I flow about the way\nHe never has nothing to say, he just sits there on display\nI seen one in the cafe, one inside the cabaret\nTimekeeper for the Reaper, what a pretty price to pay\n\n[Hook]\nSo don't you bother knockin' at, I'm a Grandfather clockin'\nEverything you do, I'm seeing through your masquerade\nAt midnight you will hear the serenade and don't you be afraid\nIt's like clock work orange lemonade with the bottomless glass\nWhen it's time for that ass!!\nTick-tock\nMy Grandfather clock goes\nTick-Tock\nMy Grandfather clock goes\nTick-Tock\nMy Grandfather clock\nThe pendulum is swinging and it just don't ever stop\nTick-tock\nMy Grandfather clock goes\nTick-tock\nMy Grandfather clock goes\nTick-Tock\nMy Grandfather clock\n\n[Verse 2]\nI used to have this coo-coo clock\nThat would bother my Grandfather clock\nNever gave it no rest so I flew over the top of the nest\nAnd then at my request I ask him to resign\nHe was never on time, one hour behind\nAt ten, he struck at nine\nBut he did not fuck with mine cause I murdered that machine\nIf you ever beat the clock you know exactly what I mean\n(exactly what I mean)\nI hold my Grandfather clock in high esteem\nMy alarm clock screams cause he knows how long it takes me\nBut my Grandfather clock leans over and he shakes me\nAnd they both race against time to see who will be\nThe first to wake me\nBut when I became awoke my alarm clock was broke\nAnd my Grandfather clock was staring right down my throat\nAnd he leaned a little bit closer and he told and I quote:\n\"If you ever race against me, you will surely come up short,\"\nHe said, \"I'm better than your Timex, your Rolex or your Swatch\nYour Fossil, Casio, Quartz, your diamond studded watch,\"\nHe said, \"I control how long you stay alive\nI'mma tap you on you shoulder at eleven fifty-five\"\nWhen the time arrives and then and only then\nYou'll have your five minutes of funk\nSaid my final salutations as I stepped amongst the monks\nThen he took me exactly where I stood like he should\nAnd I tried to reason with him and I tried knocking on wood\nBut he said\n\n[Hook]", "title": "The Grandfather Clock", "album": "A Book Of Human Language", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c348dfe824da4f3b04231c7e4d629ae.700x700x1.jpg", "year": "1998-04-14"}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
