What\u2019s all this doomsday stuff?\n\n[Verse 2: Ill Bill]\nBorn in the Sudan, raised in America\nAged seven in a new land, raised by the Seraphim\nLearned Islam and Mitzrayim, amongst the pyramids dragged by em\nFrom the Nile River later reminisced and drank wine\nReturn to childhood and crime\nDid an upstate bid for three years, out on parole, now the world is mine\nCreated his own movement in \u201869\nNubian Hebrew Mission had arrived, he\u2019s alive\nChanged his name to Isa Abdullah\nMany times after that legally changed his name several times\nLevel nine, Jackie and The Starlights, made music with passion\nRolls-Royce elegant fashion ready for action\nDescendant of aliens from another planet\nThey said Christ was underhanded\nLike King Solomon with many wives\nUnder marriage many seeds many heirs to the throne\nReady to die and forever it\u2019s told\nSimilar to this eleven year old\nAfter being gang-raped at eight memorized the testament scrolls\nFront to back he recited the Bible, word for holy word\nPassion of the Christ on arrival\nThe Branch Davidians took him in then he took em over\nClaiming the name of David from the book of Jehova\nYou\u2019d have thought that he\u2019s from Brooklyn how he had it all sewn up\nTill the ATF had him blown up out in Waco\n[Outro: David Koresh]\nSo you know you guys, do it your way, I do it my way.
