All Throat\nPussy wide enough to catch a small boat\nNah I like the witty big tittie type\nNot hip to city life\nChecking accounts mad weed next to the couch\nButt naked ADT protect the house\nKinda righteous satellite dish\nJew-els be priceless all I gotta do is pipe it\n\n(chorus) Nature: I know what you want from me\n(lady singing) I got love for you baby mad love for you baby\n(nat)you say you wanna fuck wit me\n(lady) let me smother you baby see the thug in you baby\n(nat) if the time is right\n(both) I need you inside my life\n(nat) if you know what I 'm looking for then take it off..\n\nVerse 2:\n\nI hate a bitch with a weak mind and slick mouth\nIn the crib all the time spittin kids out\nSee me on the humble knowing that I be with Jungle\nIt's funny once you got doe somehoes seem to hunt you\nNo remorse no regrets they phone your rest\nBreaking up your home known as pests\nWalking thin lines make you dial star 69\nIt's how the game goes\nSome will page you put in strange codes\nFuck for pesos ven aqui can I see\nEvery time we get together gotta spend a G\nYou gotta pay for the room and pay for the meal its like a catch 22 yo\nGettin slayed in the deal\nMama behind closed doors find no flaws\nI can hold mine down question is can you hold yours?\n\n(chorus)\n\nVerse 3:\n\nI got winter bitches summer biches a hundred bitches\nTrickin on them with McDonalds number sixes\nSuper size'em for the fly ones\nIntroduce them to the hood those prepared to hear sirens\nEpisodes choker chains x and o's\nI got'em coming back my sex exceptional\n21 and up overnight stays in The Honeycut\nThey don't need a man they just wanna fuck\nOutlaws opened up lke mouth sores\nPicture me switching up my style southpaw\nForget it hoe a real nigga never give you doe\nI kiss your cheek tell you not this week my shit is low\nHit the exit sorry we don't play like that\nThought we came to party? nah ma we ain't like that\nI change chics like I change kicks I know it's bugged\nBut I once had love before it came to this\n\n(chorus 2x)"}], "artist": "Nature"}
