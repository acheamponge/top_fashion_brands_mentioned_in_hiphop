Just scoping out for a bit\nYeah Psych, you used to have the TEC with the good pants?\nYou know, we was just hungry like that\nToo tired of shooting in the air cause I can't get my way and shit\n\n[Intro: A$AP Ferg]\nGrandma hid that hammer in her mattress from my uncle\nHe would listen to Wu-Tang 'fore walkin' in the jungle\nArmy fatigue jacket, kitchen knife, hope he don't cut you\nWith a deuce-deuce up in his boot in case he get in tussles\n\n[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]\n(And he will!) Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang\n(And he will!)  Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang\n(And he will!) Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang\n(And he will!) Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang\n\n[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]\nLightpost workout, how he turned out\nGranddaddy tried to help him but he burnt out\nHe screamed, \"Lazy fucker, won't you try to get a job?\"\nBlock party where the hoochies turned out\nThey would dance and sweat they perm out\nIf they scream, \"We got beef\" he would handle with no prob\nCologne and liquor was his odor, fragrance of a ridin' soldier\nODB was his persona, he was high on Mars\n40 ounce and then some marijuana\nWhen grandma died from pneumonia\nNow his life a roller coaster, put that shit on God\n\n[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]\n(And he will!) Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang\n(And he will!) Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang\n(And he will!) Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang\n(And he will!) Let it bang, let it bang, let it bang\n\n[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]\nUhh, bruh, I miss my crackhead uncle\nSold him dope in by the bundles\nDraw down on him, his own gun though\nFuck about family, where's my Hundo?\n'Fore my clip go knock-knock zero\nFake nigga talkin' 'bout Q ain't real\n18 slangin' that Coupe Deville\nYoung nigga, young nigga move that dope\nYoung nigga might get killed\nCuz ain't payin' my bills, heat make the beef get grilled\n12 years clutchin' that steel\nPop a nigga more than them pills\nPistol under sheet when I sleep\nBody niggas like I do beats\nI ain't talkin' bout my uncle, this me\nMade another million this week\nSwagger make a Bentley look cheap\nI'm the reason why your momma OD'd\nI'm the reason why your homies ain't deep\nNow you wanna talk about peace\nPimpin' bitches all in these streets\nWonderin' why you rubbin' her feet\nIf you got high off what I sold\nHow his teeth platinum when he on shit row?\nBig belly ballin' like I'm still gettin' throwed\nLeave a nigga flat 'til his body get towed\nSad that the curtain got closed\nLeave him with a hole in his skull\n\n[Outro: ScHoolboy Q]\nLet it bang, let it bang, let it bang\nLet it bang, let it bang, let it bang\nLet it bang, let it bang, let it bang\nLet it bang, let it bang, let it bang\nUh, yeah", "year": "2016-03-25"}]}
