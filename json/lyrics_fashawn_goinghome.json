Hopefully in my prime\nPray nothing happen like some static\nI be strapped in case it happens\nWith a magnum for you maggots can't kick that\n\n[Hook: Fashawn]\n\n[Verse 2: Fashawn]\nSometimes I feel like I'm writing my life away\nIn the studio night and day, lighting haze\nSpit it like I'm twice my age\nAnd all I need is a mic and a stage\nSome would say I ain't sane\nSick of these airplanes, automobiles and these trains, shit\nMaybe I'm right, then again, maybe I'm wrong\nAnother day 'nother song, fuck I'm taking too long\nI guess what happens some more madness\nAutomatic like I got it like an addict\nI have it like some static as soon as I get home, yeah\n\nWon't be happy until til I get home, yeah\nWon't be happy until til I get home\nWon't be happy until til I get ho-oo-oo-oo-oome, oh\nWon't be happy until til I get home, yeah\nWon't be happy until til I get ho-oo-oo-oo-oome, oh", "title": "Going Home"}]}
