"[Intro: Belle]\nA sunset in Paris\nA life that's so careless\nWord from the terrace\nWatching the sunset in Paris\nA sunset in Paris\nA life that's so careless\nWord from the terrace\nWatching the sunset in Paris\n\n[Verse 1: Cadet]\nAight, look!\nSo much has changed in the last year and I'm still adjusting\nI never felt like a fuckboy but when I look back man I must've been\nCause me I weren't chasing a dream\nI was working the nine-to-five for some pricks and like\nThey couldn't care about me\nI was just another person to give a payslip\nThat 33.3 percent cycle of work, music and doing road but like\nWork ain't shit and I can't do road for the rest of my life and I shoulda known because\nMe and my boy can do grimey shit\nAnd that night he'd be kipping\nBut it's like my conscience, it would keep me awake\nAnd that's how I know we different\nYou see look\nMe, I've been around road yutes\nAnd they love talking 'bout road (road)\nAnd me I've been around trap yutes\nAnd they love talking 'bout trap (trap)\nAnd I don't love road like those road yutes\nAnd I can't trap like those trap yutes\nAin't no soft shit, I just know who I am\nThe same way them niggas can't rap like man\nBut music I know that I do love so look\nI'ma go chase me a dream\nI'ma give it everything that I got\nIf it don't work I'ma do road, it'll be what it be\nAnyway you know the build-up\nSo now I drop \"Slut\" and get a bit of attention\nBut I ain't used to this Twitter shit\nHe's teaching me how to reply to mentions\nLike don't reply to that chick\nDon't reply to that bitch\nHe's a troll he chat shit\nNah I never knew about this\nI just know about bars I just know I wanna spit\nBut anyway look I'm in my motion\nVideo after video and shit's going well look I'm in my motion\nGiving the game so much emotion, but\n\n[Chorus: Cadet]\nThey say when you start doing well people start changing\nI can have a hundred phone calls, but only one conversation\nThere's only one road to riches\nThere's only one way to make it, see\nEverybody fame-chasing but\nThey didn't wanna trade places with me\nAnd now they wanna trade places with me\nBut I need this and I breathe this me\nYeah this is me\n\n[Verse 2: Cadet]\nA hundred phone calls but one conversation\nAight, that shit might make no sense, 'aight let me explain\nNow everybody wanna question the kid\nAnd them hugs turn into open hands it's like\nNinety-nine phone calls to ask for a favour, one phone call to ask how I am\nNow everybody wanna put on events and tell me how I can be the hardest\nAnd wow look\nOut of the blue it's mad look, everybody knows how to manage a artist\nThey talk to me like I'm a business plan\nBut I don't want this man I need this, my\nBackup plan is jail or a dead-end job\nI swear to you man I need this and\nI ain't in this 'ting just for the money\nIt's all I got, no funny shit\nLike rudeboy this is my life on the line\nAnd my life is not your money flip\nSo I beg you don't take my 'ting for joke, cuh\nMy life this 'ting done ain't funny\nSee I look around and see bare sprinters but\nMe I'm trained for the marathon\nSo of course I'm sticking around\nI can't get a nine-to-five doing the deadest shifts\nI'll be writing bars all over man's notes\nAnd getting fired for not selling shit\nAnd like now they call me a story-teller\nAre you fucking stupid?\nJust because I don't tell you lies about trap\nDon't mean you can categorise me as that\nThat ain't 'a' story, that's 'my' story\nAnd this shit it might not be known to you\nBut a real artist, giving you his honest story, what man is supposed to do\nBut that ain't even most reckless 'ting:\nI be up every night on a restless 'ting, I'm\nReally tryna get rid of tickets\nBut they're phoning me like \"Can you get man in?\" Oh!\nWhen it's somebody that you know it's a no\nBut for Bryson Tiller you be waiting by the phone no-show\nSee I won't complain but know when I buss don't say you supported from before\n\n[Interlude (Spoken): Cadet]\nBut know that I'm grateful for every view that I've had\nCause I remember getting a thousand views on YouTube and being gassed\nYou see, I'm overwhelmed and I'm grateful\nBut I burnt bridges of the wasteful\nWho would snap girls bringing bottles to the table\nBut they never bring nothing to the table (but)\n\n[Chorus: Cadet]\nThey say when you start doing well people start changing\nI can have a hundred phone calls, but only one conversation\nThere's only one road to riches\nThere's only one way to make it, see\nEverybody fame-chasing but\nThey didn't wanna trade places with me\nAnd now they wanna trade places with me\nBut I need this and I breathe this me\nYeah, yeah this is me (oh yeah)\n\n[Verse 3: Cadet]\nMaybe I learnt too late\nI got a candle that I'm really tryna burn two ways\nAnd now they say I'm not grime man I get it cause don't do shit in a commercial way\nAnd normally if I get nicked I'm like 'calm, just another night in a station'\nBut the last time I got nicked\nI was like 'man I'm fucking up man's situation\nWhich I can't do, are you dumb?\nOnly gotta learn once\nBecause if my words can change the world\nThen why the fuck am I biting my tongue\nAnd I swear if you ask me for a pic, word I won't say no\nBecause I remember being that same yute that you would ask to take the pic on the phone, no shit\nNow they're saying that a nigga skilled cuz I'm talking 'bout shit that's really real\nYou see look\nThey're satisfied if they give you a hook\nBut I'm satisfied when I give a nigga thrills, no chill\nThis is what I'm talking about\nI get passionate when I'm talking about\nMy life, see\nMusic I need this 'ting\nAnd that feeling in your chest, I'm talking about\nSo, no\nI won't go back to the roads them\nGetting back to the road\nDo another wrong shit for the right reason\nBut for the right reason, man would get cracked on the road\nThere's no more kitchen knives in the house\nBig red hair in the back of the coat\nGrabbing a car and driving past feds\nGetting that lump in the back of my throat, so no\nI ain't going out like that (I'm Cadet)\nI know I ain't born that way\nSo plan A's to be a fucking legend\nAnd plan B is man's plan A\nYou see, this is my sunset in Paris\nI won't stop until I own the game\nLike as much MC's as you want\nMe and them yutes we are not the same\nMan, I'm different!\n\n[Chorus: Cadet]\nThey say when you start doing well people start changing\nI can have a hundred phone calls, but only one conversation (one conversation)\nThere's only one road to riches (uh)\nThere's only one way to make it (one way)\nEverybody fame-chasing but\nThey didn't wanna trade places with me, uh\nAnd now they wanna trade places with me\nBut I need this and I breathe this, this is me (I need this!)\nYeah this is me, uh\nYeah this is me"}]}
