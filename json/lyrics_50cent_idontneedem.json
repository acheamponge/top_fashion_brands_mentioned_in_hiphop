Nigga is there.. is there a motherfuckin' problem nigga?)\n(Oh, yeah that's what I, I thought so.. pussy!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nNiggas be talkin 'bout me, they always callin' me crazy\nFuck them OG niggas, they stuck in the 80's\nSayin they gon' do me somethin', now you know that's a lie\nNigga you look at me wrong I let the hammer fly\nI'm rich, I still wake up, with crime on my mind\nQueens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime\nWhen I say move, nigga move, or get caught in the crossfire\nI prevents runnin', cut my fuckin' hand on the barbed wire\nThis shit's crazy, it's just a different day it's the same shit\nHollow-tip partin' yo' head, leave your whole fuckin' brain split\nThey sick, they see me in that Aston Martin\nWhat's the matter? They can't get that hooptie started\nThought they was grindin', well God damn, where that money at?\nThought you was fucked up, cause you was lettin' paper stack\nYou ain't a hustler, matter fact, you's a buster\nI don't trust ya, I should send niggas to touch ya\n\n[Chorus]\nI tell niggas to suck my dick, get the fuck out my face\n'Cause I don't need 'em\n'Cause they're, never around, when I'm down\nShot and I'm bleedin'\n\n[Outro]\nWhat? Who say they gon' do somethin' to me?\nMust be out your rabbit-ass mind\nFuck around kill one of these niggas", "year": "2005-03-03"}]}
