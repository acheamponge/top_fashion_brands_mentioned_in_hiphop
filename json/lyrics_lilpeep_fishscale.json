Aye, aye\nGeekin' out that fishscale, aye, aye\nI'm just sittin' in the hallway\nI'm just sittin' in the hallway\nI'm just sittin' in the hallway\nI'm just sittin' in the hallway\n\n[Verse: Lil Peep]\nWipe off all that fishscale\nWhen they get me, won't you pay my bail\nBitch, I get it in the fuckin' mail\nLike my bitches thick, but I'm so frail\nIf I counted all the blunts I smoked\nIf I counted all the hearts I broke\nIf you've doubted I'ma make you choke\nOn your words for free\nI ain't come with a fee, not me, not me\nCatch me in the stairway\nI'm on that I don't fuckin' care way\nIt's like three up in my time zone\nIt's like three up in my styrofoam"}], "artist": "Lil Peep"}
