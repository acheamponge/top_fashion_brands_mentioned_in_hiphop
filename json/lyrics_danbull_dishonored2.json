Incrimination\nImplication? Incarceration\nIt\u2019s an illustration of the inculcated inconsideration\nIncubated in us since her installation\nThe inauguration initiated intensification\nOf inebriation imitating inspiration\nIntoxication, impersonates invigoration\nInstrumental in inhibiting imagination\nInnovation replaced with irritation\nInfatuation with infuriation\nIllumination with immolation\nIncineration and inhalation of the vapour\u2019s incapacitation\nI\u2019m impudent indemnification\u2019s insolent incarnation\nYour argument just is invalidation\n\n[Hook]\n\nTake back what\u2019s yours\nWalk through floors walls and locked doors\nTake back what\u2019s yours\n\u2018Til warm water pours from all your pores\nTake back what\u2019s yours\nAll aboard, pull the oars, \u2018til we storm all your shores\nTake back what\u2019s yours\n\u2018Til your foes crawl gory floors on all fours", "year": "2016-11-10"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
