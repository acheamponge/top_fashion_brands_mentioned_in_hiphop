I can rap, I'm not mean, but you're whack\nIn the backseat, cypher's hyper on the track\nWee!\n\n[Hook: Kitty Pryde]\nWee, I can rap, wee-wee, I can rap\nI'm not mean, but you're whack, mean-mean, but you're whack\nWee-wee, I can rap, wee-wee, I can rap\nI'm not mean, but you're whack, mean-mean, but you're whack\n\n[Verse 2: Riff Raff]\nWhen it comes to hateful words, I got skin like a rhinoceros\nDiamonds on my binder, fourth grade I was immaculate\nReading, writing, arithmetic; my favorite? Mathematics\nMarked my paper more than average\nYou bastard rappers you should go play in traffic\nThe way I ball, I could've played for Toronto Raptors\nOlympic swimmers from Nigeria, emeralds in my ears\nSo far from clear 'cause they resemble frozen lettuce\n91 degrees out in Belgium, you ever seen melted lime jello?\nDid I confuse you losers? I pull up in the candy relish\nRap game Peppermint Patty and the lavender bumble bee jackets\nYour girlfriend's vagina smells like Bumble Bee tuna\nShe duct taped me to the dumpster\nOtherwise I woulda left sooner\nRiff\n\n[Hook: Kitty Pryde]\nWee, I can rap, wee-wee, I can rap\nI'm not mean, but you're whack, mean-mean, but you're whack\nWee-wee, I can rap, wee-wee, I can rap\nI'm not mean, but you're whack, mean-mean, but you're whack"}]}
