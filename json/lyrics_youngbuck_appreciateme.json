{"songs": [{"title": "Appreciate Me", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nWe just products of our environment, you dig?\nSurvival is the mission and success is the reward, niggas, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nKill or be killed, we was raised this way\nEither eat or get ate, gotta live this way\nIs you real or you fake? Ain't no in-betweens\nCan't let this white man world fuck up a nigga dreams\nI got bills and they late, sellin' weight to these fiends\nSay it's love but it's hate, this shit ain't what it seems\nAin't no in-betweens (Ain't no in-betweens)\nSo in this white man world, can't let 'em fuck up a nigga dreams\nAppreciate me\nFuck 'em, I done came up from nothin'\nIn these projects still hustlin', motherfucker\nThe ghetto appreciate me\nAlways got my name up in somethin'\nAnd they know how I'm comin', they tryna fuck up a nigga dreams\n\n[Verse 1]\nHomicide had no clue\nBetter hope that they catch him before I do\nPut a seed inside these motherfuckin' projects and it grew\nHad to get up out these motherfuckin' projects so I flew\nAnd everybody ain't gon' keep it solid, you gotta push through\nWatched how drivin' with no license turned into an indictment\nSeven misdemeanors sent a nigga back on violation\nWatch them tears start to fall, she was full of excitement\nIt's her birthday, and her husband's handcuffed in y'all's station\nFood stamps for sale, who got some food stamps for sale?\nShe just tryna feed the kids, you know, while you rot in jail\nAnd this judge wanna judge me but you not from here\nDo you know how many people got shot this year? (Buckshots)\n\n[Chorus]\nKill or be killed, we was raised this way\nEither eat or get ate, gotta live this way\nIs you real or you fake? Ain't no in-betweens\nCan't let this white man world fuck up a nigga dreams\nI got bills and they late, sellin' weight to these fiends\nSay it's love but it's hate, this shit ain't what it seems\nAin't no in-betweens (Ain't no in-betweens)\nSo in this white man world, can't let 'em fuck up a nigga dreams\nAppreciate me\nFuck 'em, I done came up from nothin'\nIn these projects still hustlin', motherfucker\nThe ghetto appreciate me\nAlways got my name up in somethin'\nAnd they know how I'm comin', they tryna fuck up a nigga dreams\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhat it do?\nWe be stealing and killing for revenue\nAnd I know I could do better but it's you that sell it too\nAnd you tell me 'bout this devil while you standing on this pew\nBut as soon as the service over, you go and sin again\nWe just callin' out for help, migo, please send 'em in\nThey don't have no idea what conditions we living in\nI learned from all my lessons, this is now, that was then\nI done counted all my blessings, I'm like, \"Lord, I'm cashing in\"\nLet me fly, or these niggas just gon' continue to die\nIn your city with some pounds, in the venue with this nine\nAnd I know these niggas clowns, can't look me in my eye\nNo lie, since you niggas wanna know why\n\n[Chorus]\nThe ghetto appreciate me\nFuck 'em, I done came up from nothin'\nIn these projects still hustlin', motherfucker\nThe ghetto appreciate me\nAlways got my name up in somethin'\nAnd they know how I'm comin', they tryna fuck up a nigga dreams\nKill or be killed, we was raised this way\nEither eat or get ate, gotta live this way\nIs you real or you fake? Ain't no in-betweens\nCan't let this white man world fuck up a nigga dreams\nI got bills and they late, sellin' weight to these fiends\nSay it's love but it's hate, this shit ain't what it seems\nAin't no in-betweens (Ain't no in-betweens)\nSo in this white man world, can't let 'em fuck up a nigga dreams\nAppreciate me\nFuck 'em, I done came up from nothin'\nIn these projects still hustlin', motherfucker\nThe ghetto appreciate me\nAlways got my name up in somethin'\nAnd they know how I'm comin', they tryna fuck up a nigga dreams", "album": "Compulsive", "year": "2019-04-12", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dd1510ec0f7e89e04c124e916b495b47.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young Buck"}
