Rap!\n\n[Talking]\nI spit a lot of gangsta shit, but, you know, I like to refer to it more as just reality rap, you know what I'm sayin'? And if you ask me how long is that gonna stay around, that's always gonna be around\n\n[Intro]\nY'all gon' feel me on this one\nAight, real, real rap\nFuck is the deal, man?\n\n[Verse]\nIt's game over, raw coke on the mirror by the [?]\nTwo dames on my shoulders, they hanging over, they training yoga\nSexin' them crazy, I'm sinking colas, I'm yanking molars\nLike I'm supposed to, my main soldier swinging his toasters\nNigga hard, cold as a polar bear's, bake from the rover\nThree-leaf clovers if you ever thought my reign was over\nThe pipe game, I have him flying with his stinking odor\n[We light the things when the Viking reigns with baking soda???]\nI push a button on your life like it's a game controller\nMahogany bed with a mommy on the spread\nI'm a monster nigga, turned into a zombie for this bread\nDon't think I'm claiming I'm banging cause their Mazi's bloody red\nThe sawed-off double-barrel filled up with double lead\nFuck blowing your head off, I'll blow your body from your head\n\n[Hook]\nIt's the return of a don\nGot nothing but dick for the world\nA kiss for mixing me wrong\nIt's the return of a don\nHomie, a rink is nothing\nIf [he pink his something??], thanks for nothing\nIt's the return of a don\nGo in and tell every slinger [?] that holds pimps\nTricks are charms\nIt's the return of a don\nAnd he about to get dirty\nThe hand goes as pearly, I'm going in early, I mean it"}]}
