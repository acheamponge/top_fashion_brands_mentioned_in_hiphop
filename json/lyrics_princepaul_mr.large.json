Kelly a Rolex with a diamond bezzy\nRock steady, beg me, consider me stern\nThe original hoodlum, Fishburne had to learn\nSupersperm, court's adjourned for the knowledge\n(You, you got what I need!) Let her toss your salad\nBig hittas love to sit wit big figgas\nI love black people, but I can't stand niggas\nThe Ozz heads, back me, and cock Shocky\nReady to hold it down, I pop niggas like acne\nPay a token to breathe, Apollo with no creed\nFor every government nigga, there's government cheese\nI'm Mr. Please, Mr. Large, thirty foot garage\nMercedes Beggy, mad Teddy, Mr. Elly!\n(PEACE!)", "year": "1999-02-23"}]}
