Your body is holdin' it\nA chemical dependency, no way to get over it\nIt's chemical\n\n[Hook] (x2)\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnthrax, death threats, X, enhance sex\nSteroids effects pecs, abs, and biceps\nAdvil relieves pain, trees deceive brains\nAdd a little chemical, you start to see things\nWater filled with fluoride will fix up your teeth\nHormones are gettin' pumped in pigs, chicken, and beef\nAlcohol slurs words, Mydol controls birds\nXanax calms your nerves if your brain's disturbed\nVitamin C for health, to take care of yourself\nAnd you can even cure AIDS if you got enough wealth\nFood coloring tricks you, glucose addicts you\nAll the dirty shit in food is why your clothes don't fit you\nRed Bull pumps your energy, weed fucks with memory\nCoke mixed with Hennessy turns friends to enemies\nPills to stop pregnancies, slow the flow steadily\nIncredible, we're based on a chemical dependency\nIt's chemical\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2006-03-21"}]}
