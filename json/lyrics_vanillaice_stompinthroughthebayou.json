STOMP!\nStompin thru the bayou [x4]\n\n[Verse 2]\nNo more of the bullshit, I don\u2019t give a fuck\nPeople steal all I take and that really sucks\nI can see your schemes, you false prophets\nFuck the American dream, that shit is toxic\nI split bones in half, keep you in boxes\nStomping through the bayou\nNo one can stop this!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nFeel how I do it, keep you flowing like fluid\nBlew up in 9 deuce and I\u2019m still true to it\nAre you stupid? The enemy thought they could stop me\nEnemy is sloppy so I came back like Rocky Balboa\nI show you how it really goes down\nTake it 12 rounds, turn it into a ghost town - hellbound\nHere comes a hell hound for your heart\nI rip you apart don\u2019t get caught after dark\n\n[Bridge]\nCause I\u2019m\u2026\nCause I...\nSTOMP! STOMP!\nWith my big black boots on! [x2]\n\nSTOMP! STOMP!\nStompin thru the Bayou\nSTOMP! STOMP!\n\n[Verse 4]\nI got what you want and every thing you need\nCome and follow me thru this society\nHear me holler and scream until your ears bleed\nSee me stompin at you I know you fear me [x2]\n\n[Hook]", "album": "Hard to Swallow", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e0d05f3e83ddfbe093566581f485f027.1000x1000x1.jpg"}]}
