SHIT!\"\nShe's off the hook, I would dress her decently\nBut look her body is immaculate I'm attackin it from all positions\nOf thinkin inside my mind-ah\nHopefully it won't be too inappropriate if I walk over there and say\n\"Excuse me, can I have your number please?\nI'll get on my knees if I have to\"\nShe'll laugh through, the whole episode\nJust then I knew I had her locked (down)\nNo cock-blocking please this one's mine (uh)\nDimepiece and shit son, shorty was fine\nEvery line of mine was like a rhyme I wouldn't lie I swear\nSparklin the whole time as I whispered in her ear\n\nChorus: repeat 2X", "year": null}]}
