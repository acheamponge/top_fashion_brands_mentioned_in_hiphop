The last you spoke to him was about 05 I believe.What goes around comes around.It was Camu who ousted you from WM when you were stealing from Yak and Tame on The Teen Wolf Tour and it was Camu who named you \u201cSLOB BLOB SWEAT PANTS\u201d If you use this day as a day to remember you should remember how you wronged a dying man with Cancer before AND after his death\nYou use my beloved friends passing as a fucking tag line in your interviews and it is Vast Aire who I am talking about in Nothing left to say\nThat was for you Mu\n\n\n\nI am deleting this section. I was extremely angry this morning and I lashed out. I shouldn\u2019t have and I know it\u2019s still out there. I know Camu would be laughing at this because this was right up his alley but I was wrong. I guess in doing this I felt closer to Mu. I wasn\u2019t advised by my publicist to write this, I am doing so on my own accordance. This is a day to remember the fallen. It was childish to indulge in this negative act of hatred\n\nI apologize\n\nBelieve me there is no other reason I am taking this down.I don\u2019t want to promote this sort of thing and it will ultimately bring me back to a negative path\n\nC.Palko\n\nA message to Theodore Arrington becauseI was blocked on his myspace:\n\nI attacked you unsolicited and I should have let it be.I miss Camu that much.You can keep your threats up if you like and attack me if you are hurt by the blog.This has nothing to do with anyone else you attacked in your blog I acted alone.There is no need for your racist remarks either,thats just pointless.I was wrong to disturb a day of remembering people we lost. If you do smack my hair wait a little while,I just got it cut\n\nPeace\n\nI will NOT approve slander against this dude in comments\n\nPeople make mistakes\n\n\n\nVast Aire\n\n\n\nFUCK CAGE & WEATHERMEN\nFirst off RIP TO CAMU TAO-, i know how close we were, and i dont have to flash it over the net, like some of these fake wannabe\u2019s\nCage shitted DEF JUX, he used to shit on EL-P & EL-P\u2019s girlfriend kathrine!!! who works for BIZ 3 ENT.

SA SMASH HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY FAM!\n\nIts sad to know these kids are holding mad shit in their little heads,  all i know is NOBODY can say i stole anything!!! you should get the facts before you run your mouth and make a fool out of yourself, you should be thinking about your transformer \u201cbuddy\u201d and not me!\n\nHow could i steal form tame? who told you that your girlfriend yak ballz?\n\nAll you do is talk shit on a comp, or a 2-way, this is why you dont know shit\n\nBut its cool\n\nI will see you-\n\nV-\n\n\n\nFIRST, PEACE LOVE AND RESPECT TO CAMU TAO {R.I.P.}\n\nI would like to say i never started any beef, but i will put an end to it\nIm going to answer some questions from the fans so a basic understanding can be reached\n\nWHY DID YOU LEAVE DEF JUX? AND WHEN?\n\nI left def jux in late 2002 / 2003, i started working on my lp \u201cLook Mom No Hands\u201d\nAt this time, me and camu {SA SMASH} were living together in BKNY. camu was working on \u201cSmashy Trashy\u201d his only lp on Def jux. at the time, Def jux was trying to expand their amount of artist, and they started giving out \u201crecording advances\u201d. at the time COLD VEIN had sold over 100,000 cd\u2019s and a maxi single of the F-word sold about 30,000 at the time {140,000 records sold}\n\nCan ox at the time didn't have a \u201cdeal\u201d, we recorded everything as friends, but we blew up over night, and def jux didn't know how to handle it, so you can imagine that can ox was mad! {CAN OX WAS ONLY MAKING MONEY FROM SHOWS}\n\nWe built this label with you {el-p} but your giving money to outsiders first????\nDEF JUX SHOULD HAVE PAID CAN OX AND RJD2 BEFORE YOU PAID MURS AND 9TH WONDER, C-RAYZ AND ETC? {PEACE TO THEM, IM JUST MAKING A POINT}\n\nAt this time, dj Mr Len told me that El-p\u2019s biz-partner {DEF JUX / OZONE} Ameechi stole $5000 from co-flow, and this is why MR LEN didn't hang around or do cuts for def jux any more!!!!\n\nSo, its 3 years after my great lp {cold vein} blows up, but el-p and ameechi dont have any money for me and vordul??????? but more than 5 groups are getting advances????\nAND MR LEN SAID $5000 WAS GONE! DUE TO AMEECHI!???\n\nTHAT STARTED A HUGE BEEF! me and el-p had some VERBAL fights, and i moved to red hook brooklyn. this is when me camu and metro had a crib, they moved from ohio to do their lp for def jux\n\nCAN OX GOT A LAWYER AND THEIR MONEY\u2026but the vibe was different, its like when your girl friend catches you cheating, its never the same after that! we should have never had to chase our own money!!!! we could record as friends, but when it was time to pay me i was told to get a lawyer?????\n\nSo we {can ox} wanted to move forward, but when it wasn't the biz problems, we had creative problems and lack of control\n\nEl-p is a control freak, if he can't produced every song, he starts to throw fits! at this time {2003} im getting crazy ill beats from Mf doom, Madlib, Ayatollah Camu tao etc\nI wasn't thinking about el-p, his sound was dope, but its was limited. it was the same type of style, i wanted something new, and i wanted control! hence the name LOOK MOM NO HANDS! all that meant was \u201cfreedom\u201d at def jux in those days, el-p was censoring a line or 2 out of dudes rhymes. i watched him do it to camu tao and vordul mega!\n\nEl-p told camu tao he could not \u201cslap a girl\u201d in his rap song, and he told vordul \u201cyou put to many \u2018nigga\u2019s\u2019 in your raps\u201d\n\nThe last thing i needed was some emo white kid telling me how many \u2018niggas\u2019 i can have in my rap songs! and one of my favorite hip hop songs is \u201ctop billing\u201d and in that song milk says very clearly \u201cif your girl is out of line\u2026its your girl i slap\u201d and as far as black people using the word \u2018nigga\u2019 Q-tip already broke that down! so ME CAMU AND VORDUl hated that day! this is why i left def jux bad biz and lack of creative control!\n\nWHAT WENT DOWN WITH CAN OX\u2019S 2ND RECORD?\n\nTo be real, we started that project, but vordul dropped the ball on that, vordul became very distant and was drunk and coked up all the time, he became this way after his jaw was broken in a bar fight that was ment for el-p. long story short, that helped wake up vorduls \u201cdark side\u201d and we only did like 5 songs. El-p got mad at me as if i should have been vordul\u2019s baby sitter! vordul is a grown man, he made his choices, dont get mad at me! so then we had our final fall out and the last thing we recorded was Mr Lif\u2019s songs \u201cBrothaz rmx wit can ox\u201d me and vordul are cool, and we still are recording! thats my family! he\u2019s on my new lp \u201cOX 2010\u2033\n\nWHY DID YOU LEAVE WEATHERMEN CREW?\n\nAT THIS TIME\u2026.I WASNT ON DEF JUX BUT I WAS STILL A WEATHERMAN MEMBER!\nI did a Tour with SSS {TAME ONE AND D-DONS in late 2006} with my homie 4th p, it was called the teen wolf tour, it was fun and cool, but then it turned for the worst!\nCage claims i took money from yak ballz and tame one????\nAccording to whom since cage wasn't on the tour??????\n\nThe tour was set up for me to get an average of about $850 a night {i was told i was going to get $1000 to head line, but i left it alone because im wit my peoples, SO I THOUGHT}\n\nOne of the shows was not part of the tour, it was a show i already had as a solo artist, but i added it to the tour {teen wolf tour} long story short, I should have gotten $900 dollars that night, but yak ballz felt i should take $750. now\u2026.i understand yak ballz was paying for extra gas {and i was also} and i understand that yak was feeding Tame one {and so was i} but he had no right to to try and get more money from a show that was never his? he got the same money he got every night, that $150 or $75 bucks had nothing to do with him? AND ITS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO STEAL MY OWN MONEY!\n\nSo if that makes me a crook, then im muthafuckin robin hood!\nI dont have anything to hide! i gave yak the $150 THE NEXT DAY! we had 4 more shows and i wanted to dead the beef, but i made it clear it was my money to begin with!\n\nAlso on that same tour we had dinner at a mexican spot, and we all are talking about projects etc. i told every one at the table {yak included} that i didn't like aesop\u2019s new lp at the time {bazooka tooth} I LOVE AESOP! but i didn't like that record, all i said was \u201cyou can't hear his words anymore\u201d and yak turned that into me being a hater!!!!\n\nMeanwhile all these bitch emo kids do is talk shit about you in emails, blogs and or 2-ways!\n\nTame showed me a 2-way convo with cage trying to get votes to kick me out of weathermen! THATS RIGHT TAME SHOWED ME A 2-WAY EMAIL WIT CAGE TRYING TO VOTE ME OUT! SO BEFORE THE ELECTION WAS DONE, I LEFT THE NEW LEFT. BECAUSE I KNEW THEY WERE ALL FAKES\n\nAT THE END OF THE DAY IF CAMU HATED ME, WHY IS HIS RIGHT HAND MAN {METRO} CLOSE FRIENDS WITH ME AND IS ON MY NEW LP? WHY AM I STILL COOL WITH ALL OF CAMU\u2019S OHIO PEOPLES LIKE BIG JT!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nMETRO IS PROOF THAT ME AND CAMU WERE GOOD, HOW ELSE DID I GET MY BEATS FOR MIGHTY JOSEPH {BLOOD SPORT PROD BY CAMU!}\n\nTHE ONLY LIARS AND CROOKS HERE ARE THESE EMO BITCHES!\n\nLike i said before if they are angels that never did nothing wrong\n\nWHERE IS\n\nSPACE?\nBIG JUS?\nMR LEN?\nJ-TREDS?\nBREEZLY BREWIN?\nC-RAYZ?\nMASAI BEY?\nMURS?\nRJD2?\nCAN OX?\nMR LIF?\nAND B.M.S.?\n\nNONE OF THEM WORK WITH DEF JUX ANYMORE\u2026LETS BE REAL ABOUT THIS!\n\nAnd look at cage\u2019s history!!!!\n\nHe worked with NECRO?\nAnd HIGH AND MIGHTY?\n\n\u2026ONLY TO TURN ON THEM???\n\nHE TURNED ON COPY, MASAI BEY, B.M.S. SPACE AND ME!\n\nJUST THINK ABOUT HOW CAMU FELT WHEN EL-P\u2019S CENSORSHIP DESTROYED SMASHY TRASHY THE LP! CAMU HATED DEF JUX\u2019S CENSORSHIP, IF HE HATED ANYTHING AT ALL!\n\nWHAT TYPE OF RECORD LABEL IS THAT???\nAND I CANT BE DOWN WITH A CREW OF \u201cYES MEN\u201d\n\nIF I DONT LIKE YOUR BEAT I DONT LIKE IT, YOU FUCKING EMO BITCH!\nAND EL-P IS A BITCH BECAUSE HE KNOWS CAGE SHITTED ON HIM!!!! BUT HE KISSES HIS ASS!\n\nANY REAL FAN CAN LOOK AT THE PATTERNS AND FIGURE IT OUT!\n\nLAST BUT NOT LEAST, I HAVE A SECRET UNRELEASED \u201cBLAIR COSBY\u201d SONG OF CAMU TAO DISSING DEF JUX AND EL-P!\n\nBUT, DID I RELEASE IT, NO!\n\nIM GONNA LET THEM KEEP DIGGING THEIR SHIT HOLE\nAND THEN IM GOING PRESS PLAY AND BRING CAMU BACK TO LIFE DISSING THEM!\n\nIF IM A LIAR, ASK METRO!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\nPEACE-\n\nOX 2010 COMING SOON!\n\nREAL RAP IS BACK!\n\n\n\n\"Battle of the Planets\"\n\n\n\nEl-P\n\n\n\nOk\nI have never wanted to participate in any sort of public ugliness with people i once considered friends.  its negative and builds nothing.  its only purpose is to hurt.  its a shallow action.  a desperate attempt to satisfy the ugliest parts of your ego.  there is no example of me disparaging, insulting, blaming, defaming or casting doubt on anyones character who i\u2019ve had any type of real love for and considered crew at one point no matter how things may have turned out\u2026 no matter what they may say about me or what i may think about them behind the scenes. for me, i always thought it made one look small and angry.  i always felt like that type of public ranting and vitriol reflected failure, weakness, insecurity and pettiness and i\u2019ve seriously regretted it when i\u2019ve been involved in anything that resembles that, even peripherally.  as good as it feels in the moment it almost always backfires.  the same person who (non artistically) desperately seeks public affirmation of his anger and resentment ends up actually hurting himself more in the eyes of the strangers he\u2019s trying to communicate with.  by the same token, defending yourself against that type of attack plays right in to the whole thing and immediately puts you on the same level as the person attacking you.  beyond that the fact is that for me,  the relationships that i\u2019ve had in my life that have fallen apart make me sad, not angry.  the friendships that have ended in my life are a source of huge regret for me and i constantly wonder if there was something i could have done to change the outcome. so i don\u2019t have it in me to kick and scream and curse the world for not handing me everything i think i deserve.  i\u2019ll do that in my music, if need be.  its better that way.  that much i have learned\n\nI\u2019m also not the type of person who feels like he\u2019s a victim of circumstance.  every choice made along the line has different results.  it seems irrational and immature to me to create a world in ones head in which somehow, magically, there is an external reason that justifies every single reality of your life\u2026 and not one of those reasons is you.  a world in which you are just in every action and innocent in every interaction.  a life in which you only consider and retain the ideas that justify your perspective and completely ignore all other realities that exist and might, if you took a moment to consider them, make any (rational) person think a little longer before they lashed out and tried to destroy some one else\u2019s character\n\nIt takes a special type of ego to literally delude oneself in to thinking that you have the moral right of way in every scenario.  it takes clinical insanity to think things are one way when in fact they are the opposite.  for instance:\n\nLets say (as a metaphor, of course) someone was morbidly obese but thought he was a ninja.  that would be kind of crazy, wouldn\u2019t it?  or if that morbidly obese person didn\u2019t make the connection between his eating habits and his weight.  crazy.  now if that same massively, morbidly obese person walked around calling people who were less than half his weight \u201cfat\u201d, how should they react?  on the one hand its obviously crazy for this hugely fat man to be calling you fat.  but on the other hand he keeps fucking saying it.  over and over.  to anyone who will listen\n\nI\u2019ve tried to ignore it.  i\u2019ve tried to squash it.  i\u2019ve tried to take the high road because i assumed that like me, everyone must have better things to occupy their time with.  apparently not.  every other day there is a new vitriolic rant aimed at dismantling me or someone i care about, despite the fact that i haven\u2019t fired one single shot in the direction they are coming from.  not one\n\nNow i don\u2019t have any interest in trying to make anyone see things the way i see them or arguing about/defending the past.  i won't do the back and forth point by point defense with someone whos only path to generate any type of publicity for himself seems to be exactly that type of public argument.  a person who literally is interviewing himself in order to push a smear campaign forward.  a man who has made it his personal mission in life to focus all his energy on the very people who were close to the friend he claims to have loved with a constant barrage of misspelled and badly punctuated lies, insults, accusations, epithets, slander and threats.  someone who seemingly has no humility or perspective on his own fallibility.  someone whos anger has driven him to the edge of sanity.  whos own life is seemingly so joyless and directionless that the only thing he can think to do is reach out and try and inflict pain\n\nAnd by the way, when i say \u201cclose to the friend he claims to have loved\u201d i mean close.  I\u2019m talking that our lives will never be the same close.  the real deal.  the kind that comes with pain no one wants and that no one with a soul would brag about as though it were a credibility issue or as though love were something you had to prove as opposed to just feel.  not the idea constructed to make you feel good about yourself or justify your perspective in the eyes of other people or yourself.  friendship isn\u2019t the collective little favors you\u2019ve done for someone that you keep record of and hold against them even after they die.  its not a song you may have recorded with someone years ago and its not a conversation you may have had.  its bigger than that\n\nIts sad to me that you, and you know who you are, don\u2019t understand that.  its painful to sit here and take your abuse knowing the true nature of your character and how utterly easy it would be to expose it.  the temptation to publish certain correspondences you\u2019ve been a part of is overwhelming.  i have no doubt in my mind that any one who would see those would walk away from reading them with a very different perspective on your moral fiber and your character in general.  a younger me would do it in a heartbeat.  and yet what good would come out of it?  what are we all trying to prove to each other?  it would only lead to even more ranting, more insults and more bullshit.  no one would learn a thing and i would have wasted another minute of my life\n\nAnd i don\u2019t hate you.  i don\u2019t want to hurt or destroy you.  you were my friend.  i wanted you to succeed.  now i just find you to be a sad character.  twisted, angry and resentful and squandering your time on mean spirited pursuits.  its depressing\n\nNow i\u2019m sure the person i\u2019m writing this all about will just respond in his usual manner after reading this.  denial, anger, threats, capital letters, misused question marks and exclamation points and more accusations.  but i\u2019ve got a suggestion for a better way to proceed\u2026 just let it go.  you\u2019ve gotten your rocks off.  you\u2019ve said your peace.  now make some music.  stop lecturing the world and contribute while you still have time.  none of this shit means anything.  at all.  go make the art you believe in and spend not one more second trying to take other people down or blaming people for the place you find yourself in life.  spend time with and cherish the people you love while they are still alive so you dont find yourself feeling like you have to defend the validity of your commitment to them after they\u2019re gone.  be grateful for the things you have and wish no man harm.  be happy or die trying.  i know i will\n\nBy the way if you truly did love Camu and were close to him then I\u2019m sure you feel the same pain my friends and i do.  if that really is the case then I\u2019m sure the futility of arguing and fighting with people has never been more obvious to you.  it is to me\n\nIf you loved him then you are one of us\u2026 the heartbroken members of a club we never wanted to join\u2026 and I\u2019m sorry for your loss\n\nEl\n\nPs:  im not going to be approving comments about this blog.  i didn\u2019t write it to rally people against anyone or to create \u201csides\u201d\n\nPps:  this is the only thing i have to say and i won't engage in any more and i won't be leaving this blog up for long\n\n\n\nMr. Len\n\n\n\nWant to set the record straight. I have no problems with Amaechi, El-P, or Def Jux. In fact, I did a little voiceover on EL-P\u2019s last record. Amaechi didn\u2019t steal money from Co. Flow. He and I have worked out our issue and its not anything for Vast to speak on. I can\u2019t speak for anyone else, but as far as things with Mr. Len go, there are no problems. Not sure what is going on with Vast, but I\u2019d appreciate if my name was left out of all things foolish. ie drama and beef"}]}
