You cats cannot be me it's only one me\nLook at they face now! Stupid! All of them!\nI'm not the second nobody , it's one me\nI told you it was gon happen!\nYou can be that way if you want , it's me\nNow look at they face! Look at them crawlin on they knees!\nSigel\n\n[Beanie Mac]\nWhy niggas can't never just play they part\nGotta be the first ones that say they talk\nSay they said , first ones to say they did\nCan't never be they self gotta play that kid\nYou know the same young buck you let touch the coke\nAnd now that he come up he wanna cut your throat\nAnd you gave from the block , put em to your neck\nNow he givin you a Glock puttin it to your neck\nYou know that same bitch said don't fuck with him\nThat nigga no good ain't no trust in him\nTwo days later see her in a truck with him\nTwo years later now that bitch stuck with twins\nThat nigga been broke wide now she fuck his friends\nGot a lap dance in bars and touch them ends\nTime uncovered a veil over people's plots\nAnd the dumb shit they do to get on top\n\nCHORUS: Nafeisa and Beanie Mac\nEverybody wants to be a star\nEverybody wanna be a star , don't wanna be who they are\nEverybody wants to be a star\nEvery bitch wanna hop in your car , every hater wanna give you scars\n\n[Beanie Mac]\nMan every fucking day , these no flow niggas\nAlways in my face , with they promo niggas\nI thought I told y'all , I don't know Jigga\nI'm not Beanie Sigel , and I don't flow neither\nWhat happened to your keys and dreams of being cracklords\nNow it's Trinities , MP's and trackboards\nI switched my hustle to get this cream\nNow everybody and they mom wanna spit 16\nI got niggas wastin they change to get in this game\nLike shit gon change when they get in this game\nYou think it's just rhymes and beats\nMan this shit's stress time and heat , deadlines to meet\nEverybody wanna come cry to me , come spit they little lines to me\nYou shouldn't of lied to me , naw dog you can't rhyme wit me\nLike you tied to me , like I don't see what you tryin na be\n\nCHORUS (addition)\nStop tryin na be a star, be who you are\nMaybe you will go a little far\n\n[Beanie Mac]\nMan I ain't gon lie I thought all the glitz was gold\nAnd like Jay (I watched the truth unfold)\nAnd now that I got a little time in with this rhymin\nI found out everything that shine ain't a diamond\nEverything that come in a jar ain't dro\nAin't no use you spittin them bars you can't flow\nAin't no use you gettin that R if it don't glow\nAnd ain't no use you gettin a car if you can't go\nGet out the streets , haters will draw you back\nLike an automatic weapon that'll pull you back\nLoad somethin in the brain just to see you snap\nI try to maintain but I see they trap\nSee they plot , you can see me not\nYou can be me not , niggas wanna see me popped , see me locked\nSee me in the block , send me shots , do anything to be on top\n\nCHORUS", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a5d876dd3d88aa58a26a93ff8e32c391.500x500x1.jpg", "year": "2000-02-29", "title": "Everybody Wanna Be A Star", "album": "The Truth"}]}
