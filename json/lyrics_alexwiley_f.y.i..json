Tell me where you tryna go\nGot a big bank roll\nTell me whatcha know\nGuess I'm trash at origami cause my paper never fold\nBig bank roll\nTell me whatcha know\nWould you put it on ya' soul? Tell me where you tryna go\nGot a big bank roll\nTell me whatcha know\nGuess I'm trash at origami cause my paper never fold\n\n[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]\n[?] Tiramisu for breakfast\nGucci fendi on my shoulders\nSmell the Folgers\nStarted seein' the pyramid schemes all folding before me\nLike terrible shoppers\nI'm holding my horses, the weight of it with [?] chakras not folding for [?]\nI can't just pair with impostors and move with my soul\nWhen I paint nocturnal those forces\nNo fashion my niggas all saints\nWe passin' the dank\nAnd my glasses all [?] little gold flakes in my ash sweep the whole swank\nTunnel vision, I'm a long way from Shawshank\nWatch the coupe crawl, know I came up out the crawlspace\nCurveball, I'm in y'all face\nAin't never had the clone don't make that fake mistake\n\n[Chorus: Mick Jenkins]\nMy name means nothing\nI think my age means nothing\nI think my rage means nothing\nI think, we all crave substance\nI think the weed is all I need\nI use the dutches as crutches\nI'm living fuck your instructions\nI'm living fuck your instructions\nI'm livin-\nFuck your instructions I'm livin'\n\n[Bridge: Alex Wiley]\nBig bank roll\nTell me whatcha know\nWould you put it on ya' soul?
