He is 15 years old, he has to watch this and this is put all over the outlets.\n\n[Verse]\nThey ain't never gone respect me\nI know they never gone protect me\nDamn, and I'm just hoping they arrest me\nThat's better than getting shot and forgot about the next week\nAin't try'na be no hashtag\nSee they keep opening these wounds and then they tell us to get past that\nI think I finally got it clear, I gotta get rid of my fears\nIf we gone shed the first tear we better get the last laugh\nFlashback to the guns up in my face\nIt's crazy that we still running cause our race\nThey love that we so blind that they tell us to go in silence\nTell us be open minded to another closed case\nSlow paced, but I tripped on my own conscience\nDamn man, I'm dealing with my own problems\nI walking 'round like I'm this great dad, what my friends don't know is my kid just said Bompton\nI hope I caught it quick enough to stop it\nI swear I gotta show him change through this nonsense\nThe shit that really got me hot is how you niggas make these songs about killers just for profit\nStop it, I don't even want to get asked 'bout it\nIt's hard enough for me to rap 'bout it\nWithout me thinking I'm a hypocrite, I should be out here in this shit\nNot trying to make a track 'bout it\nMmm, woah, that's why I feel like I ain't shit\n\n[Outro]\nIt's good cops and bad cops\nThe bad cops, the good cops don't ever really say shit\nSame shit man\nOh man\nThat's why I feel like I ain't shit\nIt's good cops and bad cops\nThe bad cops, the good cops don't ever really say shit\nSame shit man", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3cb07c9cb666936f414b593e34c62a96.300x300x1.jpg"}]}
