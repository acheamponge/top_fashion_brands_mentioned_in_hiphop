I'm from the dark side\nIf one of us got drama homie we all ride\nAt my cousin's funeral we all cried\nPapoose ain't been the same since Strong died\nI just hop in the Maybach and ride\nBrooklyn is mine I'm bout to take back the Stuy\nNever gave nothing say I gotta payback but why\nOnly thing I got to do homie is stay black and die\n\n[Hook]\nI'm from the dark side\nDark side, dark side, dark side, dark side, dark side\nI'm from the dark side\nDark side, dark side, dark side, dark side, dark side\nThe lights went out, the lights went out\nThe lights went out, nigga the lights went out\nI said the lights went, the lights went out\nThe lights went out, homie the lights went out\n\n[Verse 2]\nAsk Stevie Wonder he gon tell you when I die\nI'm so gifted they gon put a ribbon in the sky\nNever shy to a fight, you talk a lot\nYou can catch this fade, barbershop\nSet your crib on fire, the doors is locked\nYou can't open the door cause the knob is hot\nI got that rubber grip on me, marvelous Glock\nI be backing out on them, parking spot\nMore heart than Kevin, my bars is hot\nY'all rappers really comedians, Chocolate Drop\nClip loaded to the top I bet you see\nIt's better when it's fully loaded like an SUV\nSomebody ever made you real mad?\nAnd you totally spazzed out on they ass\nNow they sorry tryna apologize\nDeep down inside everybody got a dark side\n\n[Hook]\nI'm from the dark side\nDark side, dark side, dark side, dark side, dark side\nI'm from the dark side\nDark side, dark side, dark side, dark side, dark side\nThe lights went out, the lights went out\nThe lights went out, nigga the lights went out\nI said the lights went, the lights went out\nThe lights went out, homie the lights went out", "year": "2016-10-06"}]}
