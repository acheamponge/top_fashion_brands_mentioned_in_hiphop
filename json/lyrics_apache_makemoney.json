Fuck it, put it on his credit card\nTell me who do you prefer, a man or a mack?\nOn the flip-flop, don't stop to shop at Jack's\nWith sex appeal, be real I don't understand\nFake hair and nails, and you're lookin for a real man\nSome dance for dollars, holla cause I know you know\nCause some plain old hoes just FUCK for dough\nUse your imagination, why think small\nInstead of takin half, fuck it, why not take it all?\nDon't be a dumb broad, a fraud, a phony\nYou just end broke, no blunt to smoke, and lonely\nUse your pussy as a tool, that's how you want it G\nDon't waste it, put it on sale, but never free\nFuck your way to the top, don't be a slob\nIf none of that shit works, then fuck it, buy the job\nIt takes more to be a rich bitch with big tits\nIf your man is broke, don't listen to his bullshit\nSpeakin of men, we know how to make the money\nBut it's up to you to take it honey\n\n[Pretty Tone Capone]\nWord to mother my motherfuckin man just told you what you had to do\nSo if you wanna just lay back and be blazed\nYou'll damn sure play the fool\nYou think we won't fuck the shit out of you bitches?\nYou better get real, word to mother\nWhat the fuck's up, what the fuck is goin on with that shit?\nA crook is 'sposed to have his hand in your motherfuckin pocketbook\nPlay yourself out\n\n(Make money money, make money money money)\n(Take money, take money)\n(Make money money, make money money money)", "year": "1993-02-09"}]}
