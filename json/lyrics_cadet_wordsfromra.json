I need a Barclay\nMake P's off a blue square, that's [?]\nThe hardest guy since R.A, like R.A, so\n[?] jail, on New Year's Eve, but there's mice everywhere\n[?] but I ain't there, [?] but I ain't there\nLegend's in the building, the legends are in the building\n\n[Skit: R.A (Real Artillery)]\n\"Yeah, it's R.A, a real dark ting. The hardest that ever done it and still does it. Obviously, we're talking 'bout this grime ting, innit, but I'm talking 'bout this garage ting, we're talking 'bout this gangster grime. We setted that crud off beats. We setted that talking wicked on riddims. We setted that all, darg. 'Nough MCs coming up now, no diss, but don't wan' take the homage. It's cool though. But like I said, it's a Southside ting to the end, Southside of the bridge. My brudda could then. He came up off the dun, he never came up on that free shit, so I have to go find him. So like I said, Commitment 2\u2013I'm cosigning him, I'm giving him the torch. Remember dat, shell it down. Anyobdy who's got a problem with that, come see me.\""}]}
