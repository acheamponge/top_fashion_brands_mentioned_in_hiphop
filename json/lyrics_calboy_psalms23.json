Ayy\nThey get to blastin', them we gon' flag 'em, told a lil' bitch I'm with Chill, don't panic\nBig four, nigga, do real big damage, shoot him in his face, better close his casket\nBoy, you in the field, but I tote your ratchet, nigga diss the gang, let a fuck nigga have it\nI was on the block totin' guns with the savages, big Draco, that's fully automatic\nOn my say so, those lil' niggas blastin', big drip on me, check out my fashion\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga, I walk through the valley of the dark with the TEC on me\nAyy, ayy, I was 16 boolin' at the park with a check on me\nAyy, trippin' with the gang, I'ma send a couple shots, leave you stretched on me\nAyy, prayed to the Lord that I'd see better days, now I'm blessed on me\n\n[Outro]\nJTK"}]}
