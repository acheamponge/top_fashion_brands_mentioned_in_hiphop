Split between six ladies\nAnd my mother had the stocks till the 1980's\nIf Stonewall pays my phone calls\nIf San Juan fills my Scantron\nIf every molten shower out in Okinawa fueled by smoking powder\nPays my broken power send my folks the flowers\nIf it's irrelevant to my intelligence\nGimme a shotgun, I'm dropping these pink elephants\nI'll take a tranquilizer shot and sell the sedatives\nOut in Delaware I'm well aware the fella lives\n(And what if Iwo Jima)\nAll the skeletons in my closet are dead relatives\n(And if the Fall of Saigon)\nAnd then I grow up to be another screw up\n(And if the Tet Offensive)\nBut if I blow up\nIt'll be cause they blew up\n\n[Hook]\nMy mother loves me more than Hercules\nMy parents work harder than Hercules\nBut if I think of this as burglary\nI know I'm stronger cause of Hercules", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3433966a73a598eca7e6120b7f0cbab3.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Guilty Pleasures", "title": "Hercules"}]}
