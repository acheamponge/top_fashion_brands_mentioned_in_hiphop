Why\u2019d you let me go?\u201d\nAnd I, I never have the answers\nI hear your screams like tears falling from the mountains\nIn your eyes such a sharp, sharp pain\nI can hear and feel you die, hear you calling\nI hear you calling, but I can\u2019t save you\nI can\u2019t save you\nI can\u2019t save you one more time\nI can\u2019t look you in your eyes and tell you, \u201cThings will be alright.\u201d\nI can\u2019t feed you any lines\nGet you hooked and reel you in, just to throw you back again and watch you drown\nAll over again\nAnd I\u2019m mentally reclined in my mind\nPreviewing memories of the times when we almost had it\nWhen all it took was to grasp it\nWhen all it took was to grab it\nClench your fist so tightly around that bliss and be happy\nBut somehow the sands of time slipped through our fabric, and stained our existence with that of it\u2019s own\nIt was running out on top of us\nSlowly running out on top of us\nAnd if you can hear me cry in this poem, disregard it\nBecause this is the part where my heart will harden\nWhat do you do with a heart you can\u2019t feel?\nWho do you give it to?\nHow do you live with it?\nI\u2019m guilt trippin\u2019\nI\u2019ve packed bags full of sadness\nRemorse, my anger won\u2019t let me see past it\nMy bloodshot eyes are so tired, I can\u2019t seem to see straight\nIt was not supposed to be this way\nIt cannot be this way\nI remember finding sun in your eyes\nThe stars in your smile\nI could walk for miles along the concrete just staring into them\nAnd now I play keyboards like pianos typing symphonies of misery\nInstrumenting our memories\nPraying that you\u2019ll remember me\nPraying that you\u2019ll remember me when my years run out\nWhen our cycle discontinues\nWhen your fears run out\nPraying that you\u2019ll remember me when you move on\nPraying I\u2019m still your weakness when you grow strong\nNever let your heart run out on you\nNever let your heart run out on you\u2026", "year": null}]}
