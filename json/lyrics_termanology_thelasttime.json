When all I wanna do is grab a biscuit\nAnd let six spit, I won't miss shit\nDoc telling me chill, it's for ya own good\nDrugs, liquor, fucking raw, no good\nBut I'm sick of facing the judge\nI'm sick of faking this love\nI'm sick of taking these drugs\n\n[Hook]\nI drove home drunk, but it's the last time\nI drove home drunk, last time (it's time)\nI drove home drunk, but it's the last time\nI drove home drunk"}], "artist": "Termanology"}
