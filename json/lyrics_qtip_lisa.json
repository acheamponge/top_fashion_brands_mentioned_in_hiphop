And that\u2019s the questions that I ask\nMakes you wanna be a better you, and makes the good times last\nCan you see him inside of you, I mean, you feel him when he\u2019s gone?\nI\u2019m feeling we\u2019re a lost cause, and I\u2019m hoping that I\u2019m wrong, but\u2026\n\n[Chorus]\nLisa left me with just a half-smile\nOnly half of her heart the whole while\nLisa listened but she ain\u2019t hear me\nThis is going too far, be near me\n\n[Bridge]\nLisa, only tried to show you my heart\nLisa, only tried to show you I care\nLisa, only tried to show you my heart\nLisa, only tried to show you I care\nLisa, only tried to show you my heart\nLisa, only tried to show you I care\nLisa, only tried to show you my heart\nLisa\u2026oh\u2026\n\n[Chorus]\n\u2026left me with just a half-smile\nOnly half of her heart the whole while\nShe would listen but she ain\u2019t hear me\nThis is going too far, be near me\n\nBe near me (Repeat until end)"}], "artist": "Q-Tip"}
