El-P - \u201cFirst Words Worse\u201d\n[Emcee(s): C-Rayz Walz and El-P]\n[Producer(s): Catch22 and E-Cleazy]\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nThe truth is y\u2019all haters had to lie to do it\nI\u2019m loose like this loop is with a loot chick grinding to it\nOld-school like Colt 45, lunch lines, and Pumas.  You heard\nI blazed who?  (What?) I deny the rumors.  Your mic\nDon\u2019t sound nice\u2014you shouldn\u2019t even check one, two\nI\u2019ll disrespect who come through.  My intellect is kung fu\nIn the midst of the women that miss the man, a new\nMillennium bush baby with a mystic plan.  Digi, digi\nDownload, SoundScan exams, top-ten choice\nI wanna speak out\u2014my label keeps getting my invoice, and if\nI sound sarcastic, I meant to do it.  Wack\nEmcees\u2019 breath stink\u2014yeah, they need a mint recruitment\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nRevenge of\nThe first, rap, hip hop\nUnderground, mainstream.  Stop, lick a shot\nPop, hit the charts, aim for the top\nAnd still get down when we drop\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\n(Why not?) I got\nDifferent flows for different shows\nYou don\u2019t know the half\u2014(Why?)\u2014I\u2019m different on a whole\nI\u2019ll use a knife to cut class, but if the fight\u2019s not ending, these old-\n-school slugs can get your life suspended.  You\u2019re not\nSafe with the ninja\u2019s hatred agenda.  Fix your shape\nUp (Go \u2018head, go \u2018head), put your face in a blender.  There\u2019s no\nSuch thing as friendly contradiction.  My competition\nLoses consciousness of composition.  While I\u2019m on the\nToilet with an L, my shit is smoking.  I got\nGrown folks laughing\u2014they think the kid\u2019s joking\nBut I won't dumb it down to double my dollars.  I'd rather\nPiss on your lawn than leave a puddle in my boxers\nGet knocked out before round one\u2019s begun just for\nGetting smart with me, and you sound dumb.  Melon-head\nCoward, motherfuck your honeydew crew that\u2019s looking\nNo need to fight you, fool\u2014my cough is whooping\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nRevenge of\nThe words, rap, hip hop\nUnderground, mainstream.  Stop, lick a shot\nPop, hit the charts, aim for the top\nAnd still get down when we drop\n\n[Verse 3: El-P]\nYo, when I rap, you\u2019ll hear\nSpaceships and Martians and lasers and targets\nI\u2019ll face-fuck your bitch squad, lace anal compartments\nComic books, bibles, barcodes, orphans\nThis little tyrannical spitter living distorted\nDisc wanna live in the clearing of sin fortress\nBrooklynites babble on crass, blast portraits\nMeanwhile, back in a boxcutter for tongue talk\nMicrocosm/Micro \u2018cause I\u2019m awesome plus dumb bop\nYoung cop rookie, the PJ beat nerve-rack\nTension.  The city of stress depressed, words slap\nBrethren.  .45 dust dirty dumb shit\nAnalog funk shit puncture.  Run, bitch\nCover.  The cloud of defeat complete hovers\nJuxie slow burn, slow-mo flow colors\nRookie, no run.  Just, son, suck something\nEl-Product album of raw saw destruction\nIt\u2019s coming\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nRevenge of\nThe worse, rap, hip hop\nUnderground, mainstream.  Stop, lick a shot\nPop, hit the charts, aim for the top\nAnd still get down when we drop\n\n[Outro: C-Rayz Walz]\nAnd this\nVerse is the soundtrack to sickness.  I\u2019ll give it to\nAll y\u2019all who think you can't get it"}]}
