All the time\nI can't even fight it\nTo tell you the truth, I'm rather excited\nI ran home, grab my notebook started to write it\nCause it's so clear to me, when you're here with me\nAll I wanna do is hug you, feel your body near to me\nThis is how I wanna be, maybe growin' old with me\nI don't care if I'm 80 I'll serenade you with Jodeci\nIt really doesn't matter what my friends think\nIf it wasn't real I wouldn't waste the pen's ink\nCause you're so beautiful, that's nothing new to you\nBe careful how I treat you and I'll always be true to you\n\n[Hook] - 2X\n\n[Verse 3]\nI know you might be skeptical but stop you buggin'\nIt's like Pete Rock and C.L., lots of lovin'\nA perfect symmetry of life balancin' within the wake\nFirst kiss, first date, cause Earth to shake\nAnd that's how I feel for you, I'm only bein' real with you\nI'mma stand beside you when no one else can deal with you\nYou know that was written for you, even know I'm jokin'\nYou're the first girl that had me really opened\nCause you're perfect even if you ain't perfect, understand ?\nI'm attempting to explain this the best way that I can\nA lot of people try to impress you and show off their surface\nBut they're shallow, short-term and probably turn out worthless\nVersus me, cause I'mma do anything you want me to\nJust to be close to you, I'll expose my soul to you\nSleep when I'm holdin' you, deep when I talk to you\nAnd sweet when I roll for you, but what do I gotta do...\n\n[Hook] - 4X", "year": null}]}
