Cole]\nIt took me all day to find some inspiration\nIt just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation\nProblem with the game now, there ain't no innovation\nI see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation\nAnd they say that\u2019s flattering but I ain't flattered at all\nMatter fact y\u2019all need to practice that more\nSee my man Nate, ask me if I gained weight, I said nah\nMy pockets got fatter, that\u2019s all\nMoney was an issue but now that that\u2019s solved, I ball, I ball\nLike Kobe in the fall\nPut trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantel\nDawg my shows be off the handle\nTake the proceeds, go to gamble, ha\nBet it all black, and pray I quadruple my salary\nIf I win maybe then I can pay Sallie Mae\nTold her I be dealing with some real life shit\nShe be asking when, bitch, when I feel like it\nCole World, Cole life, Cole blooded\nI be on my shit and look at all the hoes love it\nGot a hundred fifty bitches in the club staring at me\nHow that feel? Very happy (very happy)\n\n[Verse 2: J.
