Gypsy rap, Gypsy need her dollar back\nAnd all of that, my devil is only closer when I call him back\nLiquor in a limelight, look her in the limelight\nWith fine wine and ecstasy, you can have the rest of me\nBasket case silhouette, cigarette, internet\nCheck my twitter page for something holier than black death\nWho am I? Gypsy black, the vacancy of hallelu\nMe hollow in my interviews\nMe only wearing tennis shoes to clubs with dress codes\nCause fuck they clubs\nEverything is everything, me Noname, you niggas doing cocaine\nMe missing brother Mike, like something heavy\nMe heart just wasn't ready; I wish I was a kid again\n\n[Chorus: Akenya, TheMIND & Noname]\nWhen the sun is going down\nWhen the dark is out to stay\nI picture your smile, like it was yesterday\nWhen the sun is going down\nWhen the dark is out to stay\nI picture your smile, like it was yesterday\n\n[Verse 2: Noname]\nWhen I remember memories don't last forever\nWhen I deny my empty with an open letter\nWho gon remember me? My satellite, my empathy\nThe wheels be chrome, chrome spiffy, the Lord with me\nMy halo said goodbye and the floor hit me\nFill the lining in the pine box, my granny fill the time slot\n\"Don't grow up too soon\nDon't blow the candles out, don't let them cops get you\"\nMy granny almost Sparrow I can see the wings\nThe choir sings, and la da di la di da da da, dah\nOnly He can save my soul\n\n[Refrain: Noname]\nAnd I know the money don't really make me whole\nThe magazine covers drenched in gold\nThe dreams of granny in mansion and happy\nThe little things I need to save my soul\n\n[Chorus: Akenya, TheMIND & Noname]\nWhen the sun is going down\nWhen the dark is out to stay\nI picture your smile, like it was yesterday\nWhen the sun is going down\nWhen the dark is out to stay\nI picture your smile, like it was yesterday\n\n[Outro: Noname, Akenya & TheMIND]\nWhen the sun is\nWhen the sun is\nWhen the sun is\nWhen the sun is going down"}], "artist": "Noname"}
