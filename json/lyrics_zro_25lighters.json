hot on Post Oak\nBack in the day I had a pocket full of rocks\n24/7 365 around the clock\nAbout to get paid stackin' up my paper\nI hit a lick and then it's time for me to lay low\nIn front of my screen on 360 playing Halo\nHoes'll drop it like it's hot when ever I say so\n'Cause I'm the man diamond on my hand\nGot big bass in the back of the blue van\nIt's blue over gold the story's being told\nBenjamin Franklin Andrew Jackson in by billfold\nMy flow is real cold I ain't never been whack\nAnd thanks to Bun B and Pimp C I got two gold plaques\nThey hangin' on my wall, Pimp I miss you
