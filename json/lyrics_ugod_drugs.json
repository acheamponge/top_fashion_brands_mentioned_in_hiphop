No, I just needed to freeze\nThen I dibbled in this, then I dabbled in that\nThen the next thing you know, I was exposed to crack\nAnd I guess curiosity killed the cat\nAnd the way that it look, ain't no turning back\nAnd I used to have the hook up, g'sll splurge\nNow, I just cook up to feed my herbs\nNow, people just look up, like he's the third\nCuz he walk around town like he's a bird\nInstead of money it was drugs that he prefered\nSay no to the substance, heed my words\n\n[Chorus 2X: U-God]\nI don't love the drugs, drugs love me\nIt's the coke, and the weed, and the ecstasy\nIt's a terrible disease, that go down down deep\nAnd all day long it be calling me\n\n[U-God]\nMy father, he had dope fiend arms\nLord, thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus for moms\nDamn, I did her wrong, not a pot to piss in\nAnd the, TV's missing, couldn't stop the addiction\nDamn, that cause friction, I broke the trust\nHuh, how could I tell her that I smoked it up\nAnd I smoked the red dust, to fight the demons\nAnd I need a head rush, cuz tonight I'm fiending\nNot for the nicotine, the pipe I'm screaming\nAnd the monkey on my back, can't fight the feeling\nAnd I did a robbery, I broke the clip\nAnd I caught a lottery ticket and smoked the dip\nLife fucked up, nigga, I choked my bitch\nPolice tried to cuff me and I broke the stick\nI'm as low as I can get, low as I can get, nigga\nLow, low, need another hit, nigga\n\n[Chorus 2X]\n\n[U-God]\nI love getting high, throwing dick to dames\nLived life to the fullest like my name Rick James\nI don't know what's more addictive, the chicks, the fame\nDamn, I done shamed my family name\nOne foot in the rain, one foot in the flame\nUgh, rich or poor, whatever you call it\nI'm a cigarette smoker, two sips from alcoholic\nGot to change my ways, flush drugs down the toilet\n\n[Chorus 2X]", "title": "Drugs", "year": null, "album": "Mr. Xcitement"}], "artist": "U-God"}
