Took it with a grain of salt\nI wanted it badly, they couldn't stop me, Indie\nErry label wanted to sign me\nGrew up on Short and Freddie B\n(Who else?) Magic Mike and Calvin T\n\n[Hook: Jay Ant]\nThey used to tell me I couldn't go too far alone\nThey used to always say I couldn't go too far alone\nBut now I'm here, bitch\nThey used to tell me I couldn't go too far alone\nThey used to always say I couldn't go too far alone\nBut now I'm here, bitch\nThey used to tell me I couldn't go too far alone\nThey used to always say I couldn't go too far alone\nBut now I'm here, bitch\n\n[Verse 3: G-Eazy]\nFrom the BART train to a tour bus\nStill the same game except I'm pulling more sluts\nMore butts, more bucks, never giving more fucks\nDid it my way, I'm never taking short cuts\nRaised in that town like fool, who put you upon?\nHuh, E-40, Mac Dre is who I grew up on\nI'm just selling game got you if you need a coupon\nYou can check my resume, see every beat I threw up on\nSmoking on grapes, rollin up swishers, no papes\nBack of the Ghost, closed drapes\nI'm a boss tycoon\nGirls in the crowd all swoon\nSuper high, I'm off to the moon\nAnd I vanished with your girl then I took her to my room\nShe wants me to slay ooh-kay, that means doom\nBoom, and it's to be expected\nKnew this would happen as soon as she texted\n\n[Hook: Jay Ant]\nThey used to tell me I couldn't go too far alone\nThey used to always say I couldn't go too far alone\nBut now I'm here, bitch\nThey used to tell me I couldn't go too far alone\nThey used to always say I couldn't go too far alone\nBut now I'm here, bitch\nThey used to tell me I couldn't go too far alone\nThey used to always say I couldn't go too far alone\nBut now I'm here, bitch"}]}
