Know this ain't the place to ask\"\nWhen she said that shit I had a flashback, back to the past\nMan '07, LAX, first time in the baggage claim\nDon C picked me up off the curb, my bags in hand\nWas nervous as shit, knew I was meeting up with Ye\nAnd we riding through the hills swerve, swervin' and shit\nSeeing the houses on the hills like I'm deserving this shit\nOh boy I'm worth it yeah it's time to put the work in this shit\nOh that was back before I had the G.O.O.D. imprint\nHit the studio with Kanye, that shit was intense\nAnd he said \"Boy you got it, boy you is a prophet\"\nSigned me, got a profit\nFew years later yeah we on and poppin'\nAnd I got a crib off in the same hills we used to drive in\nBrr Brr, call up Don C he was the first to know about it\nAlmost went to TSU with Alesha then I dropped it\nFuck it, I guess everything ain't for everybody\nOh boy, swerve\n\n[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]\nOkay I came up how I came up\nA little change but I ain't change up\nA little fame but I ain't famous\nA little danger now I'm dangerous\nGettin' high now I'm the supplier now\nLaying low cause it won't fade us\nStill living how I'm living cause nigga I need to\nStill feel like I deserve it\nHow I feel like I deserve it\nStill feel like I deserve it\nHow I feel like I deserve it\nStill feel like I deserve it\nStill feel like I deserve it\nStill feel like I deserve it\nStill feel like I deserve it"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
