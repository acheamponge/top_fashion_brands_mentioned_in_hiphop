Can\u2019t you leave this part of my life untouched?\nI thought following You meant I only had to say yes once\nNow everyday I wake up You give me some cross to take up\nYou really want me to break up with my girl? Nah that\u2019s too much\nI know what\u2019s best for me, You don\u2019t understand my complexities\nSee, I gotta make a living so don\u2019t ask where my checks come from\nI hear You talking, I ain't gone numb\nI know I\u2019m in the dark and I gotta find my way to the Son\nCause You\u2019re calling on my name and I know I can\u2019t run\nBut I feel so back and forth\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nBack and forth like a tug of war (yeah)\nCause I\u2019ve been fighting for my life like\nTryna get my life right\nAnd I really want more\nI don\u2019t know, back and forth like a tug of war\nAnd I been fighting for control and fighting for my soul and\nThis is war, it\u2019s a tug of war\n\n[Verse 3]\nA trail of broken hearts, a man full of regrets\nThe thrill has left, the empty promises of sin sets\nYou wanna put treasure inside my hands but You cease\nCause they\u2019re clamped, holding on to sins I won\u2019t release\nI don\u2019t know how to start loving You and stop doing what I\u2019m doing\nIf I gain You tell me what I\u2019m really losing\nYou have to change me in my sin, I never choose Him\nMy heart needs to see something greater than what I\u2019m pursuing so\nIs it true that You give rest to the weary?\nCan you accept and repair me, do you hear me?\nIt\u2019s so clearer now, it\u2019s painfully apparent that I can\u2019t have my sin and my Savior, they\u2019re not for sharing\nAnything that I lose to follow you is not a loss\nMy girlfriend, my friends, my money, even my job\nBut sometimes I believe the lie\nThat God don\u2019t provide for His child when they obey, that\u2019s so cray\nYou calling me to freedom, I think that it\u2019s time to walk\nI don\u2019t see every step but the next is out of the dark\nI\u2019m the filthiest of them all but I\u2019m Yours if you wash me\nFrom that sin by the blood of that cross, I\u2019m yours"}]}
