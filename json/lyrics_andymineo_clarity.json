I'll ask Him when I see Him\nDaily bread, that's per diem, but I'm fastin' like a BM\nRidin' past ya in the P.M. in a stolen car, that's fleein' from the scene of a crime\nApollo Creed, in his prime\nRocky verses, I'm a person that's tryna believe I'm worth it\nI'm workin' through it, but work is, well, work, but well worth it\nIt's hella churches still hell is workin' fine\nWhat's that tell us, fellas hurtin', it's like melanin a crime\nThat's the elephant we hide\nTruthfully, we probably lied\nRather have a tribe than unity, so you and me divide\nI'm hellish and divine\nI'm trellis and the vine\nI'm tellin' me, \"I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm, I know better\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAll I, all I want is clarity, clarity\n'Cause all of my heroes are frauds just like me, just like me\nSo let every man be a liar, let only God be true\nAnd all of your heroes are frauds just like you\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't see through that smoke in the air\nThat's the smoke in the air\nThat's that smoke in the air\nAll that smoke in the air\n\n[Interlude: Madeleine L'Engle]\nThe value of doubt is to keep you open to God's revelations\nIf you don't doubt, you don't change\nIf you have to have finite answers to infinite questions\nUh, you're not gonna move\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, built my life on this (Huh)\nHalf my adult life unlearnin'\nLies that I heard in a dumb sermon\nWhat I unearth got me uncertain\nMore knowledge and more sorrow\nWorryin' that never fixed tomorrow\nJust take away all my strength today\nIt was black and white, but now paint with gray\nMaybe that cloud that I've been stuck in\nI constructed, I conduct it\nOrchestra of noise, I don't hear your voice\nI done made a choice, my consumption\nA TV, tablet, tweetin', twerkin', grammin', gamin', rappin', workin'\nFashion workin', workin', workin', workin'\nCan't tell if I (Lost)\nMy mind or just made it (Lost)\nMy faith or misplaced it (Lost)\nMy pain or upgraded\nLost my happy thought, then I got jaded (Lost)\nFocus in my direction (Lost)\nIn details and perfection (Lost)\nAll my faith in white Jesus and my leaders (Found)\nThey weren't who I thought all these years (Found)\nThey weren't even worthy of tears (Found)\nThe opposite of faith ain't doubt\nIt's when I get it all figured out\nSome days you gettin' all my trust\nSome days I can feel so empty\nSome days I feel like You love me\nSome days I feel like You left me\n\n[Interlude 2: Madeleine L'Engle]\nThe second I'm furious with God, I'm totally close\nBecause you cannot be furious with somebody who's not there\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAll I, all I want is clarity, clarity\n'Cause all of my heroes are frauds just like me, just like me\nSo let every man be a liar, let only God be true\nAnd all of your heroes are frauds just like you\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't see through that smoke in the air\nThat's the smoke in the air\nThat's that smoke in the air\nAll that smoke in the air\nThrough that smoke in the air\nThat's the smoke in the air\nThat's that smoke in the air\nAll that smoke in the air\n\n[Outro: Madeleine L'Engle]\nI want God to wrap me in the everlasting wings and say\n\"There there, it's alright\"\nAnd that cosmic affirmation of\n\"Yes, I know it's terrible, I know it hurts, but be patient, it's gonna work out\nI'm not gonna lose, I'm gonna win, it's alright.\"\nAnd that's the, the, the basic affirmation that I think only true doubters can come to"}]}
