I didn't have to wait in the line at bakery on Sunday mornings anymore for fresh bread. The owner knew who I was with and he'd come from around the counter. No matter how many people were waiting, I was taken care of first. Our neighbors didn't park in our driveway anymore, even though we didn't have a car. I mean at 13, I was making more money than most of the grownups in the neighborhood.  I mean I had more money than I could spend. I had it all!\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm up in the woods\nI'm down on my mind\nI'm building a still\nTo slow down time\nI'm lost in the world\nI'm down on my line\nI'm new in the city\nAnd I'm down for the night\nDown for the night\nSaid shes down for the night\nI'm lost in the world\nI'm down on my line\nI'm new in the city\nAnd I'm down for the night\nDown for the night\nSaid shes down for the night\n\n[Verse]\nLook at my situation, I couldn\u2019t ask for more\nI\u2019m the real Situation, I should be on Jersey Shore\nLook what that kilo sent me, that Porsche is key less entry\nThat girl is high and drunk, I swear the rest is elementary\nWe found a superfreak, no, she won\u2019t know what hit her\nI\u2019m on my Rick James, minus the beads and glitter\nYou\u2019ve got to beg my pardon, this shit here is money talking\nYou don\u2019t get good dick too often, I\u2019mma have you funny walking\nSee that shit I pull up parking, make your neck snap the fuck off and\nDamn, too late you lost it, back to that world you lost in\nBack to that world you lost in\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind\n(Run from the lights, run from the night)\nI'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night\n(Run for your life, down for the night)\nI'm lost in the world, been down my whole life\nI'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night\nDown for the night\nDown for the night\n\nWho will survive in America?\nWho will survive in America?\nWho will survive in America?\nWho will survive in America?\n\n[Outro]\nI'm lost in the world, been down my whole life\nI'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night\nDown for the night\nDown for the night\nI'm lost in the world, been down my whole life\nI'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night\nDown for the night\nDown for the night", "year": null}]}
