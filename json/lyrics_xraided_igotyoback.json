But you don't hear me loc\nSometimes I think I'm goin' down, I need a life preserver\nBut you throw me bricks, tryna help me drown\nBut I survived, what other options do I have?\nCan't blame it on my Mom, can't blame it on my Dad\nI make my own decisions, I chose the path that I walk\nBut me and my father never had that \"man to man\" talk\nBut there ain't no need for me to hate him\nHe did me a favour when he caught my mama ovulatin'\nHe brought me in the world, and the rest is up to me\nSo I'm a, do what I gotta and be all that I can be\nNow I wanted to be a doctor, a lawyer, or a judge\nBut it wasn't meant to be so now I got a grudge\nI was ...(?) for persistence when I asked for persistence\nYou kept me at a distance, so fuck all you bitches\nI don't need none of y'all, I'm a do it on my own\nAnd when I'm ballin', I'm a floss in front of all y'all non-believers\nYou thought I couldn't win\nBut to my homies, my lovers, and my friends\nI got ya back\n\n[Chorus] x2\n\nWhen everybody got they noses up in the air\nI'll be there for you, lettin' you know your nigga cares\nI ain't got much to offer but you welcome to what I have\nDown to ride witcha, even when the homies mad\nI be down witcha; winter, spring, summer, fall\nI'm ready to ride every time that my homie calls\nI never stall on ya dawg, through it all, thick or thin\nWe went from boys to men in the same hood\nSo it's all good, even when you actin' bitchmade\nIt's still on, I'm a ride when you right or wrong\nStandin' strong, no matter what the situation in\nAnd if you die, will provide for your wife and kids\nThat way you live, forever\nHowever, a nigga's never gonna let 'cha rest in peace till we back together\nFuck restin' in peace, I'm in an up roar\nWhat other reason does a nigga have to live for?\nIf you ain't ready to ride for what we believe\nThen get the fuck out the game, it's time for you to leave\nCuz only niggas is willin' to put it all on the line\nAnd ride with us when it's killin' time\nI got yo back loc\n\n[Chorus] x2\n\nX-Raided mad at the world, ready to go to war\nSo tell me what y'all mothafuckas waitin' for?\nPut on your boots, and lace 'em up\nDawg, tell me which tree you wanna chase 'em up\nIt's an organized congregation, committee of the wicked\nIf you ain't ready to ride, then nigga you can't kick it\nSo get the fuck up out the set, you high powered coward\nBefore your bitch ass get devoured\nAt any given hour my soldiers is bound to loc up\nThe warriors gonna ride, and all you bitches gon' choke up\nBut that's the only way to separate the real from the fake\nDon't ask me why, bitch a bitch ...(?)\nThat Northern Cali kill 'em all mentality\nIt ain't my fault, blame it on the criminality\nI'm out to make the paper stack\nAnd when my homie calls, hell yeah it's a conspiracy\nI got his back\n\n[Chorus] x3"}], "artist": "X-Raided"}
