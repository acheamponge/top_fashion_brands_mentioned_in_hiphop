"[Verse]\n\nAaauh aaauh aaauh\n\nThis the story of Ronald\nThe loneliest kid you'll ever meet\nYou'll probably never meet him cause you've never seen him the streets\nRonald stays in the house, been pretty depressed since his dad passed\nAnd left him in the darkness of his room with insecurities\nBut would often consume a fifth of poisonous fumes\nProceeding with an epiphany to beat his mother senselessly\nRonald stuck in the middle\nThe struggle to pull him off of his mother receive pain and dropped it off at the altar\nShe finally realized that she was stuck in the cycle\nAn optimist weighing options of taking her own life\nOr dealing with all the problems\nShe wanted to raise Ronald realizing that domestic violence probably changed Ronald\nIt's monday afternoon 3pm to be exact\nWas exiting the bus where he was bullied by his peers\nEntering the house and walking right into his fears\nSeeing blood drip from the top to the bottom stair\nWith a glare he sees his mother and releases a screech\nHe saw her vein split in half with a blade by her feet\nCouldn't believe the scene that his eyes were forced to receive\nDrops to his knees \"God please let this all be a dream\"\nBut it wasn't and paramedics start arriving to the residence\nHis father already riffing 'bout the cost of the funeral\nAnd now he's in the living room belligerent as usual\nRonald's a punching bag for his dad who's leaving bruises\nThe victim and victimizer, relationship is abusive\nRonald's only 13 with a deprivation of dreams\nHis father's an alcoholic who's more concerned with his liquor\nThan he is his own seed \"Go get me a beer nigga\"\nHis father was complicated he didn't believe in limits\nA man of little conviction who's struggling with addiction\nAnd now become well conditioned from drinking with repetition\nOn a downwards spiral he loads a clip of his rifle\nSaying a prayer like he's searching for forgiveness\nIt's a futile attempt the lord refuses to forgive him\nFor that lifetime of sinning now you praying for repentance\nAll that alcohol dependency was physically depended\nThen he says the hail mary kiss the crucifixion pendants\nPuts the barrel to his chin like this is the end friends\nNow Ronald's left all alone in a system of foster homes\nFull of pedophilic predators, molested on the regular\nTeachers don't understand why he hardly ever speaks\nAnd his grades are getting worse as he academically plummets\nDeveloped a speech impediment of pain he's impervious\nIt's from his foster mother who's sneaking under his covers\nRonald doesn't understand cause he has yet to reach puberty\nConfused by perverted love he receives on the regular\nHe tries to fight the feeling but she always get the best of him\nThis bitch has taken his soul and now there ain't nothing left of him\nSolitude in his room as he sits in the darkest corner\nHe's medicated his pain with strains of marijuana\nRefuse to talk to a pastor, he don't believe in religion\nHe says \"if God resides then my mother would still be living\"\nInstead she left me in hell, the agony of this prison\nNo one understood that was his defensive mechanism\nNot knowing that he wanted to push the pain that he was given\nThe direction of a person that's living without a purpose\nHe made it up in his mind that these motherfuckers deserve it\nIn a world where this child was abused and left deserted\nHe started studying killers such as John Wayne Gacy\nAnd those kids from Columbine he saw 'em as masterminds\nPerfected the blueprint and with the rifle Ronald's accurate\nThe same barrel his father used is now his muse\nHe loads the clip then cocks it as he throws it in the duffel\nSmelling death, teen spirit and a whole lot of trouble\nHe's bumping Marilyn Manson, you could probably feel the treble\nRonald never talks to God conversations with the devil\nLike \"please give me the strength to kill all of these motherfuckers \"\nAs he's walking into school with a fucking mac 11\nHe's done with the disrespect so he's aiming it at ya neck\nPopping plenty of rounds and laying his peers down\nAs the blood starts to puddle, the children begin to huddle\nRunning and dodging the bullets, Ronald's finger on the trigger\nIf he sees you then he pulls it, his classmates are his target\nGun is hotter than august from automatic magazines he's releasing This a massacre\nGenocide of his generation and generally speaking he's giving generous portions of bullets that come and they seek and they singe\nCleansing him of his sins, I'm guessing this is the end\nCause Ronald saved the very last shot for himself\nSo he places the barrel inside the center of his chest\nClose his eyes take a breath and the rest you can attest to\nStory of pain and agony written by yours truly\nThis a treacherous allegory\nI hope you never confuse it, don't lose it"}], "artist": "K.A.A.N."}
