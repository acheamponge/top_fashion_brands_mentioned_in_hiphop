So I can get down for mine\nYou need that, out on the grind all the time\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt was Kangols, Cazelli shades, Pumas and corn braids\nDoo-rags on the waist, brass knuckles, switchblades\nSki mask to get paid, new shells to get sprayed\nHoodrats to get laid, money to get made\nYeah, yeah I had a dream\nI was rich, woke up broke, gun in my hand\nSaying ''damn, dope cost sixty a gram'\nI got to find me a nigga, line me a nigga\nAnd say \"give it up kid, before I put one in your wig\"\nPicture me thirsty, riding 'round foaming out the mouth\nSaying \"I don't get on, I'mma lay a nigga out\"\nNow diamonds are beautiful and pearls are precious\nI hit you and your bitch both over your necklace\nI'm wreckless, I spray the semi drunk off Henny\nWipe your blood off the shines, run and sell 'em to Benny\nFuck with me, y'all niggas know Boo Boo get busy\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, I gave Just a buck-fifty, ask him if I cut niggas\nShootouts in Bedford, ask them if I bucked niggas\nIn four-fifth they call me Boo Boo, the accident baby\nHennessy and cocaine helped to grime me and make me\nMy eyes don't cry, I'm a fatherless child\nGot my ass whooped in Spofford, but never that now\nWhen my name in your mouth you better watch how you talk\nI'll send yo' punk ass to therapy to learn how to walk\nI bust a clip, I'll hit ya hip, I'm takin your shit\nThats how the eses play, for that SSK\nYou probably heard through the grapevine, I'm good out in Watts\nBulletproof shit, cruising through them Compton blocks\nI'm the beast from the East, but I play on the West\nIn the drop by myself with my nine and my vest\nAnd you niggas best be on yo' best behavior\nI was bred for this shit, front on me I'mma blaze ya\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2007-09-11"}]}
