Victoria!\nHow green, how green was my valley?\n\n[Verse 3: Kyote Noir & Butch Arkas]\nHave you ever spoke to god and received a response?\nHave you ever felt like Christianity was a con?\nI'm a beast of the night, a sound of angels when they cry\nI'll sacrifice a lamb, I'll teach a son how to survive\nI put the stings on bees, I put the rings on Saturn\nI put the zest in leaves, I designed your destiny\nYou know the whole last pattern is still following religion\nYou know the [?] in my mind are deeper than you can fathom\n\n[Chorus: alt-J & Daniella Wizard]\nHow green, how green was my valley?\nSoftness in our hymn\nSoft, like coming rain\nSoft, like Bronwen\nVictoria! Victoria!\nHow green, how green was my valley?\n\n[Outro: alt-J & Daniella Wizard]\nHow green, how green was my valley?\nHow green, how green was my valley?\nHow green, how green was my valley?", "title": "Pleader (Mr. Jukes Remix)", "album": null}], "artist": "\u200b\u200balt-J"}
