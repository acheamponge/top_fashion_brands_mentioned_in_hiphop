Celph Titled\n\nI'm Undefeatable, Biggie would even say I'm unbelievable\nPlus quick to flip like Sport Utility Vehicles\nI crush years, so don't ever come near\nCause it was done from the beginning like Father MC's career\nA new title holder is here this year\nAp's raps got more pussies open than pap smears\nThe nicest emcee, you'll never dispute\nCause I've been rappin since the tree on your Timb boots was roots\nI knock more boots than 40 deuce prostitutes\nBut not for loot, only if she's hot and cute\nTry and cock block my game it's complete violation\nCause Apathy's got more hoes/hose than fire stations\nI face off with imitators and take off\nBring more flavor to the beef than steak sauce\nYou think your phatter than Apathy, but you way off\nYou're soft, and you've done more weight loss than Kate Moss\n\nChorus: repeat 4X\n\nLet me tell you about my only vice\nIt has to do with rockin mics and it ain't nuthin nice\n\n[Apathy]\nYour shit's finito, I wrap up beef like a burrito\nUnderground flow, down low, incognito\nThe torpedo, that tore flows, that tore shows\nThrough tore clothes, before blows, through torsos\nIt's Apathy, so large my physical mass occupies\nMultiple galaxies like god off calories\nI cock back, rock raps for dickriders\nMy mic is something you should never pick up like hitchhikers\nAbove average, y'all better practice\nEven weak emcee's consider you the wackest\nI heard your debut joint, your song ain't hot\nIts something that a crackhead would pawn for rock\nI got bombs, with Glocks on lock to blow spots\nMy flow clocks the speed of mach and won't stop\nYou got a lot of hype, but I know you're a flop\nNothin's really gonna happen, like when the ball drops\nYou all stop, you all pussy clot\nMushy as when a cookie drops in milk\nI pop like when rookie cops with Glocks and felt nervous at first\nBut the verses reverses, the guilt from the suckers I killed\nI cop green, last and burn like hot steam\nSpit one rhyme and destroy the pop scene\nYou cum too quick like a teen with hot dreams\nYou wack, while I crack more heads than rock fiends\n\nChorus [4x]\n\n[Apathy]\nI hold power like Imhotep controls magic\nSpin old jazz wax, and spit over static\nI want hip hop to come back and make classics\nNas should spit it like he did for Illmatic\nMy raps add up, like numbers in mathmatics\nI got more tracks than arms of crack addicts\nMy wax acts like an axe hackin up faggots\nIm fly, like the adult stage of maggots\nApathy is the illest on mics its like a habit\nEven ask Ed O.G. \"I Got to Have It\"\nPlanes tailspin to the ground when Ap jacks it\nI bubble your mouth full, like South Pole jackets\nIt's tragic, why you even mess with this rap shit\nNobody wants to fuck with you like busted fat chicks\nYa clips ain't full, when you pull your gat clips\nNow how you gonna battle this, spittin that wack shit\n\nChorus [8x]\n\nDemigodz, Apathy, we on the cut, you know the deal\nMy man Unknown on the ones and twos\nYall suckas can lose\nThere is no competition, y'all know how we do\nIt ain't nuthin nice", "year": null}]}
