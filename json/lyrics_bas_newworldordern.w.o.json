Jealousy a trait saved for you bitch niggas\nSo wait, bitch, hold up, get a hold of this nigga\nJust got out the meeting and they talking big figures\nBut I'ma need more money than these drop a brick niggas\nConvos and commas, convos and K's\nIf that's what you talking, ho, convos for days\nSky so big, got condos in space\nLet's save the world, all in good taste\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd we get paid, that's off words\nAnd I been made, ho, that's my word\nHo, that's my word\nThis shit is for life, N-W-O\nI ain't hitting you back, I'm done with you hoes\nN-W-O\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got us, a worth, that's the truest of it\nA bird lose itself worth, that's the Louie of it\nWhy so materialistic, life will pass you, egotistic\nIt's how the universe work, that's the beauty of it\nSeen you from the first twerk, that's the booty of it\nLately been so hedonistic, give me ass, don't need no friendship\nLiving life, all my tickets copped one way\nAnd these bitches all in my runway\nAs of late, I drink and smoke every day\nHesitate, just another shot you never take\nRiding down the block in the Rari\nTryna' squeeze two hoes besides me\nSix at the club, turned twelve at the hotel\nYou would think these hoes Saimese\nAnd they got homies, bodies\nAnd they roll l's if I let them ride shotty\nCause that's all it would take\nLet's save the world, all in good taste\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd we get paid, that's off words\nAnd I been made, ho, that's my word\nHo, that's my word\nThis shit is for life, N-W-O\nI ain't hitting you back, I'm done with you hoes\nN-W-O\n\n[Outro]\nMe? I'm too fly, y'all sweet, y'all niggas fruit flies\nY'all speak, y'all niggas hoopla, y'all weak, y'all hoop ride\nI must be the coldest, walk up in the room (vroom)\nAnd ya bitch old, I'm looking for some new's\nI must be the coldest, walk up in the room (vroom)\nAnd ya bitch old, I'm looking for some new's", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c8242497a7ae3f9893198c96eeca87b.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "2014-04-24", "title": "New World Order (N.W.O)", "album": "Last Winter"}]}
