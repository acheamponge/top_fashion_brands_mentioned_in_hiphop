I'm sittin' on the couch tonight\nThere's no way I'm gonna get in the car\nAnd go and hang around a bunch of drunk kids at a bar\nThe last time I went, I just wasn't prepared\nThe vibe in the air had me genuinely scared\nI mean, dudes are buff, dudes are mean, dudes are angry\nI held the door open for one, he didn't thank me\nHe was showin' off his biceps\nHe could prolly bench two eighty five for 8 or nine reps\nHe had me feelin' kinda bitch made\nWhen 50 Cent first came out, he was prolly in the fifth grade\nWhen he was playin' truth or dare\nI was buyin' product so I wouldn't lose my hair\nBut I did, I sure the fuck did\nAnd now I feel inadequate around a punk kid\nDamn!\n\n[Hook (x2)]\n\n[Spoken]\nSo that's all life is huh?\nEvery six months go see a new supehero movie\nWork a fuckin' horrible job that you hate\nGet married to someone you're sexually attracted to\nOnly to never have sex with them again once the kids are born\nReally?\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm tryna find what my purpose is for\nBut I spent the last hour at the furniture store\nTryin' to locate a god damn burgundy floor mat\nThat we can put where the bathroom floor's at\nFor the last six months I've had a sore back\nI used to feel, but inside I felt a cord snap\nI used to have a big red heart\nBut now I got a big brown pile where a horse shat\nI used to have a nice young face\nBut now I got a mask that always changes like I'm Rorschach\nI used to want a Porsche\nInstead I had a family\nSo now I'm tryin' to locate where my Ford's at\nSittin' in the home depot parkin' lot\nHumid outside, august night, dark and hot\nThe moon is beautiful this evening it's rare\nBut honestly, I don't even think that I care\nFuck the moon", "year": null, "album": "Congratulations", "title": "Burgundy"}], "artist": "Mac Lethal"}
