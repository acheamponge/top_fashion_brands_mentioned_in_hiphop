Music\n\n[Verse 1: Pusha T]\nYou're sweet to me, diabetes; peace treaties\nBreakfast of champions, they need Wheaties\nCarrying the torch, the Olympic four rings\nI'm a javelin throw from the crowning of the king\nI hear 'em whisper like a hummingbird sings\nOf all the trust issues that a hundred birds bring\nNow the wolves out, hunting for your bling\nAs you preying on the bitches with the lowest self esteem\nIt's a common running theme: victim or vice lord\nDisciple or Black stone, what you look to Christ for\nWe in the last days, fire or the ice storm\nI wear it in my chain as a symbol of a crime lord\nLet's be honest, the cards on the table\nJealousy's a sin, Cain killed Abel\nBackstabber, Caesar had Brutus\nIt's hard to weed 'em out, even Jesus had Judas, gone!", "year": "2011-12-20"}]}
