Right?\nFeelin' too damn high, still I'm glad I'm\n\n[Verse 2: Joe Newman]\nNeon, neon, neon\nA blue neon lamp in a midnight country field\nCows surround so you lean on, lean on\nSo much your hugs become hold-ons\n\n[Verse 3: Little Simz]\nThe ones who tell you tell you how it really is\nThey trick you into believin' there's only one winner here\nWell, fuck it, I'm comin' first, in the condition to work\nAll I need is one mic, get you one last verse\nI've got one voice, once chance, one mother, one past\nOne pair of heels, one nose ring, one car, one goal\nWill it ever change? Who knows\nOne day, a little me, ten fingers, ten toes\nTen friends turn foes, you know how it goes\nTen songs for you, twelve days, ten shows\nBy the age of ten, I was already on a roll\nStayin' out past ten, right, and Mummy didn't know\nTen crack commandments, Biggie taught me so\nHome, but my body's still on ten different time zones\nBeen livin' in flight mode, ten seats on the plane\nHow I get here? Man, I thought I'd never see the day\nStill, it came\n\n[Verse 4: Joe Newman]\nNeon, neon, neon\nA blue neon lamp in a midnight country field\nCows surround so you lean on, lean on\nSo much your hugs become hold-ons\n\n[Bridge: Little Simz]\nSee you where I'm at, see you where I'm at\nSee\u2013see you where I'm at, right?\nSee you where I'm at, see you where I'm at\nMake a wish, cannot take it back\nFuck it, I'll relax, neon lamps\nNeon lamps (Neon lamps)\nMake a wish, cannot take it back\nCannot take it back, cannot take it back\n\n[Verse 5: Joe Newman]\nWell, that smell of sex\nGood like burning wood\nThe wayward lad laid claim\nTo two thirsty girls from Hornsea\nWho left a note when morning came\n\n[Verse 6: Little Simz]\nAlways told I'm unreadable, unbeatable\nThese days unreachable, my number's seasonal\nStill, I love you\nNiggas know my karma pays the truth from a lick of youth\nNothing I love more than being here, in and out of booths\nStill, I miss you\n\n[Outro: Ellie Rowsell]\nGirls from the pool say \"Hi\" (Girls from the pool say \"Hi\")\nThe road erodes at five feet per year\nAlong England's east coastline\n\"Was this your first time?\" (\"Was this your first time?\")\n\"Love is just a button we pressed\nLast night by the camp fire\" (\"Last night by the camp fire\")", "title": "3WW (OTG Version)", "album": "REDUXER"}], "artist": "\u200b\u200balt-J"}
