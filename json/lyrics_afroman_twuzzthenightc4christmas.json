She yelled \"Fuck you!\", and she opened the door, threw something shiny and lathery out in the six feet snow. I got out my car and I started the sneeze, then I realized it was a Raider jacket with all 3 super bowls on the sleeves. I got so happy when I pulled that new jacket out the ditch, I ran back in the house and fucked the shit outta that bitch", "title": "Twuzz the Night C4 Christmas", "album": "Santa Cuz", "image": "https://images.genius.com/42206ffc8ee2b3976d16c6df21f32bb6.640x640x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Afroman"}
