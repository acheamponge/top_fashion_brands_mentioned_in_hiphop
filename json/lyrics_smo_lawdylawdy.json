Everybody pile up\nTake it to the farm and light the bonfire up\nTailgate, keg stand, jacked up, feeling fine, [?], [?], Home grown, Cedar Pine\nSouthern downs, flock them by the truck load\nMiddle of the Hay field, ready for the mud show\nThey make the blood flow, hot in the mix\nYea a party ain't a party till you kick it in the stix\n\n[Chorus]\nOh lawdy lawdy, look who come to party, we got everybody here tonight\nAll my fellas and my ladies its gonna get a little crazy\nOn that whisky wine beer and shine\n\nOh lawdy lawdy, look who come to party, we got everybody here tonight\nAll my fellas and my ladies its gonna get a little crazy\nOn that whisky wine beer and shine"}], "artist": "SMO"}
