I can solve 'em if you're down\nSee I ain't no Brandy I come in handy when it's just a rebound\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\n[Intro]\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Intro (Extended)]", "album": "Baby Boy: Music From the Motion Picture", "year": "2001-06-19", "title": "Talk Shit 2 Ya", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b8ff5806bec69476a631e3e1d6c09a4d.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "D\u2019Angelo"}
