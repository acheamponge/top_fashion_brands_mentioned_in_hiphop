Don't think you live this life\nI could walk to Hell and back and know I'd be alright\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI told my dog to watch my back, 'cause him and I, we can't lack\nKeep it silent when I'm walking, I stop tweakin' with the flats\nAnd I just made a call to Rex, see him on FaceTime with the strap\nDown pack, racked up on 30 bands, know that\nUsain Bolt to the guap, fold flat, Hurricane Chris my fist\n\n[Bridge]\nOh yeah, hold up shawty, you know that I tweak, ayy\nBeans got me geeking, shit, I bit down on my cheek, ayy\nPulled up in that Royce like who that?
