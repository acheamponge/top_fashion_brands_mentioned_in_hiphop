Cole and Kweli\nJust before Jehovah the God crowned me the king with his goldie locket\nAlhamdulillah, we've come really far, ain't it?\nThe little engine who could, could power any car can't it?\nThe mothers in Chiraq say the murders getting burdensome\nThe cries of the despised was heard flying out of Ferguson\nThe last days and times, the holy Quran and Bible\nWe on the last page and line, the verse with all the babies dying\nOutside of the matrix, inside of the spaceship but the savior's blind\nOr so it seems, years after Noah was told he would row upstream\nThe heavens bursted and the rains came\nRetaliation for the sons of the fathers who worked the chain gangs\nI hit that shmoney dance on the coffin of a crooked cop\nIn a Worldstar society where all we do is look and watch\nNo intervention\nPolicemen beating elderly women with evil intentions on the highways and the byways\nThe police state be sprayed into the backstreet to the driveways\nOfficer friendly is an enemy now, looking at me sideways\nShit was all bad just a week ago\nThe view was just as sad just a peep ago\nThe cries of the asiatic ancient-semitic peoples\nThat propel Jay Elec from the pedestal to the steeple\n\n[Chorus: Talib Kweli & Yummy Bingham]\nTo the mothers (they neglected) to the fathers (they rejected)\nTo the sisters (disrespected) to the brothers (unprotected)\nAll of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}\nWe send this one out to\nTo the mothers (they deceited) to the fathers (they mistreated)\nTo the sisters (they misleaded) to the brothers (that get beated)\nAll of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}\nThis is happening to all of us\nTo the mothers (they neglected) to the fathers (they rejected)\nTo the sisters (disrespected) to the brothers (unprotected)\nAll of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}\nWe send this one out to\nTo the mothers (they deceited) to the fathers (they mistreated)\nTo the sisters (they misleaded) to the brothers (that get beated)\nAll of us (all of us) all of us (all of us) {all of us}\nThis is happening to all of us\n\n[Outro: Yummy Bingham]\nWe've got to live\nLive to the end (we gotta do, we do)\nWe've got to live (for our grandmothers)\nLive to the end (and granddaddies too)\nWe've got to live (live for the babies)\nLive to the end (my brothers out there going crazy)"}], "artist": "Talib Kweli"}
