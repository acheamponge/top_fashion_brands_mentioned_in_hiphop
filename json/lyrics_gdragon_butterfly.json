it\nUnintentionally, I look at the sky like\nIt reminds me of you when you smile\nNamely, how dazzling it is, ooh baby\nMy day consists of our romantic drama\nIt makes me laugh and smile, no no no\n\n[Verse 2: G-Dragon]\nI can't sleep (I try calling your name)\nI turn my head shyly (no matter what)\nI like it this much\nI rarely stop walking\n(Don't know how much I love you)\n\n[Chorus: Jin

G-Dragon]\nYo, like a butterfly\nYou look for a flower, flutter around like a child\nYour innocent eyes have a smile\nYour body moves like the sky, the sky\nYour eyes glimmer, glimmer\nI've become like this\n(You're the only one girl, one love, one life, yeah)\n\n[Chorus: Jin Jung & G-Dragon]\nEvery time I come close to you\nEvery time I'm holding you\nFeels like I'm gonna dream every time\nI get butterflies\n\n[Verse 4: G-Dragon]\nTo promise what I promised\nWe missed each other, and it makes me worry\nJust another day, it's all the same\nWhat, why is this all so complicated\nThough you can't trust guys\nLove can be forever\nWhy do you push and pull\nCan't you be a bit more honest\n\n[Verse 5: G-Dragon]\nLook at my eyes\nYou see my eyes\nYou see my lips\nListen to my heart\nIf you're listening answer me\nKiss me on the cheek\nNatural high\nMy memories\nYes my heart\nYes that'll be all I say\nIf our love continues to fill us up\nThen we'll never ever break up, trust me\nI'll make love to you\n\n[Chorus: Jin Jung & G-Dragon]\nEvery time I come close to you\nEvery time I'm feeling you\nFeels like I'm gonna dream every time\nI get butterflies\n\n[Outro: G-Dragon]\nYeah, you're special to me\nYour turn\nLa la la la la la la\nYeah my butterfly"}]}
