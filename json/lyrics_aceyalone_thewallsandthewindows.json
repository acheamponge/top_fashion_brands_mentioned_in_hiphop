{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Hook]\nThe walls have ears, the windows have eyes\nAnd a wise man tells no lies\nThe walls have ears, the windows have eyes\nAnd a dead man tells no lies\n(2x)\n\nNo lies, no lies, no lies\nAnd a dead man tells no lies\n\nIf these walls could talk\nThey would tell you things you wouldn't believe\nThese windows have seen sights you couldn't imagine\nAnd it can't be erased by Windex or a coat of paint\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 1]\nSurprise!!!\nFor each and every wall that ever stood it has a story\nSome are not so obvious and some are self-explantory\nIt's padded walls in my laboratory\nThey're lookin through the keyhole of you dormitory\nUp in my observatory, my telescope sees the glory\nBut it also sees the horror and the gory they speak derogatory\nThese walls in this hotel room, tell more tales about fat tails and head\nIt was heard but never said\nInstead the walls bleed, yeah, while they bleeding\nYou could hear the couples cheating, undercover meetings\nBehind these seedy motel walls best believe they heard it all\nWrecking balls don't bounce against the wall, to make that building fall\nThe walls outside my apartment complex, building projects are so complex\nYet they are taken all out of text\nLike the wall of Berlin, the wall of 'Nam, the wall of China\nAnd my tag on the wall as a reminder\n\n[Hook]\n\nNow of course the eyes are the true windows to the soul\nAs well as the window to the world's soul\nWhether plain glass or stained glass\nEvery set of eyes has a set of windows with a set of eyes\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow tell me what the world would be\nIf we did not have windows (We did not have windows)\nYou would hardly ever catch the criminal, or see the swindle\nEveryone inside would need A/C, when they assemble\nA private penitentiary at home, is what it might resemble\nSee, my window-pane got so much pain, the glass is busting out the frame\nSo let the candle kindle in the window, as a symbol\nI be leavin' my window open, hoping that I might get a breeze\nBut when the wind comes in the eyes\nCome in and eyes don't seem to want to leave\nBecause spying eyes by eyeing the prize, and eyeing on your movement\nYou can change your wall and windows, with some building home improvement\nBut looky looos they still be trying to look inside your window\nThe walls will hear it ever single time, your voice crescendos\nIt's enough to make you tremble, leave you in limbo\nCan it also be simple? Because these are fundamentals\nFor the mental, so don't get sentimental\nBecause these are not your windows, these wall are really rentals\nThey know everything you into, and all the business that you tend to\nSo keep your windows rolled up, and don't hold up the wall against the floor\nAnd while you're window shopping, don't bother stopping at my store\nI put a note in the window, but you couldn't read what is said\nInstead I took a rock and carved it in the glass and it read:\n\n[Hook]", "title": "The Walls and the Windows", "album": "A Book Of Human Language", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c348dfe824da4f3b04231c7e4d629ae.700x700x1.jpg", "year": "1998-04-14"}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
