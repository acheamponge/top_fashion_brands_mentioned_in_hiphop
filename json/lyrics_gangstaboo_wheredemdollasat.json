this Gangsta Boo\n\n[Hook: Gangsta Boo]\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\n\"I'm chiefin heavy understand me baby this Gangsta Boo\"\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\n\"I'm chiefin heavy understand me baby this Gangsta Boo\"\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\n\n[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]\nNow let me kick a little somethin about this lady named Boo\nHaven't you heard of the things that Miss Boo is capable to do\nGet your mind twisted like some dreads on a Jamaican's head\nVicky lingere, candles lit, rose petals on the bed\nBlazing hella weed, concentrating on what's next, be next\nBet your bottom dollar, make you holla, where them Benji's at\nComing out your pocket, don't be stoppin, what can happen baby\nHow many niggas get the chance to be in the midst of lady (never)\nNot be goin, cause my game is just too thick for that\nGangsta Boo be watchin, all the Prophet niggas got my back\nWhat you see in me, nigga roll is what I meant to be\nSippin' on Henn and grinning in your face\nTryin' to get your cheese, why you be's\nSayin' I'm doggin' you out, but still pagin' me\nNever answering the phone, cause your name be on my caller ID\nI guess you can say I'm kinda crazy in my own ways\nFuck bein' broke for days, ladies gots to get paid\n\n[Hook: Gangsta Boo]\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\n\"I'm chiefin heavy understand me baby this Gangsta Boo\"\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\n\"I'm chiefin heavy understand me baby this Gangsta Boo\"\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\n\"I'm chiefin heavy understand me baby this Gangsta Boo\"\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\n\"I'm chiefin heavy understand me baby this Gangsta Boo\"\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\n\n[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]\nIt be amazing how these bitches havin' babies by niggas\nWith no pot to piss in or no money to give her\nWhat the fuck, why you hoes wanna live that way?\nI be scheamin for some cheddar every God damn day\nNot to be the fuckin' one lookin' sad and broke\nNo nigga to fuck with, no weed to smoke\nHard times got me whinin, conversation and kickin' it\nHooked up with a little Cryst' now I'm back on my pimpin'\nThinkin' up a fuckin' plan, how to get you man\nDamn I hope you understand money came with the scam\nWe be chillin' in the cities of New York and L.A\nIt is all good, get my Conflict on, smokin' on \"Hay\"\nI hate to say, but anyway I feel you hatin' on me\nYou look into my eyes and smile but still you hatin' on me (nevermind)\nFuck it, I ain't takin' it personal, I'm about my business\nWell I have to kick it sooner or later so I ain't trippin'\n\n[Hook: Gangsta Boo]\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\n\"I'm chiefin heavy understand me baby this Gangsta Boo\"\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\n\"I'm chiefin heavy understand me baby this Gangsta Boo\"\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\n\"I'm chiefin heavy understand me baby this Gangsta Boo\"\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\n\"I'm chiefin heavy understand me baby this Gangsta Boo\"\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\n\n[Verse 3: DJ Paul]\nI keeps my shit in control, draped up in diamonds and gold\nPlayas all up in my soul while pots arranged in a row\nUp in the V-I-P seats these hoes been waitin' to see me\nI hope that bitch got my cheese, can't leave with less than a ki\nI'm scopin' out some new talent, needs some new hoes for my palace\nThe more hoes that I just grab, they hated on my like melon\nSoon as I hit the front door, they scope the gold around my collar\nI'm have to come up on loot, I can't even spare a dollar\nI got to roll gang style, bitch\n\n[Verse 4: Juicy J]\nI got a rolex on my wrist trick\nCan't you hoes get some of this\nSome niggas want to take my place\nSome hoes be beggin' ride my dick\nI can't be stopped, the Juice gon' shine\nThe droopies pokin' in my rhyme\nI'm living good and feelin' fine\nI'm high off weed, then liqour and wine\nJust roll it up, I fold it up\nThese bottle pop, pour it in my cup\nThe niggas who work from 9 to 5\nAre on the corner, post it up\nWe still can ball, the Juice and Paul\nThe deals we make, the shots we call\nEntrepeneurs on world wide tour\nThe only thing we save is cheese not brawl\n\n[Hook: Gangsta Boo]\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\n\"I'm chiefin heavy understand me baby this Gangsta Boo\"\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\n\"I'm chiefin heavy understand me baby this Gangsta Boo\"\nWhere da dollas at\nNigga, where da dollas at\n\n[Outro: DJ Paul]\nAw yeah Hypnotized Minds up in here\nYou know the business\nGangsta Boo solo tape, ya'll know the scope\nFeaturing the Tear Da Club Up Thugs, wsup, all hot\nIt's on, where the dollars at\nWhere I'm at, on the map"}]}
