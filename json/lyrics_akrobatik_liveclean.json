Yes, my name\nIs Jared, but I\u2019m not no pretender.  Nerve-bender\nEmcees who want to bring calamity: chill.  I\u2019ll bring\nThe horror like Amityville.  And, from my quill, comes\nAn arrow in the form of a rhyme to pierce your bone\nMarrow while informing your mind.  And when you\u2019re looking for\nThe culprit, it\u2019s too late.

Akrobatik\u2019s in the vicinity\nAlong with me is hip hop\u2019s holy trinity: beats, rhymes\nAnd life.  Coming to extract the trife\nAnd slice like a knife through all your rhyme cyphs\nEncasing feeble souls in bronze, experimenting on\nTheir brains to find out why they turn to pimps, hoes, and Johns\n(What?) Break their intellectual bonds and shit\nIs cool like The Fonz, bygones is bygones\nMy style swarms like Hornets, but not from Charlotte\nThe emcee is Ak\u2019, the reaction is: aww shit!\nComing with the force of fifty thousand mosh pits\nWaving my index like Mutombo when I toss shit\nLive (Live, live, live).
