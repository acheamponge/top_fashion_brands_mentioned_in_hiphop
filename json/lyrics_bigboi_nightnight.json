That, man, why is you doin' that, man?!\n\n[Verse 1: Big Boi]\nThe rhymes I design are truly unrefined\nLike diamonds with a speck of blood, dug up out the mine\nFlows flood between the ears, right behind my eyes\nGiving birth to the lines, soul search for the prize\nI takes my time when deciding what to write\nLike the SAT, while these other niggas bite\nUnderrated and mostly hated but got a lot of fight\nLike a player, play the background, fuck the spotlight\nNight, night, I recite when I step up to this mic\nReputation trunk tight, like the husband on a wife\nStay sharp as broken glass, get busted on the smash\nWhen your ass cross paths with this half of the 'Kast\n\n[Hook: B.o.B & Big Boi]\nIt's bed-time, tuck yourself at night\nCan tell that you're terrified\nCheck my record, you will see that I'm verified\nDope nigga, nobody want none (I terrorize)\nDon't nobody want none (Now you're terrified)\nNobody want none, nathan, this none (It's bedtime)\n\n[Interlude: Big Boi]\nYeah, this where the second verse supposed to go\nI don't even think I need to hit y'all with another verse\nBut I, I think I just might\nBecause I like to destroy shit\n\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nThere's no retreat and no surrender\nBeen ready for battle, General Patton's no beginner\nI keep it all Madden, I call the play then execute for the W\nLeave the rest to you, destitute, now put that money up\nOh, your conscience is nonsense\nHow you expect to get a little restitution with all this ghetto flyness?\nSnow, that's for toboggans, no, won't be no pardons\nOr bargains, three striked, then yanked up like a rod\nUh, with no apartments, and no home to run to\nYou're snitching on yourself, and now your front door, they come through\nWithout a tap on your phone\nThe only thing they had to do was listen to the raps in your songs\n\n[Bridge: Joi & Big Boi]\nLights out, the time for nighty night's long overdue\nThis is the final countdown to your swan song, you are through\nAll wack MCs and posers, this is going out to you (To you)\nThe boys will drop their jaws in awe 'cause here comes something new\nHere, here comes something new\nSomething new, something new, something new\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nStraight out the plastic, like a pack of puddings, no show\nMy nigga, you can not see me, and that's fo' show, fo' do'\nAny kind of Cadillac, I go slow\nWhen I'm smokin' on some of that choco, no low, no mid\nTop of the line pine, 'cause I blow big\nBeen 'round here for a while\nYour mama like my style, and so do your kids\nI know you love it, because a hater loves to hate\nBoy, you need me like a junkie need a razor blade and plate\nI'm dope, nigga\n\n[Hook: B.o.B & Big Boi]\nIt's bed-time, tuck yourself at night\nCan tell that you're terrified\nCheck my record, you will see that I'm verified\nDope nigga, nobody want none (I terrorize)\nDon't nobody want none (Now you're terrified)\nNobody want none, nathan, this none (It's bedtime)\n\n[Bridge: Joi & Big Boi]\nLights out, the time for nighty night's long overdue\nThis is the final countdown to your swan song, you are through\nAll wack MCs and posers, this is going out to you (To you)\nThe boys will drop their jaws in awe 'cause here comes something new\nHere, here comes something new\nSomething new, something new, something new", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d490a9246c93be0a14dc0d13699d97a2.908x908x1.jpg", "year": "2010-07-06", "title": "Night Night", "album": "Sir Lucious Left Foot...
