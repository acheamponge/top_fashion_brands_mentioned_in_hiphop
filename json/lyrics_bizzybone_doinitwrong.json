And I'm known to make the beats man\nShoot, keep bouncin like that and you gon' get a beat rash\nCocaine white, suit on and my piece match\nPlus my keys match, see I don't need ask\nYou with me now, this by far is a blessing\nWhen we get to the car you should start undressing\nYou dance the way you do waitin for someone impressing\nAnd I'm right behind you, check one-two, testing\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bizzy Bone]\nWhy they lookin sad at us, what's wrong, they should be glad for us\nWhile I'm walkin in the forest, we're gonna go a long way\nLike in the chorus, phosphorus, smoke in the mirrors\nAnd the picture's clearer, one God, always superior\nFeelin us, one time, we in the studi-udi\nGettin it groovy, 70's style like moody-oody\nRoll with a uzi, never readin how to use it\nMake my money, smokin weed and drinkin liquor, sangin music\nHey, never abuse it, the consequences are serious\nJust like my homie in Columbus, it's mysterious\nCuriosity, it's comin in so ferocious\nExpialidocious, deeper, with a psychosis - what?\nStill rockin, and we're solid as a rock, ya\nPassin that sticky-icky to Bizzy, praisin Allah\nThat's God, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit\nThe beginning of wisdom is to fear it; one time\n\n[Chorus]"}], "artist": "Bizzy Bone"}
