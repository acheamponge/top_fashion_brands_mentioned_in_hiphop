Chillin', I ain't on shit tonight\nShe gonna come through, get me right\nAnd I'ma crash through it like she ran the light\nWell, I gotta go before I miss this flight (I'm gone)\nSo I'm tryna get up (get up)\nI'm like a kid before Christmas night\nWho ain't never had none in his life, like\nThis really my life with zero exaggeration\nSome niggas just elevated, got me feelin' activated\nLost a lot in them cells and cages but held on to my dedication\nThe money got me fascinated, saw that shit and got activated\n\n[Chorus]\nSaw the money and got activated\nSaw the money and got activated\nSaw that money and got activated\nI saw that money and got activated\n\n[Verse 2]\nCanada Goose keep me warm in my cold city (Detroit)\nI got a pole with me, Glock cost 450\nYour bitch blowin' (she's drunk), took my soul with her (suck it)\nThey got they hand out (what?), I don't even know niggas\nFor testing the game? I'm testing my aim\nIf I die today, I got a M to my name\nIn 2015, ain't have a stack to my name (broke)\nCuz let me starve, sent him a pic in a new Mulsanne\nTell him I saw the money and got activated\n\n[Chorus]\nSaw the money and got activated\nSaw that money and got activated\nI saw the money and got activated\nSaw the money and got activated\nSaw the money and got activated\nI saw that money and got activated\nI saw that money and got activated"}], "artist": "Tee Grizzley"}
