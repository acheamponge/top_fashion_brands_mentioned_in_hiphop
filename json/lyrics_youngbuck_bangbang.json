The government's the drug dealers (fo' sho')\nBefore I let these police keep harassing me\nThis rookie-ass cop gon' have to blast me\nHe asked me for identification, I looked at him and laughed\nHe made a move and I heard a blast, that's what you get bitch (boom!)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Young Buck]\nIt's going down around here nigga\nGet your motherfucking head bust\nThe motherfucking street lights go out\nAnd them real niggas come out\nAll the bitch niggas go in the house\nShit is not a game man\nDon't fuck around and lose your brain\nAnd ay, all my real niggas pray\n\n[Outro]\nLord forgive me but he tried to kill me {\"Bang bang\"}\nSomebody out there gotta feel me {\"I shot you down\"}\nLord forgive me but he tried to kill me {\"Bang bang\"}\nSomebody out there gotta feel me {\"You hit the ground\"}\n\nLord forgive me but he tried to kill me {\"Bang bang\"}\nSomebody out there gotta feel me {\"I shot you down\"}\nLord forgive me but he tried to kill me {\"Bang bang\"}\nSomebody out there gotta feel me {\"That awful sound\"}", "album": "Straight Outta Ca$hville", "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/c4f8631214daf9f3357f633e0f045d6c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young Buck"}
