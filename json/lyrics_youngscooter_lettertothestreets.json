You need some hustle?\nPay attention to me\nThis a letter to the streets\nGot like ten different hustles\nEach one worth a whole lot of money\n\n[Verse 1: Young Scooter]\nI know a young nigga who lost his life\nStandin' on that corner and ain't even sold no white\nThink the streets a game, you'll play yourself\nWhite chalk, now you hood memories\nBricks cause a whole lot of murder scenes\nI promise you ain't seen all the shit I seen\nI really seen them tractor trailers willed with weed\nDone put over a million pounds on the street\nRockin' real diamonds, jugged up on this jewelry\nI done jugged up on the plug, you can't fuck with me\nI got shooters all around me, don't you fuck with me\nI push a button nigga, that's just how I order keys\nI just talked to Hector, he say he back over seas\nHe told me \"Take the year off cause we done flood the streets\"\n[?] we bust down like three mil' a piece\nI make count music, shit that put you on your feet\n\n[Chorus: Young Scooter]\nYou a hustler right?\nYou out on that corner, you out there thuggin'\nIs you livin' that street life?\nThis a letter to you, better stay on your grind\nDon't make dollars, don't make sense\nKeep that on your mind\nThis a letter to the streets\nYou out there broke? You need some hustle?\nPay attention to me\nThis a letter to the streets\nGot like ten different hustles\nEach one worth a whole lot of money\n\n[Verse 2: Young Thug]\nWhole crew get fly like planes now\nWe struggle, shit, that's why we bangin' right now\nAnd all that money, it got stains now\nAnd I'm one step ahead of you lames\nIf you play, I'll bust your brain, yeah\nUh, and I ain't crippin' nor trippin'\nI'm busy in the kitchen with them chickens, water whippin'\nI'm water whippin', yeah, and we ain't snitchin' nor crippin'\nTake your main ho to the loft\nThen call Scooter phone and drop her off\nCall that installment\nLike, oops, what I meant?\nI meant [?]\nIf I'm a dog, [?] ticks, and this cash ticks\nYour lover, I'm passed it, your ho, I smashed it\nYour ho, I trashed it, now she look nasty\nI gotta [?] my pants saggin', and baggy\nRacks on me automatic\nBut I'm ridin' in the stick with a stick\nI'll shoot a nigga whole clique and you know this\nHunnid racks on the table\nCall my homie back, he was like \"I owe this\"\nMe and my big homie Scooter ridin' 'round focused\n\n[Chorus: Young Scooter]\nYou a hustler right?\nYou out on that corner, you out there thuggin'\nIs you livin' that street life?\nThis a letter to you, better stay on your grind\nDon't make dollars, don't make sense\nKeep that on your mind\nThis a letter to the streets\nYou out there broke?
