Join the team, fight against the evil regime\nHis soul seems torn; don't know who to put on\nWell come wit us, and join wit the side of the Elohim\nWassup Ghost? I hear your soul\nI know you wanna put your hands around the devil's throat\nTwo year plan, I'll bring back the Son of Man\n[Two year plan, I'll bring back the Son of Man]\nFuck the devil and his team, blum-blum-blam\nWhere those brothers on the blocks, Google up God\nIt's God radio, so what's the ratio?\nSqueak wide spectrum, sisters I need more then ever\n[Sisters I need more then ever]\n[Sisters I need more then ever]\nIts Run DMC touger then ever\nI got more then one mac on me tucked under the leather\nHold your head, don't play into the media\nTabloids said they don't want your media\nFuck the skinny bitch, I want y'all thick\nUnless y'all skinny wit brains then who give a fuck anyways\n\nRadio was my crown of thorns, I ain't proud to put on\nTurn the volume all the way up, still didn't sound too strong\nPink hero rappers, won't be around that long\nYou just a clown for the storm\nFizzles break on the skull of crystal\nBite down to the grizzle, may I continue\nMourn to menu my mind grows like the electric shell or the UFO\nIt keeps expandin', like the hole is warmin' up the globe\nGod's house has a million stairs, twelve attics\nAnd one of them you'll find me writin' in there\nWalk out the front to the Garden of Eden\nNiggas is starvin' or eatin'\nIt's time to start robbin' and squeezin'\nGive Priest a couple of seconds\nI rebuild heaven on records\nCheck it, blow weapons at the face of the old presses\nPass us the glass, seen by the eyes of the mass\nIt took me seven days to create each line\nTook me seven hours to rehearse this rhyme\nJust seven minutes till we design\nSeven seconds to reach ya minds\nDMX in jail, holla at me dawg\n[Holla at me dawg]\nThru it all I see who you are\nReal niggas do real things\nFake niggas don't want people to see\nThey hide, fuck it, be who you was born to be\nWhy lie? Everybody wanna seem like they innocent\nYou switch sides, nigga live wit it\nReal niggas be like this is what I did\nThis is who I am, this is how I live\nMy pockets seem small but my heart and my soul feel big\nMy heart and my soul feel big"}]}
