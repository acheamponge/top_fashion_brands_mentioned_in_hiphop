M. Percival Smint]\nLadies and gentlemen uhh fellow congregation members of the church\nI welcome you here to a sad, sad day\nGive a order to God to many more happy blessed days but nevertheless we are her together to come together to put this young man to rest!\nMost people knew this here brother as an evil, rotten, decrepit, low down despicable foul mouthed monster! (Whew!)\nI realize that monsters like this do not have a place in heaven\nAnd I also realize that Hell simply will not have them because they don't want a motherfucker like this trying to take over!\nPardon my language but it must be sin\nBut we are here now through the kindness of our loving hearts to come together Today\nTo bury him into the ground with a hope and a prayer that this time he may stay dead for good!\n\n(Blaze)\nThought I told these motherfuckers you can't kill a dead man\n(dead man dead man dead man)\nWelcome to The Casket Factory"}], "artist": "Blaze Ya Dead Homie"}
