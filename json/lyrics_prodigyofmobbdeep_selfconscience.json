I told you bring the gun\n(Yeah I remember) Nah listen, without me you'd be a memory\nI'm the one you could come to for guidance\nBring you home alive when you wildin'\nKept you out of harm's way, told you when to spray\nTold you when it's time to put it away\nAnd when the cops came, you was safe\n\n[Verse 4: Prodigy]\nWithout question, I stay aware Dunn I'm listenin'\nEverytime we speak it's real, I know your intentions\nTo make sure we both safe, livin' and breathin'\nYou gets all respect from me Dunn, believe it\n\n[Verse 5: Prodigy's Conscience]\nYo we got kids to raise and bills to pay\nEnemies to lay down when they stand in our way, it's only us\n(What about the clique?) Now if you die is they comin'?\nWhen you shot do they feel the bullet?\nAnd when you broke can they fix it? Aight then, you keep writin'\nAnd let me do the thinkin', I brought us this far without mistaken\n\n[Verse 6: Nas]\nVoices in my head from choices that I dreaded choosin'\nCautions I shoulda took heed, lost in my weed, steady losin\nThug stripes, badges of honor, forces to succeed\nWhores on they knees, fuckin' with millionaires, killers and thieves\nI fuck until there's no feelin' where, I bust and I pee\nI lusted cars but I suffered and my scars run deep\nI stay to myself, one deep, pray to my God cause he\nSay when it's hard get on one knee, and ask Thy for forgiveness\nFuck the cash, the ice, the Ferraris\nWith two-twenty on the dash when your life ain't right\nSee niggas smile up in your face and stick a knife in your back\nSnakes shake your hand and got his dick up in your wife back\nWhy's it like that? It's life black and this is the game\nThe way I see it both bitches and niggas, is the same\nI trust myself, I can't fuck myself\nWhen hoes leave and no weed I still know me, just myself\nFear is weakness learn from what experience teaches\nBeware of leeches, the vampires, my secrets\nNever follow, 'cause most niggas is straight up cowards\nTake care of my body's the temple, my mind is the power", "year": "2000-11-21"}]}
