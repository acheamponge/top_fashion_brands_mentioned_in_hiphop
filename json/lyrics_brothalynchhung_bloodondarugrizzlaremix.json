rug\u2014evidence\nCould have been mine or his, so I\u2019ve been stressed out ever since\nLeft him on the concrete wit' his head split\nFound out where I live by this, by this, punk bitch\nKnowin' it\u2019s about to crack like an indo sack, I'm hella fucked up\nSo with the heat, I commence to peak out the window, waitin'\nRan off the indo, shakin\u2019 niggas like Barry Sanders \u2018cause they weak\nThey weak, hella weak, and I\u2019m at my peak\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen I'm buckin' at the enemy, it\u2019s like ten of me\nChoppin' down trees, twistin' up leaves, 'bout to make niggas bleed\nOff the hook like a fish with his lip cut, get away, got away, rip gut\nHit 'em up with enough lead stuff to turn 'em into a magnet\nBody in da dragnet, keep my Dickies saggin', blue flaggin'\nBody draggin' down the street to the end of the creek\nAnd it\u2019s evil you seekin\u2019\nCreepin\u2019 through the grass of the Gardens, dick hard\nAnd I\u2019ll be draggin' on a Garcia Vega with the green flavor neighbor-\nHood make or break a deuce-four, fuck a hoe\nA lotta niggas don\u2019t know but it\u2019s lose a hoe, gain a hoe\nSo, bruise a hoe who's to know, really doe, follow me up\nI\u2019ll leave your body in the back of the '84 Cut, all chopped up\nLook through my window at night, and you can get glass in your eye\nAfter that your ass gon\u2019 die, screamin', and that\u2019s no lie\nYou'll be passin' me by, every night until I come out with the mini Mac\nAnd attack like a pit bull off that dumb shit you pulled\nI'm talkin 'bout\u2026\n\n[Chorus]\nLeft his blood on da rug\u2014evidence\nCould have been mine or his, so I\u2019ve been stressed out ever since\nLeft him on the concrete wit' his head split\nFound out where I live by this, by this, punk bitch\nKnowin' it\u2019s about to crack like an indo sack, I'm hella fucked up\nSo with the heat, I commence to peak out the window, waitin'\nRan off the indo, shakin\u2019 niggas like Barry Sanders \u2018cause they weak\nI mean, they weak, hella weak\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know, gotta roll, like dough, blow the whole\nEastside into smithereens, leaving all the bloody streams\nYou niggas didn\u2019t give a fuck about me\nSo I left you stranded on the Titanic, don\u2019t panic\nYou just need some fuckin\u2019 heat fuckin\u2019 with me\nNigga, it\u2019s like fuckin\u2019 yo\u2019 momma\nNigga, it\u2019s right in front of your face, it\u2019s drama\nMaking your space, taking your place\nNigga, you weak, weak as fuck\nMuthafucka, duck, grab your cut\nTrying to get away from me and my AP, let me know when you had enough\nCleaning up these streets, getting rid of these hoes and foes\nYou could see me in my blue clothes, sitting on Trues and Vogues\nWaitin\u2019, see me on the street and you ain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 to say to me?\nWell, fuck you, two dicks and a four-fifth, smoke you like a bomb zip\nSuck blood from my mom\u2019s tit, that\u2019s how sick\nI got that gangsta disease\u2014I be lovin\u2019 to bring \u2018em to they knees\nMake me nut like semen\u2014seemin\u2019 like a demon\nWhen I red beam \u2018em, seen \u2018em, with the AP eatin\u2019 up human beings\n\n[Chorus]\nLeft his blood on da rug\u2014evidence\nCould have been mine or his, so I\u2019ve been stressed out ever since\nLeft him on the concrete wit' his head split\nFound out where I live by this, by this, punk bitch\nKnowin' it\u2019s about to crack like an indo sack, I'm hella fucked up\nSo with the heat, I commence to peak out the window, waitin'\nRan off the indo, shakin\u2019 niggas like Barry Sanders \u2018cause they weak\nHella\u2026hella weak\n\n[Verse 3]\nThem niggas that wanna empty out my chest plate\nI hit \u2018em with fury and make \u2018em go sickly from the snake bite\nA parasite, you ain\u2019t tight\nTry to fuck with a nigga to get right, end up in a pit bull fight\nTrust me, my trusty heat is rusty\nWaitin\u2019 for the scene to get dusty, and all you see is just me\nStanding like the last man standing, but I ain\u2019t no Bruce Willis\nManic depressive and restless, I\u2019m a hog about my juice\u2014feel it?\nWhen I plug you with the TEC, ghetto chef\nCuttin\u2019 niggas up like David Koresh, welcome to your own death\nWhen the funk was on, your nigga crept, like a spider\nDenied her of a life, then nutted all up inside her\nI kiss the bitches and made \u2018em switches, get you for all your riches\nIn your backyard I\u2019m diggin\u2019 ditches\nTend to act hard, you get your lip split\nMy weapon got the chrome dipped like Scottie Pippen\nI\u2019m dippin\u2019 from long range, hit \u2018em up, what part of the game is it?\n\n[Chorus]\nLeft his blood on da rug\u2014evidence\nCould have been mine or his, so I\u2019ve been stressed out ever since\nLeft him on the concrete wit' his head split\nFound out where I live by this, by this, punk bitch\nKnowin' it\u2019s about to crack like an indo sack, I'm hella fucked up\nSo with the heat, I commence to peak out the window, waitin'\nRan off the indo, shakin\u2019 niggas like Barry Sanders \u2018cause they weak\nHella weak, them bitches be weak, weak", "year": "2014-10-07", "album": "The
