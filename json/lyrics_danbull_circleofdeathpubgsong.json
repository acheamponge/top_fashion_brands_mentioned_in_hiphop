(oi!)\nDon't have a cow, man\nI'm sure you'll soon have it fathomed out\nSpotted the pattern now?\nBetter batten down the hatches, hell\nNo matter how, there's no backing out this battleground\nSo you might as well sit back and chill\nUntil the matter's dealt with, happy now?\nAnyway, it's too late to panic\nAnd it won't exactly help\nIf God put a hundred cards in the pack\nWhich one'll be the last he dealt?\n\n[Chorus: Roomie]\nFalling down\nWe dropped onto the ground\nInto the massive circumference of death\nThere's only one who makes it to the centre\n(Bombs over battlegrounds)\nFighting on\n(Bombs over battlegrounds)\nThe circle closes in\nAs all the bodies, they build up within\n(Dan Bull, Roomie, The Living Tombstone)\nThere's only one who makes it to the centre\n\n[Guitar Solo]", "year": "2018-03-29"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
