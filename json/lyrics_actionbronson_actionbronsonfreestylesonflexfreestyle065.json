It looks just like him\nAbout to watch the documentary that Spike did on Tyson\n\nShout outs to Tracey Morgan you inspire me, man\nI fucking love you\nBlue chips 7000, fuck that's delicious book\nWe out here, you understand me?\nQueens in this motherfucker, always\nYou understand?\n\nIn front of 50,000 screaming, higher than I've ever been\nEyes closed, mami I'm a rockstar\nNo one knows that i just woke up\nGot doped up, I just grab the mic and go nuts\nEat donuts because I'm robust\nI like to sit on  women's shoulders, Red karate outfits like i'm Sho-nuff", "title": "Action Bronson Freestyles on Flex | Freestyle #065", "album": "Funk Flex Freestyles", "image": "https://images.genius.com/245f4bc41f8d423fa59b932bdeaf60e5.719x719x1.jpg", "year": "2017-07-13"}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
