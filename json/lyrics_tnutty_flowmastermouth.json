whattt\nThat nigga said he gassed T-Nutty\nAwww man them niggas is.. awww\n\n[Chorus 1: repeat 2X]\nShould I enter the battle mode\nAnd spit like a calico weapon\nWith the definition of mic checkin\nAnd rippin it to the last second\nMy nigga, hit 'em with the flow master mouth\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow first of all, I got a verse for y'all\nAnd I'm a serve it raw, well now my nerve are calm\nFixin to switch into battle mode, and drop a bomb\nYellin Geronimo, look out for y'all\nLike troops we shoot\nLyrical bullets and poop gas, for the loot\nEvery syllable fully produced\nRap on you dudes, cause we mentally bullies\nWho thinks you could fuck wit me\nWhen I get my ass off the curb\nAnd get to rappin fast with the words\nI'm just a little bastard concerned\nSo I stall on niggas\nAnd stick to the bottom, of bottle\nTo feel my thirst, rock with me\nI'm figna to bring the knock, to the street\nLike a trunk bringin knocks, to the beats\nKnockin niggas of they feet\nWhen they walk they walk\nCause they say that talk is cheap\nI think you better watch, how you talk to me\nI come from the block, where they cock the heat\nWith a passion, lookin up to niggas that be gastin\nGivin up the neighborhood, and other niggas kiss our asses\nCause we don't give a fuck about you\nAll my buddies do the nutty kung fu\nChoppin niggas down, from the town\nWhere the kings were a crown\nGettin money, cause we love who we do\nSometimes I laugh\nCause I'm the one, that dumpin through the lynchin\nBecause of my tongue, back flippin, they trippin\nCause I got more heat, than the fifty with me\nSeekin me, rippin these niggas, with a sentence\nI'm a go nuts, when it start to get intense\nFlippin the script, steady comin with the viscous\nTy gone cut you, like barb wire fences\n\n[Chorus 2: repeat 4X]\nShould I enter the battle mode\nAnd spit like a calico weapon\nWith the definition of mic checkin\nAnd rippin it to the last second\nMy nigga, hit 'em with the flow master mouth\n\n[Verse 2]\nRecognize I got the antidote\nTo get you amped, and locced\nYou niggas rap, I hope\nYou got to practice folks, I'm like a master\nGivin up the nut factor, if you askin hoe\nFast or slow, I'm a gas the whole spot\nYou might be a hog, but you live in the pork chop\nThat I feed my dogs, ????????, and young bop\nAnd the flowheekin, named fleezo\nHot with the lyricals, cop you the minerals\nEat up the spot, like a fat boy\nInvite her to dinner bro\nEven if we shined identical\nI'm a, hit 'em with the flow, master mouth\nI'm dirty like, down south\nI murder you, when I pronounce south\nEvery verbal feud, I'm a bounce south\nGet to serve a fool, cause I refuse to lose\nCause I'm a nigga from cali, so peep game\nThrowin up the w, trouble, who wanna bang\nAs if I'm in a diskette, this some shit\nThat make niggas, flip you off\nAnd try to rip you off, sit and floss\nLike they spittin raw\nBut they never go against, the boss\nBecause I rip the bar, and if ya gettin lost\nI'm too sick for y'all\nRun up on me, and the clipse are tossed\nThen I'm dippin off\nCause I'm tryin to stay ahead, of the game\nGettin breaded, for my name\nFuckin with the, black armor\nI'm attackin harder, with the gat to harm ya\nSo watch, yo mouth\nCause I'm takin off, on you woofin\nI know that you soft, as a cushion\nYou floss, when the hoes lookin\nBut scared to go, two can come to the flow\nWhen you step into, a cold whoopin\n\n[Chorus 3: repeat 4X]\nShould I enter the battle mode\nAnd spit like a calico weapon\nWith the definition of mic checkin\nAnd rippin it to the last second\nMy nigga, hit 'em with the flow master mouth\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen its bumpin, like this\nIts hard, to stop it\nHumpin like a, hound dog\nWhen home girl, pop it\nReady to knock it\nI done shocked it\nI'm T-Nutty\nBut my buddies, call me cutty\nWith the 350, rocket\nI put my money, deep in my pocket\nAt the same tame, poppin my collar\nWhen the party is on, listen, madam\nDo you mind, double touchin the bone\nI wasn't tryin to, start trouble\nBy touchin ya thong, I'm gone\nShould I switch into, battle mode\nAnd spit, like a calico weapon\nWith the definition, of mic checkin\nAnd rippin it, to the last second\nI got 'em thinkin, of stabbin\nOr rippin, the session\nExcuse me, if I make it a mess\nBut guess what, its T-Nutty\nI'm one of the best\nAnd yes, I'm gonna confess\nLike the rest, of my people\nMy niggas, that be runnin niggas over like a diesel\nGot everybody humpin, the same way the beat go\nMakin it a gangsta party\nCause theres nobody wit us, but hoody rats and killaz\nActin silly, I'm a philly\nAccidently spill you apart\nExcuse my pardon, turn my car to garden\nTurf is deeper, than the black mans million march\nI'm perved, ready to twerk\nI'm legal with betty first\nBut I'm not stickin to the chevy with her\nCause she don't got her purse, and first of all\nI'm sippin the pommason, blowin the bomb\nI'm in the middle of the pond\nAnd can't tell the different between, a duck and swan\nHomegirl shake it on, but after the break it down\nI gotta be out, further down the road\nDrop the bomb and it might explode\nT-Nutty's nut, cuttin up\nSwitch into battle mode\n\n[Chorus 4: repeat 4X]\nShould I enter the battle mode\nAnd spit like a calico weapon\nWith the definition of mic checkin\nAnd rippin it to the last second\nMy nigga, hit 'em with the flow master mouth"}], "artist": "T-Nutty"}
