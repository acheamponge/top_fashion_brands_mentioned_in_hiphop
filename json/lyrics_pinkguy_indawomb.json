So my head is fucked up\nShe smoked a little cigarette? I got a extra thumb\nMy mama's from Chernobyl, so I got an extra head\nMy mama's from China? One child policy\nMy mama's from the ghetto, so she drinks the Hennessy\nThat results with me getting a c-section\nMy mama had protein, and I get a little bigger\nIn the 1800's you can find me in the river\nI've been dead for 2 months (x2)\n\nMy only ambition is to suck up some titties\nSo I come out the pussy all smelly and shitty\nAnd the doctor slap my ass like I'm in the club strippin'\nI'm a fetus motherfucker don't you ever be trippin'\n\nYou can find me in the womb bathing in the fluids\nIt takes you 9 months just to take a huge poo\nStarted with a pussy, now my pussy is a dick\nIt's biology, susceptible disease\nYou can find me in the cervix coming head first\nThis ain't another c-section, this is real birth\nAnd I'm a real fetus coming on this earth\nSo come give me a blanket and a hot towel\n\nYeah I listen to death metal\nBecause I'm screaming and covered in blood", "year": "2014-03-16"}]}
