Open your heart and give me a taste of your flarmp\nI'm gonna lightly stroke your flendal 'til you twarf\nThen I will gently flick your turfles, baby\n'Til you scream \"Oh my God I'm gonna quambely it so hard!\"\n\n[Interlude 1]\nDamn, that's some smooth talking\nPlenty more where that came from, UNH!\n\nNow it's-- oh, horns, sorry...\n\n[Horn Solo: Garrett Smith, Bob Reynolds & Rashawn Ross]\n\n[Interlude 2]\nHere we go baby\n\nNow it's-- oh wow, a guitar solo too, alright...\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow it's time for me to take my tiddlybits\nAnd mash 'em 'til they gub (Oh yeah!)\nI've got two nasty doodads\nAnd they're beggin' for one moment with your shnub (Yeah, yeah!)\n\n[Chorus]\nOh! My sackity pack is the figgeta-figgeta-fack\nAnd it's on the attack, lookin' to mack back in your coo\nWe're gonna mate 'til we're drained like two hot shmazins\nAnd I please you with my shmoo (Woo-hoo!)\nDinner is served and looks my vagoink is the main dish\nSo sit down and gobble my sp\u00fcnt or leave if you wish\nTo not have a nice taste of my flappy squish\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nLet her go, Ninja Brian\nShe's probably just... going to think about it\nWell, if you need me, I'll be in my chambers... schnubbing my own gank!"}], "artist": "Ninja Sex Party"}
