I look and laugh\nI dreamed a book about my friends and still can\u2019t decipher the half\nChatterbox. Now let a soothsayer major cater to a kinked breed\nBattered on the brink of disease\n(Well) I am (skin and bones), I am (sin and poems), I am (tin and chrome)\nGrin and groans, fuck it, I\u2019m tinted quinacridone\nBlow the petals off a dandelion trying to make my little gypsy blush\nAnd felt as if I\u2019d actually accomplished something\nFortify the bullies, let a joke soak in the treatment\nSit and watch the percentages teeter on the evening\nCaught a ghost up in the fuselage seconds before the cog dropped to the sticks\nAnd stared him down until he fixed it\n\nOh, fashion? It\u2019s cool and all, but what about God?\n(Oh God? well he\u2019s the man, but I mean, what about reading?)\nWhat like novels? Man, that don\u2019t hold my attention. How about television?\n(Television hurts my brain. How about walking in the rain?)\nOh I hate walking. It\u2019s boring. How about some old-fashioned gone fishin'?\n(Yeah, fishing\u2019s great, but I just hate hooking the bait. Let\u2019s dance)\nNah, I got two left feet plus motion sickness. How about breakfast?\n(Man I\u2019m hungry, but that means I'mma have to borrow some money)\nLet\u2019s fly a kite. (Let\u2019s burn the generals). Let\u2019s sell lemonade. (Let\u2019s drink)\nLet\u2019s poke a hole inside the tugboat, ease on back, and watch it sink\n(Nah, let\u2019s fail a pupil once a year at random to shake the academy)\nCasually note the blossom of phantom alignment.

Aware\nInviting, yet I\u2019m sworn to adamant manner and saddle in worn head, thorax, and abdomen\nTo primitive horseback galloping\nMy index finger\u2019s dressed in my talisman\nBranded up in the jackal skin, I spy mark of the product\nWell, one must pardon ye old common sheep detour weaving graceful through the prime directive column\nPray the virus retreats to allotted phylum\nBeanstalk with a fiend walk and my name is mud\nBut that\u2019s got a ring to it, so my soil welcomes the flood\nI walk as God\u2019s practical joke on man, practically broke\nAnd if they raise my rent again, I\u2019ll spend my nights practically soaked\nWho spit silk dimension through the noose looped by the rafters?\nAfter lack of reasoning, dead \u2018em.
