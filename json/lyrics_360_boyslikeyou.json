You're knowin' that my rep's renowned\nYour friends will tell you stay away, because I've slept around\nThat's how it works though, the word'll get around\nBack in the day it didn't phase me, yo, but lately it has kept me down\nAnd yo, I brought it on myself, but I ain't mad about it\nI kept count, but why the fuck did I brag about it?\nAnd I'll admit it though, my rep is deserved\nBut I'll be real, I wanna kill it though, 'cause havin' that rep is a curse (Yo-oh)\nMy last girl cheated on me with a close friend\nThat's two relationships, I had to watch 'em both end\nBut see, it messed with me, the two people I trusted most\nI could shrug it off on drunk'ness, but fuck 'em both\nSee, that switched somethin' inside of me\nA beast came alive in me and started just eatin' away the pride in me\nBecause we're known to make mistakes and I've grown to make a change\nI was different back then, but now I ain't the same\n\n[Chorus: Gossling]\nMy mama always told me, papa always warned me\nDon't hang around boys like you\nTeacher always told me never to be naughty\nDon't mess around with boys like you\nIf I had have listened wouldn't be in this position\nIf I had have listened wouldn't be in this position\nIf I had have listened wouldn't be in this position\nIf I had have listened wouldn't be in this position with you\n\n[Refrain 2: 360]\nAyo, I mean it, I mean it, I ain't tryna play around\nI need it, I need it, you can prob'ly see it\nYou'll prob'ly think I'm gonna rip your heart to pieces (I won't)\nGet you in the sheets (Yeah), and hit it up and leave ya ([?])\nBelieve it, believe me, you are gonna say\nMy reputation precedes me, but you gotta be fair\nThough you might'a heard about the numbers that I sleep with\nYeah, that might be true, but it's you I wanna be with\n\n[Chorus: Gossling]\nMy mama always told me, papa always warned me\nDon't hang around boys like you\nTeacher always told me never to be naughty\nDon't mess around with boys like you\nIf I had have listened wouldn't be in this position\nIf I had have listened wouldn't be in this position\nIf I had have listened wouldn't be in this position\nIf I had have listened wouldn't be in this position with you"}]}
