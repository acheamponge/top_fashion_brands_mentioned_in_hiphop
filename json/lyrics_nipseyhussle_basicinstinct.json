Don't offend me\n\n[Verse 2: G Perico]\nYeah, look\nLate night, niggas out on 109th deep\nChoppers out 'case a nigga tryna come creep\nBitch tripping cause I'm always in the street\nBag of money in a Beemer on the back seat\nBitch, you getting paid or you playing?\nBroke ass niggas always running round hating\nSee a unknown face, where you from? Is you banging?\nHeard your name before, you that nigga making statements, uh\nSo Way Out got gang of niggas in the cut pointing red dots\nLil' skinny ass nigga calling all shots\nThey send the snitches tryna get a nigga knocked off, ah\nFuck all cops, to a million dollar spot when I slide off\nChuck the deuce in the G when I ride off\nAll luxury shit for a young boss"}], "artist": "Nipsey Hussle"}
