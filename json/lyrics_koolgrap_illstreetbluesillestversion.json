Here comes G. Rap with another one y'all\nWe going to swing it like this...\n\nI'm right in front of my front steps thinking of a plan\nLooking like Raggedy Ann, no dough in hand kicking a can\nThinking of a plot to pull some bank in\nBecause I'm dead and stinking\nSoles on my shoes winking, t-shirt is shrinking\nSoon I see some ties and my eyes open wide quick\nWho's that with you, chick? Bill Blass my sidekick\nWhat's up, black? Give his hand a smack\nUp pulls a Cadillac, yo baby we'll be back\nJumped right on inside, not too many people saw us\nThinking about who gotta get robbed because the mob got a job for us\nThe drove us down to the sober section\nOf town where the clowns don't be paying for protection\nThe want us to send a message to Jimmy the bartender\nLend a friend the money next you're ripping off his car fenders\nHe's coming up short cause he snorts\nCoke, dope, nope, and hope he don't get caught\nHe owes some Benjamin Franklins, every last bit of em\nBut Jimmy's pockets are empty, so now we gotta get rid of him\nBut Jimmy's wife is with him and they don't want to involve her\nHopped out the back seat they gave me a revolver\nBlass, you distract him while I go and whack him\nEntered through the back side of the bar and then attacked him\nHe's screaming for his life, reaching for his wife\nShot him in the back of the head and shanked him with a knife\nAnd that goes for anybody who's gotta pay they dues\nYou lose, cause I got the Ill Street Blues\n\nChorus:\nYou lose, cause I got the Ill Street Blues (repeat 4x)\n\nSuckers I clobber, because my town is full of cops and robbers\nYou're not promised tomorrow in this Little Shop of Horrors\nSo I got to get with the business of hit quick\nMoneygrip's pocket's looking thick so I stick Slick\nHold it right here, hands in the air, I know you got the loot\nOr better yet, face down on the ground, empty your pockets troop\nHit the deck I got the Tech right on your neck\nAnd I expect to make a buck to heck with a traveller's check\nBut if a vic' tries to choke me\nI'll have to smoke him like I'm Smokey the Bear, so okie dokie\nGoodbye, or bon voyage, have a good journey\nDon't even try begging for your life, that don't concern me\nSo to the next weasel that freezes\nYour begging and your pleases only getting your closer to meeting Jesus\nYeah, I shake a schmuck just to make a buck\nThen I break a duck and if the duck gotta get bucked then I don't give a fuck\nHyper as a sniper piping niggas like a plumber\nCold vicking and sticking up the ones that run the numbers\nOr even a bigger score, the lady in the liquor store\nGo inside and kick in the door, pull her then I'm stickin her for\nMoney or your life, honey hurry and choose\nYou lose, because I got the Ill Street Blues\n\nChorus\n\nExtra extra read all about it in the papers\nThe boss tried to rape us, so we tossed him off the skyscraper\nBecause he pulled some other people to try and hit us\nGet us, but none of them did us, he must be trying to kid us\nBut that's dead, I'll thank God in the red, 'cross the bread borders\nSo nobody can short us, he fled down to headquarters\nReady to put some work in, we're not a lazy crew, we'll do a job or two\nBut yo, the man can't even stick me with some Crazy Glue\nReady to tore him even more because she saw him\nWe took out all the lookouts in the front and kicked his door in\nWhat's up snake, why'd you violate?\nBecause I'm a hossa (What's that?)\nYo, that's a pig that don't fly straight\nGetting ready to jab him, I grabbed him by the necktie\nHomie tried to get fly, and swing I gave him a decked eye\nYou know the evil that men do, hell is where the men go\nWe snatched him by his hands and feet and threw him out the window\nUp, up, and away cause I don't play, clown\nBuck, buck, buck, take that with you on the way down\nI'm hoping you got springs and wings on your shoes\nBut you lose, because I got the Ill Street Blues\n\nChorus"}]}
