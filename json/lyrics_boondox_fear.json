This a dream or a sign?\nIs there a chance that I can find my mind and rewind\nBut they paint me behind blinds and find somethin\nIt's like a game and nobody told me we we're playin\nAnd the fact that I don't know if I'm alive and sane\nAnd inside my brain only one thing remains\nThe fear of not knowing, paralyzes almost everthing\nAny second can be my last breath\nAnd my best guess is nothin' with no memories left\nI'm sorry\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/880085d49aff9217e77dc1187f030306.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
