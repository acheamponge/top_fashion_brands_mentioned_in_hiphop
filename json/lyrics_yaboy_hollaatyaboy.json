I ain't the same as you losers\nI dun seen it all from guns this tall ta bodies getting dumped\nNiggas slumped on the wall from crack in the sack\nAnd them cracks in the walls to hopping out spending 50 racks in the mall\nYeaa holla at ya boy baby... I'm not like them\n22 Black coupe black rim... ice grin... ice neck... ice wrist\nLooking for a nice bitch\nWhip cost a 100 grand the trip is priceless\n\nI got work everywhere\nHomie tell me what you need\nI got people down south that'll let it go for cheap\nI got people up top with a plug on the biz\nI got people in the bay\nNigga tell me what it is\nYou ain't gotta shop around\nHa holla at ya boy... (ha) holla at ya boy... (ha) holla at ya boy\nYou ain't gotta shop around\nHa holla at ya boy... (ha) holla at ya boy... (ha) holla at ya boy\n\nIf he rep that bay why his swag that way?\nMan the bar so fresh plus I'm cool like DRE\nYo my sound so new... like it's still in the wrapper\nThe rumors so true, yes I'm killin these rappers\nHeaded down south with a car full of clappers\nInside my trunk all white like pampers\nGet it off quickly... headed back swiftly\nHeard them boys on me but they'll never get me... no\nWho the truth mama let them know\nThat I keep two nines like Gretzy tho\nThe young nigga with the Pesci flow\nThat's good fella... catch me in the hood fella... get it understood fella\n\nAy you want it I got it\nYou need it come holla\nI got er'ything covered from the top to the bottom\nEverything come hot from the shots to the dollars\nI got my Miami niggas rockin in they impalas\nI got my Atlanta niggas trappin clockin they dollas\nI got my New York niggas goin hard they wildin\nEven the Midwest boys hold it down they ridin\nI got killaz up in Cali, ya'll don't want no problems\nYou ain't gotta make a move just holla at me\nMama do what you do just holla at me\nHe got a mouth full of jewels tell me who could it be?\nWho they want, who they came to see?...
