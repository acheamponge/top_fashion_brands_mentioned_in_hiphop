Home for the holidays, frankincense\nAnd haze for the fam\nNot quite back in the days, trying to keep the brother ways\nNiggas on the lamb\nCrime pays and takes back with the other hand\nHe got smoked, goddamn\nI\u2019d seen this brother still with butters\nPushing a land, eating Fudd ruckus, getting\nFat.  Big rims where he move\nGot a big gat.  Dime broads, small\nWaist, big rack, got it like that\nTold me how a couple cats got kidnapped\nDuck-taped and electrocuted \u2018til they\nGave up the stacks, getting straight jacked\nGary got deported and he ain\u2019t coming back\n\n[Hook: billy woods]\nSo if you see me pushing, that\u2019s my moms\nAnd if you see me with the dug, that\u2019s the bomb\nAnd if you see me around, I ain\u2019t\nStaying long.  Y\u2019all stay strong\n\n[Verse 2: billy woods]\nGot love from old co\u2019.  I ain\u2019t gonna\nLie\u2014a lot of niggas I used to fuck with though\nCan\u2019t fuck with no mo\u2019\nDown here, they get jelly over dro, feel me\nYo?  We all po\nGliding in the Caddy with Maggie, pass\nSpots where I used to cop baggies\nA lot of peoples doing badly and got\nThat swing.  Life straight\nClipped their wings.  Old cus-\n-tees paging for that thing\nNah, man.  I\u2019m on vacation\nThis ain\u2019t the old days, Ziplocs in\nThe basement, a nigga really trying to be\nPatient\n\n[Hook: billy woods]\nSo if you see me\nPushing, that\u2019s my moms\nAnd if you see me with the dug, that\u2019s the bomb\nBut if you see me \u2018round here\nI ain\u2019t staying long\nY\u2019all stay strong\n\n[Verse 3: billy woods]\nDropped by to see Shelly.  Homegirl got a full\nBelly\u2014like she ain\u2019t got mouths to feed already\nWhat can you say?  Once they\u2019re here\nIt\u2019s to stay.  Show \u2018em love anyway and just\nPray.  For what it\u2019s worth, it\u2019s still love\nIn every birth, but I can\u2019t lie.  Shelly\nLooking cursed, work her fingers to the bone\nSo them kids grow up alone.  Baby\nFather done \u2018em wrong, slapped her in front\nThe kids, and that\u2019s my nigga, you dig?\nSomething real bad in the air\nLike gunpowder.  To all\nMy peoples under God towers\nAll the motherfuckers getting six dollars\nAn hour, I\u2019m going to meet the man\nJanuary flowers\n\n[Hook: billy woods]\nSo if you see me pushing\nThat\u2019s my moms, and if you see me with weight\nThat\u2019s on the arm, and if\nYou see me with a gun, you know what went wrong\nY\u2019all stay strong"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
