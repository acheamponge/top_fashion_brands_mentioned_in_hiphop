Kills]\nYou should write a song where the concept is\u2026\nYou\u2019re basically writing like a love letter, or like a piece of advice\nTo your mother, when she was your age\n\n[Bridge: Angel Haze]\nI don\u2019t know\nMaybe I would write you a happy ending\nI would rearrange the pieces to your sad beginning\nI would put you far away from the decaying roots that bore you\nAnd let you experience all the ways that happiness could bloom before you\nOr maybe I\u2019m na\u00efve\u2026\nMaybe I\u2019m just a kid who thought that if she could plant a seed\nIt would somehow grow inside you\n\n[Verse 1: Angel Haze]\nSpent so much of my time wishing you were different\nBut reality is that with life can't never be provision\nBut if I could wish for one thing, I\u2019d go back and I\u2019d fix it\nI\u2019d tackle all your obstacles and kill 'em with precision\nAnd better the intentions of every single person\nWho'd play a part in you learning exactly what your worth is\nI\u2019d shower you with purpose, I\u2019d wipe hate off the surface\nI\u2019d reshape all your pain and make it fucking worth it\nNo more feeling worthless, no more fucking searching\nNo more of that fraud shit, nobody else could hurt you\nYeah, said nobody else could hurt you\nAnd if they ever tried too I\u2019d wipe 'em from the Earth too\nCuz I know that you hurting baby, I know that you tired too\nI know that you been running from everything that\u2019s behind you\nI know you\u2019ve been burying everything deep inside you\nI can see it killing you, wish that I could revive you\nBut I\u2019m stuck sitting in this time frame\nStruggling with my demons and playing these stupid mind game\nOne day it could get better, maybe it could get better\nMaybe we could change shit, no more inclement weather\nKnow you hated your mom, know it went through your mind\nYou were just like me, wish that you had more time\nTo see life from a different angle, wrestle with a different angel\nWouldn\u2019t lose your wings and fall from heaven like a cliffhanger\n\n[Verse 2: Angel Haze]\nEverything is different now, nothing is the same\nAnd nowadays I swear it feels like you don\u2019t know my name\nBut I look at the mirror and I see you every day\nI\u2019m you in every way, every hue and every shade\nAnd maybe you should know, it\u2019s the last thing that I wanted\nCuz what I hate about you makes me feel like I\u2019m haunted\nAnd I don\u2019t wanna spend the rest of my time on the run and-\nSo I\u2019m just gonna confront it, yeah I\u2019m just gonna confront it\nAnd tell you that I love you for everything you made me\nAnd that you need to hear this even if it makes you angry\nGod lives inside you, you\u2019ve already found him\nThe Devil lives in memories and you just let him hound you\nAnd I despise your church for every fucking thing they taught you\nIt\u2019s just a fucking stain that I wish I could wipe off you\nThat I wish I could wipe off you\nAnd I forgive you for doing everything that it cost you\nEverything that it cost you\nFame is such a heavy price, I wish it didn\u2019t cost you\nLosing a part of me that would follow you to Hell\nFollow you to hatred, or follow you to jail\nFollowed you to patterns that I could never get out of\nNow I realize that I could never make it with that love\nNow I realize that shit is the alternative outcome\nNever wanted you to save me, I just wish I count some\nI just wish that you grew up with someone you could count on\nI wish you knew that you could never make it without love\nFor your goddamn self, and that you never ever find it in anybody else\nCuz I would help you find you\nAnd if I saw it killing you I swear I would revive you\nAnd if that meant the end of me\nI\u2019d do it all for you so you could have your happy end in peace\n\n[Bridge 2: Natalia Kills]\nBecause, you are such a special thing\nYou\u2019re not just my mom, but you\u2019re the reason I exist\nAnd the best life that you could\u2019ve had for yourself without making a mistake\nWould have meant I woulda had a nicer childhood\nAnd even though my childhood wasn\u2019t perfect and I still love you\nI just want you to know that if I could go back and do one thing for you\nOr be one person for you\nI would make sure, not just for my sake, but so that you could\u2019ve had a nicer life\nAnd a nicer childhood, that you know\nYou would not have made the mistakes that put us all in this bad situation\nAnd not have the strength to leave\nBut just so that you would have been happier and stronger\nEven if I didn\u2019t exist, even it meant that I was never born\nThat\u2019s what I would have wanted for you\n\n[Verse 3: Angel Haze]\nYeah, and if that meant the end of me\nI\u2019d do it all for you so you could have your happy ending\nCuz I know that you hurting baby, I know that you tired too\nI know you\u2019ve been running from everything that\u2019s behind you\nI know that you\u2019ve been burying everything deep inside you\nI can see it killing you, wish that I could revive you\nAnd if that meant the end of me\nI\u2019d do it all for you so you could have your happy ending\nAnd if that meant the end of me\nI\u2019d do it all for you so you could have your happy ending\nAnd if that meant the end of me\nI\u2019d do it all for you so you could have your happy ending\n\n[Outro: Angel Haze]\nI don\u2019t know\nMaybe I would write you a happy ending\nI would rearrange the pieces to your sad beginning\nI would put you far away from the decaying roots that bore you\nAnd let you experience all the ways that happiness could bloom before you\nOr maybe I\u2019m na\u00efve\u2026\nMaybe I\u2019m just a kid who thought that if she could plant a seed\nIt would somehow grow inside you\nAnd that I could hide you from the rain\nSo that it could be easier for happiness to find you\nOr maybe I\u2019m still a kid who\u2019s caught in a dream\nI\u2019m the heir to the throne of a princess who\u2019s still trying to be queen\nOr maybe we\u2019re all just caught in the winds of a massacre\nThe blackened leaves of dying, black dahlias", "year": "2013-12-30"}]}
