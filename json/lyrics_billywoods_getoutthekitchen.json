Priviledge - \u201cGet Out the Kitchen\u201d\n[Emcee(s): billy woods and Priviledge]\n[Producer(s): 007 (AKA Bond)]\n\n[Verse 1: billy woods]\nPlay your position or get the fuck out the kitchen\nTake what\u2019s yours or keep wishing.  My mama\u2019ll\nTell you I don\u2019t listen.  In addition, there\u2019s\nA price for admission.  I got pot but not\nTo piss in, and if you shut up, might hear the gas\nHissing.  I\u2019m already dead like a Pale-\n-stinian on a mission.  After image seared\nIn the retina like faded graffiti, cooking pies\nBaked off CD, cut you where it\u2019s meaty\nIt\u2019s what for dinner, my crew mad greedy\nSaut\u00e9 my forte, BK all day\nWhere I get it my way\n\n[Verse 2: Priviledge]\nPriviledge rip this, Mike Myers surveys\nSpit these ridiculous flows, ripping clothes of\nThe same emcee in half.  When he steps up\nTo bat, every day, it\u2019s the same old thing: just\nSome false and fronting motherfuckers everywhere I look around\nThey\u2019re one and the same, so I touch \u2018em down\nWith this lyrical diction, spit a hype ren-\n-dition of a mic collision with tight wisdom.  Yo, the\nLight glistens like the calm of a storm, but it\u2019s\nType crimson.  Time shift us, and technicians\nCouldn\u2019t keep track of how I trek through dimensions\nDid I mention spitting venomous prose, yelling in tones scarcely\nAudible?  Sometimes, it\u2019s barely when the volume go\nBut always problematic if you hear me right across from you\nWhispering the kiss of death, spitting nothing less until\nThese bitches coming out of dresses, ask for Priviledge backstage\nI got game, trying to mack like back in the day\nWhere female [?] washed my troubles away just\nLike Semmi and Akeem when they Came to America\nIn search of a queen.  I\u2019m clinging by a feather on\nThe wings of a dream.  Dissention, it seems, are in\nThe ranks.  You\u2019re getting benched on your team without no thanks.  Like\nA trembling fiend, spend his last on crank.  Telling\nThese niggas that cats\u2019ll come and push that shank while\nYou\u2019re not looking.  Not a Spike Lee joint but still Crooklyn\nThese city blocks that we\u2019re stuck in, we\u2019re running, we\u2019re\nFucking, do drugs and act tough in like\nIt\u2019s nothing.  This is life, cousin.  This is my mic and\nI love it, so I\u2019m not fronting.  Strife coming, so we\nStay blunted, Olde-E-guzzling on the block \u2018til\nThe cops tried to stop some, had me down.  \u201cDuke\nI got none [?] nuggets, you won\u2019t find one of \u2018em\u201d\nI\u2019m holding tons, son.  Fuck a shakedown\nThese badge-wearing gangsters don\u2019t fool me, they hold guns\nLike Nino Brown to a nigga back like he was\nA lecherous servant.  Is that protecting and serving?  All\nI see \u2018em doo is spreading cheeks like sexual perverts, and\nThe cats who deserve it skate daily, leaving crews\nSplit up, niggas trying to get their corner back like Champ Bailey\nI just want to smoke L\u2019s fat as Hank Fraley\nAnd spit flows deeper than the SEALs in the Navy\nAnd if I make ten cent, it\u2019s all gravy \u2018cause\nI do it for the love of the game.  Trust me, dawg\nThe struggle\u2019s the aim, it\u2019s all a hustle, we all one and the same"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
