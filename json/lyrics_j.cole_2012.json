Cole]\nYes, straight out the Ville and I'm blessed\nNever met death, well, at least not yet\nOff to the place where they rest under flowers\nNiggas get wetter, like sex in the shower\nDear Lord, what am I here for?\nIs it the hoes? Or the money? Or is there more?\nI know the world is going to come to an ending\nBefore it does can finish up my sinning?\nI see the devil grinning, as if he was winning\nThis is the bottom of the ninth inning\nI'm coming back like light skinned\nWhat a sad sight, looking at my gas light\nLike \"Damn man, I just threw 10 in\"\nLook five dollars won't get you what it use too\nAnd look, love don't mean what it use too\nAnd everybody and their mommas on youtube\nIs it just me, or is this unusual?\nDon't wanna loose ya', just wanna reach ya'll\nSo let me slow down, to the beat ya'll\nPut the remote down, move your feet dawg\nOne time for the niggas holding heat ya'll\nKeep that tucked, 'fore somebody get hurt\nSee me, I rather cut catch her body give birth\nIf you were the last nigga walking on earth\nTurn yourself and clap your hands like this was church\n\n[Hook: J. Cole]\nTrust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer\nMy nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners\nBut in the meantime, homie do what you like\n(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!\nTrust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer\nMy baby hope you ready, me and you both goners\nBut in the meantime, shawty do what you like\n\n[Verse 2: J. Cole]\nI say money make the girls go down\nThey say money make the world go 'round\nSo my broke niggas, ain't it a shame\nIf Bill Gates made it rain\nThen world goin' drown\nCan I get a dollar?\nShawty got a low Impala\nMade that ass drop, hydrola', holla!\nKnow she got a man, and I don't understand\nWhy he don't grab that bitch by the collar\nFollow, look uh\nI need my women a little hood\nLiving in a world where bad means good\nThat explains why the bad hoes attract 'em\nThat explains why the bad rappers go platinum\nOr gold these days, go DJ\nIf the world stops spinning like a old DJ\nKeep playing, I need a little more time\nPre paying, just a few more dimes\nWe slaying, keep praying, hoping\n2012? You gotta be joking!\nAin't enough time and a nigga trynna' sign\nBut +The Whole World+ done lost they minds\nLook, bombs over Baghdad, bullets in the Ville\nThis is not a test, this is not a drill\nThis is all real so before we all kill\nLet me get one more feel. Baby!\n\n[Hook]\nTrust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer\nMy nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners\nBut in the meantime, homie do what you like\n(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!\nTrust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer\nMy baby hope you ready, me and you both goners\nBut in the meantime, shawty do what you like\n\n[Lil Cole]\nYeah, hey\nDuck motherfuckers, run for your lives motherfucker\nIt's Lil Cole nigga. hahaha\nThe world is coming to an end nigga (It's coming to an end motherfucker, haha)\nIt's coming to an end trust me\nI see it all revelation motherfuckers, all that shit\nIt's Lil Cole, you know I'm going in straight in to heaven nigga, holla at me\n\n[Bridge x2]\nEarthquakes and tsunamis and hurricanes\nYou meaner than Katrina baby I gotta know your name\nBefore this thing is over this might be the last song\nFor the man upstairs put the lights on and shut this party down\n\n[Hook]\nTrust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer\nMy nigga hope you ready, me and you both goners\nBut in the meantime, homie do what you like\n(Just, just) do what you like (Just, just) Hey!\nTrust the world ain't spinning for to-much longer\nMy baby hope you ready, me and you both goners\nBut in the meantime, shawty do what you like"}], "artist": "J.
