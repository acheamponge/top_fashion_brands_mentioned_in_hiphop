Don coda really hot!\nMe! I\u2019ve got a kind of cold heart\nShawty still bowling\nWe ain't rolling\nRoll some Change in my cart we ain't holding\nWe ain't folding we are sold in\nWe are out of the house\nIt\u2019s too much cold inside\nYou see that thing bright\nThat our ring light\nScary looking down because us at much height\nWe going to fight because we are fighters\nMay see us running but we not hiders\nWe burn it to the ground we lighters\nDoubles! Sorry Missed Me because it\u2019s My Turn\nThey\u2019ll maybe burn you again and again\nHey I think in this lane I\u2019ve been playing Baby\n\n[Hook]\nUh!

And Attention this is violence\nHey Man Don\u2019t you see this band is dying\nSorry we couldn\u2019t save it a tick of silence\nHomie Lean on me\nTrust is love you\u2019ve shown me\nWithout you I\u2019m feeling lonely\nNobody\u2019s there you are the only\nI rap about the winning map\nRap about the fastest lap\nLapping and I\u2019m happy\nAnd I\u2019m happy because I\u2019m rapping\nTapping phone calls\nMy knees have faced fall\nI liked baseball\nNow, Attention I hate halls\n\n[Hook]\nUh!
