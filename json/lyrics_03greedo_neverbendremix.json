Greedo]\nYeah\nYou lil' bitch ass niggas steady speaking up on the low\nIf these project walls could talk\nThey'd be just like 03, you dig?\n03\n\n[Chorus: 03 Greedo]\nIf these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard\nIn this game play your cards right or get left to starve\nMy mama made me a star, I just had it too hard\nBitch, I came from the tar but I got high again\nI'm thanking God, could have died in the pen'\nYou haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been\nYou haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]\nI couldn't stop the Xan' before I had money\nBut I been dressin' like this way before they fuckin' loved me\nFeel it in my stomach, molly might just make me vomit\nTakin' acid with the shrooms, I'm tryna see my conscience\nToo much hype in my life\nYou not with the gang so I'm not tryna hear no tides\nI'm not tryna hear no sides\nI can't believe you out here in these streets livin' lies\nYou really think that you tough\nCallin' his bluff but we really be loadin' them nines\nThey DM'ed me at 8:05\nPut it on me, had that boy gone like 8:59 (On me)\nYou can feel it in your spine\nEverybody pointin' at you 'cause you are not right\nWe gonna take ten of yours if you ever try take one of mines\nWasn't for me, then you would've been died\nIf them walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard\nThey said crack kills but my boys sellin' hard\nThey say last bitch test the work went to Mars\nShe suck my dick for ten bucks with no arms\nThat was back when times was hard\nThat was back before I had these millions that I earned\nWet up your block with a leg and an arm\nWith that burner, we aim at your head and start perms\nKeep that shit one hundred, boy, you keep it twenty\nWe just caught an opp, we thought that shit was funny\nFunny part about it, we knew we was gon' catch him one day\nAnd on the ground, he all up shakin', holdin' on his stomach\nMan, fuck all them looks\nI had to go get that bread so I could put money on them books\nThat boy look shook every time that he look\nBut I ain't gotta touch him 'cause karma's a douche\nMy dreads done got long, this shit just was a bush\nI got a boy from the block that's a cook\nHe whipped up some salmon, taste better than it look\nHe cookin' dogfood, the type that make you woof\nYou try to take this shit, I'll get you tooked\nThese niggas snitchin', they tryna write a book\nNinety thousand dollars, that's just for one of my hooks\nPlease do not compare me to none of these crooks\n\n[Chorus: 03 Greedo]\nIf these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard\nIn this game play your cards right or get left to starve\nMy mama made me a star, I just had it too hard\nBitch, I came from the tar but I got high again\nI'm thanking God, could have died in the pen\nYou haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been\nYou haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend\n\n[Verse 2: 03 Greedo]\nNiggas act like I ain't make the beat to this and \"Crimey\"\n\"Like A Nigga,\" \"Sweet Lady,\" \"Picc A Side,\" and \"Slidin'\"\n\"Murder Music,\" \"Makin' Plays,\" \"Shittin' Lately,\" \"Molly\"\nLegend over night, bitch, I got songs with everybody\nYou need help from anybody, you still ain't caught a body\nNiggas said they made me pop but scared to come and get it poppin'\nMy whole life a livin' hell, bitch, just come and homicide me\nAll this time I got of missin' friends to fuckin' traumatize me\nI don't need no man opinion, not to qualify me\nYou be spendin' money on your wrist from what the law providin'\nNowadays snitches hangin' out like, \"Nigga, why we hidin'?\"\nFloatin' 'cross these motherfuckin' hits, just had an out of body\nGod Level, nigga, I bailed out in '16\nGreedy rep 03, Uzi rep 16\nPlatinum albums from a cell, ain't no walkie-talkie\nPushin' button, playin' possum\nHold on, hold up, cops is watchin'\n\n[Chorus: 03 Greedo]\nIf these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard\nIn this game play your cards right or get left to starve\nMy mama made me a star, I just had it too hard\nBitch, I came from the tar but I got high again\nI'm thanking God, could have died in the pen\nYou haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been\nYou haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend\nIf these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard\nIn this game play your cards right or get left to starve\nMy mama made me a star, I just had it too hard\nBitch, I came from the tar but I got high again\nI'm thanking God, could have died in the pen\nYou haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been\nYou haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend\n\n[Outro: 03 Greedo]\nAnd we do it for Lil Money\nYeah, long live Lil Money\nOh, money changes everything\nI can never give a bitch a wedding ring\nOoh, yeah\nRest in peace to all my niggas\nGIP to all my killers, woo"}], "artist": "03 Greedo"}
