But my album came out and I don\u2019t know if Blue ever heard any of my music prior to this album - she\u2019s only 18 months old and I don\u2019t play my music around the house. But this album was new, so we played it. And she loves all the songs,\" he says.\n\nContinuing, Jay Z adds: \"She plays a song and she goes, 'More, Daddy, more. Daddy song.' She\u2019s my biggest fan. If no one bought 'Magna Carta', the fact that she loves it so much, it gives me the greatest joy. And that\u2019s not like a clich\u00e9. I\u2019m really serious. Just to see her \u2013 'Daddy song, more, Daddy.' She\u2019s genuine, she\u2019s honest, because she doesn\u2019t know it makes me happy. She just wants to hear it.\"", "title": "Jay Z Explains Why He Trademarked His Daughter\u2019s Name", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bf0f68ee56f29c8542ad805c6419682b.676x676x1.jpg", "year": "2013-10-02", "album": null}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
