I doubt it\n\n[Chorus: Urban Rose]\nWe've had enough of the lies\nWe won't keep believing your disguise\nAin't no way to break through\nIf you keep believing what they tell you\nCause when you wake up in the morning and you can't even breathe\nSo much stress on your chest you just got to buckle to you knees\nOur lungs are shattered, shattered from the rage\nWe don't give a fuck, we gonna scream it anyway\n\n[Verse 3: Canibus]\nSteel cables repel downward to inner mountain\nLook around it, Sasquatch is on my next album\nThe savage looking for salvage, not talk about them, talk about us\nThere's probably only a thousand left\nLyrical Law's your only outlet\nGet out while you still can and forget about it but don't doubt it\nI water the garden, the metal growing out the ground hardens\nMy lyrics give me presidential pardon\nI serve as the Shepherd and Bro to bring a message to the globe\nThis Law is the mortar between stones\nI serve as the Shepherd and Bro to bring a message to the globe\nWe are one Soul in separated zones\nWe control our souls and the microphones\nThat control the sound waves that this Law exposes\n\n[Hook: Canibus]\n2011 introspective\nLyrical Law has eleven new merits\nEvery concept seem separate\nBut all contact is a self generated effort\n2011 introspective\nLyrical Law has eleven new merits\nEvery concept seem separate\nBut all contact is a self generated effort\nFirst lesson, check it\n2011 introspective\nLyrical Law has eleven new medics\nEvery concept seem separate\nBut all contact is a self generated effort\n2011 introspective\nLyrical Law has eleven new merits\nEvery concept seem separate\nBut all contact with a higher power is a higher message"}]}
