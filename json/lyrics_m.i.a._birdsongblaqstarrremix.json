Kelly, we can fly\nBut toucan fly together\nStaying rich like an ostrich\n\n[Hook]\nFree up my love\nFree up my love\nFree up my love\nStaying rich like an ostrich\n\n[Bridge]\nNow watch the sky\nIs that a crow on a crane?\nIs that you or a plane?\nWhere's your chicken at?\nI'm watching like a hawk\nI need more birds!\nGully like a seagull\nGully like a seagull\nI'm coo-coo for you let's talk!\n\n[Hook]\nFree up my love\nFree up my love\nFree up my love\nFree up my love\nStaying rich like an ostrich", "year": "2016-08-12", "album": "AIM", "title": "Bird Song (Blaqstarr Remix)"}], "artist": "M.I.A."}
