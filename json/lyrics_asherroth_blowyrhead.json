Flacco getting tackled by fat dude\nWho grabbed [?] on a back road in bath robe with a bad cold\nHomie, I'm that cold\nAsh, I just walk around with an afro\nAnd a gavel and I laugh more than a jackal\nCrack up, pistachio\nGraduate, forget to flip that tassel\nMy bad yo, that's too much of a hassle\nCasserole with Castro\nStash gets blown like it's a gastro, you gassed though\nMore like watching grass grow\nI can be an asshole\nI rather just hang out in my castle, blast Outkast\nYo Elroy, where's Astro?\nBet if the Jetsons had a best friend from Def Jam\nAnd Geffen and wed them, I would be the best man\nGet it? I'm a breast man\nStick my face right between that chest and\nMotorboat those cocos you know it though\nDon't no one wan' go toe-to-toe\u2026. rototiller\u2026 photos off your motorola phone are terrible\nTerrible, Terridome, territory, Tara Reid\nDude from 90210, tornado made of hammer domes\nSharin' poems here, smell my pheromones\nYeah yo, my hair's long\nI don't even care homes\nTakes these earphones, put them on your eardrums\nHere's some of this red rum, you ready boy, here it comes\nYou ready boy, here it comes\n\n[Verse 2]\nOn a full ride to Florida State, too high played it safe\nCould've been Flo Rida, my bad, my mistake\nShould've started Footloose, the new Kevin Bac'\nThe way I play chicken in busses with no brakes\nAnd Busta was on break, taking a pay cut\nI play cuts from my stuff, make everybody go nuts\nNow everybody say \"Whaaaat?\"\n\n[Outro]\nWhat was that? That was fun\nLet's do that again", "year": "2015-02-18"}]}
