Once they no longer care they're extremely dangerous\n\n[Verse 2]\nStand at attention, make sure you keep your piece clean\nWhen I release steam, police crime scenes to guillotines\nHit and decapitate the bird case, featherweight\nCritical thinking, while you add water to concentrate\nXzibit crash the gate, heavyweight, box 'em in\nSeal off the exits, then cut off your Oxygen\nXzibit run with a regiment of veterans\nI only like to come out late night, like Dave Letterman\nTime for some medicine, cause niggas bout to get sick\nCalling me a hater cause I don't ride dicks\nRead my lips, we got problems like Bloods and Crips\nLove the sound of clips when I load my shit\nChamber Music, this is for the ones with stone-face\nThat catch you at the right time in the wrong place\nWe unsafe, One-fifty-one with no chase and no ice\nTake away your life like three strikes\nYeah, come on, Chamber Music\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo now Xzibit got a little money, I think it's funny\nHow motherfuckers think I'm supposed to share like Sonny\nClarify, you don't work you don't eat, I repeat\nYou don't eat you get weak, catch a fragile physique\nAccomplish more in one day than you can do in a week\nThe X-Man, Wolverine, one swing to make the cut clean\nEnd of all things manifested in flesh\nFuck the game, I take the test, graduate, pass to the S-Class\nCatch a roadrash, all you smell is hash\nChronic mix, bumping the Liks\nAddicting like a Heron fix\nBear-arm from here to a hundred-twenty meters\nGet black-balled, modern day Lee Harvey Oswald\nThe assassin, brother who came blastin'\nTake it without askin', rappers is all fashion\nXzibit keep mashing through\nGot any lost words? I got two\nTry \"fuck\" and \"you\", like that"}], "artist": "Xzibit"}
