I have-I have the unfortunate responsibility to let everyone know that Owen Hart has died. Owen Hart has tragically died from that accident here tonight\n\n[Verse 2: Wifisfuneral]\nI'll call the plug when I need it\nI'll call the plug when I'm fiending\nReflection of pain at its finest\nI'm slowly dying with no hesitation\nNever the time to say goodbye\nThen I'll roll through like Razor Ramon\nGold chains swinging\nLeave the bad guy alone\nI'm toting pistols with Al Capone\nSky falls, cold weather\nDeath to all, pour a 4 in that 24\nI'm swinging low, straight 32s\nWith that Dutch roller\nBlunt ash on my undergarments\nI'll walk on water\nThat precious such, see I would bother\nOwen Hart, them bodies fallin'", "image": "https://images.genius.com/383319eb93e791b4922afe255b44c047.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "wifisfuneral - EP", "title": "PlayStation 2"}]}
