Now come on.  Now come on.  Now let\u2019s do it\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nDo it right (Right).  Left to right (Right)\nKeep it hype (Hype) all night (Night)\nMake it happen (Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Live your life)\nMake it happen (Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Live your life)\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nDon\u2019t talk about it\u2014be it.  Get it if you see it\nWhether drunk or sober or immensely weeded, believe this\nFrom the floor to the door, go for yours\u2014don\u2019t be retreating\nMeaning, \u201cGet the fuck up!\u201d  Even if you take a beating\nFor the life I\u2019m leading, I could get a felony, cuz\nI don\u2019t like Bills like Hilary or Bellamy\nSwitched like Medina in Philly with a cheesesteak\nMy rollerblades cost one dollar\u2014I\u2019m a cheapskate\nMake it happen, captain.  This is Musical Chairs\nThe beat stop, son, and now your spot ain\u2019t there\nYour plan failed.  What\u2019s worse?  You failed your plan\nAll you did was talk about it to the next man and\nI hustle, get big muscles without going to jail\nGet success.  Nobody loves you when you fail\nYou want to get felt?  Become braille, balance the scales\nLife\u2019s a track.  Spark the action, be the third rail\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nDo it right (Right).  Left to right (Right)\nKeep it hype (Hype) all night (Night)\nMake it happen (Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Live your life)\nMake it happen (Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Live your life)\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nI\u2019m always at the right club at the right time\nKnowing the right promoters (Go left), skip the right line\nA quick pat-down.  Now I\u2019m right inside\nAnd if Pat\u2019s down, I\u2019m right on stage, ripping the rhyme\nThrow your hands in the sky, make cloud disappear\nWhether your Timbs are scuffed or there\u2019s blings in your ear\nUh.  Live the day and you could make this your year\n\u2018Cause the time is now, the place is here\nIn the 4th Pyramid was the party\u2014(Bam!)\u2014here it is\nExplosive like science experiments\nFrom the back, shorty\u2019s bags packed like groceries\nGet them beads of sweat around my neck like rosaries\nYou ain\u2019t a thug.  You bugged off the drug\u2019s reaction\nActing like you\u2019ll get to clapping to make it happen\nJust smack, lay back like slashing in the rain\nDon\u2019t say jack unless it\u2019s their music\u2014you passing the pain\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nDo it right (Right).  Left to right (Right)\nKeep it hype (Hype) all night (Night)\nMake it happen (Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Live your life)\nMake it happen (Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Live your life)\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nI\u2019m the starving artist formerly known as\nThe brother on the block you would have to loan some cash\nI made it happen on the river of life\nMoving rapid, born ripping the mic\nFrom the old school\u2014I always skipped class\nTo plant seeds in the Earth while I played on her grass\nIt takes one to dance, two to tango\nI like fruit.  Honey fresh, look like mango\nLife is funny, but I\u2019m dead-serious when I laugh\nUnderground lines like Jersey that stay on path\nYou can\u2019t make it happen if you sit on your ass\nLife is full of traffic\u2014get past it, don\u2019t crash\nGrab the steering wheel or I\u2019ll beat your ass\nWhat you doing now, man?  Forget about your past\nMake it happen today \u2018cause it might be your last\nYou see what I\u2019m doing now\u2014you don\u2019t have to ask\n\n[Hook: C-Rayz Walz] (x2)\nDo it right (Right).  Left to right (Right)\nKeep it hype (Hype) all night (Night)\nMake it happen (Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Live your life)\nMake it happen (Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Live your life)\n\n[Outro: C-Rayz Walz]\nYeah, yeah.  (Living life).  Uh.  I feel that.  (Make it happen).  Live your life.  Make it happen.  (Live your life).  Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Yeah.  Uh huh.  Do it.  Uh huh.  Yeah.  Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Make it happen.  Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Do it.  Right, left\u2014go ahead.  Make it happen"}]}
