Cole]\n\n[Chorus: J. Cole & Kendrick Lamar]\nMe and my bitch, took a little trip\nDown to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)\nApple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, lil' sip\nTook a lil' sip, took a lil' sip\nT-T-Took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip\n\n[Verse 1: J. Cole]\nAyo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death\nWhere niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref\nThat's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest\nDo you believe that Eve had Adam in check\nAnd if so, you gotta expect\nTo sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose\nCole is the king, most definite\nMy little black book thicker than the Old Testament\nNiggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate\nSame bitch giving brains to the minister\nThe same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher\nForbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple\nSlick with words don't hate me, son\nWhat you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum\nPut a price on my head won't make me run\nTry to kill me but it can't be done\n'Cause my words gon' live forever\nYou put two and two together Cole here forever\n\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nMe and my bitch, took a little trip\nDown to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)\nApple juice falling from her lips took a little sip, little sip\n\n[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & J.
