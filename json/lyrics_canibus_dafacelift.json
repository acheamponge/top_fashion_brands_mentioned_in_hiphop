This what it take 'Bis\nA beat that'll make a nigga think an earthquake hit\nThe blue collar rapper, enigmatic, democratic\nRap-savvy fanatic that can smash any matchup\nHigh with a roach, bring wealth and goggles to my show\nMy flow glow brighter than any diamond that you know\nI walk among you, draw energy from you\nThe art of Sun-Tzu, he used to bust too\nI'm like a Shaolin monk on crunk\nHoldin himself up with his thumb on the stump\nGet a Hummer for the summer to stunt\nAnd just sit in the front, while my lungs become one with the blunt\nFuturistic old schooler, look like JFK Jr\nWhen I shoot up, Jacob the jeweler with a new cut\nCan-I-bus, I ain't got what I want yet\nHow would you expect one of the best, what\nI can't get no, grab the mic, niggas lets go\nTell me who got the best flow, end up with less dough\nOpen your vest, let your chest show\nI'mma open your chest, let your breath go\nWith a thirty-eight special\nKeep it on the low, don't let the press know\nBehind the scenes, they put me on death row and won't let go\nBrace yourself while I break the chains\nMy beats bang so hard, they erase the blame\n\n[Hook] 4x\nThis is full battle rattle, attack you\nSalute while I smash you, Can-I-Bus bus to blast you 4X\n\n[Canibus]\nThe hundred bar monster, spit without hawkin up\nSmash your whole roster, fuck what it cost ya\nFuck what it cost me, join the army\nSmoke Bob Marley, the sergent major honorably discharge me\nFrom my centimil, yeah, my hemping sense\nInspiration, why is it only worth ten percent\nAnother day in the life of Mr. Can-I-bus\nMY life too rough for me not to recognize lust\nThe soldier's back to blow a fuckin hole through rap\nI wish they'd let me out the cage and stop holding me back\nYou might say the only thing holdin me back is myself\nIt ain't hard to tell what's holdin me back is my sales\nI don't make records for girls, I spit for the pearl\nBut I'm an artist in an ignorant world, world\nWorld class athlete, trained to attack beats\nMixtape smash the streets, try to patch the leaks\nNiggas try to battle me but lose\nThey got limited views, I remember when I was primitive too\nI'd sit and talk with the inquisitive youth\nCause I be spittin the truth\nSometimes I ask 'em, what you listenin to\nLyrical fitness is the proof, let me put you in the booth\nNottz'll play the beat loop\nLet me see what you could do\nThe older advise the younger when they recognize the hunger\nI do a couple raps with the mic to get pumped up\nMonkey bar sit-ups, blood rush to my head\nI write rhymes upside down with an astronaut pen\nSpit a hot sixteen and my ten, take it up a notch, then\nLost everything when I'm locked in\nYou in the kill zone, boxed in\nTried to play jump-rope\nWith skis on and got dropped when you hopped in\nThe last Mohican, smoke you in the first season\nYou don't speak it but it's no secret\nPeep it, you light weight like rice cakes\nAnybody under twenty-one to touch the microphone is mic bait\nHungry niggas start to get tight faced, that's when the fight breaks\nA sixty second rhyme is a nice pace\nWork a nigga out 'til he spit out white paste\nTell him he could hide the bruise on his face with night shades\nYou looking for a battle, you came to the right place\nThis is Mic Club and over here I'm the mic ace\n\n[Hook] 4X"}]}
