Bruiser Bitch!\nBitch!\n\n[Verse 2: Zelooperz]\nFuck all the rumors, let my dick make a statement\nHood rat hater! Bitch catch the vapors\nNiggas jackin' off they lines, master... baiter\nLet the K's decay him, put his ass in labor\nYoung Negro, draw guns like bang\nAimed at your trachea, Transylvania\nHit you with that danger, ain't got time to hang out\nDon't pretend you don't see me foolin' on you strangers, Yee ah\nAy lets play hang man! Bitch choose a letter\nYou can't spell what I'm thinking, then you gon' die guessin'\nBitch I brought the lessons and the blessings\nShootout like old westerns, I fall hard under pressure\nI'm the coldest nigga out, I can't die now\nSkinny nigga west side flow like West Nile\nYou Niggas need a fucking rest now\nTime to lay that ass down, Chop it, Chop it down!\n\nBruiser! Oh Na Na!"}]}
