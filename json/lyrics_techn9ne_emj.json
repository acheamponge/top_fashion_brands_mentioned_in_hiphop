N9ne]\nThe sadness gets deeper, and now my body's growing weaker\nTo EMJ this is dedicated; through this, you'll never belated, bro\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nI told him, I ain't know you rap nigga, you cold blooded\nThe way he busted his flow on stage wasn't slow was it\nMy nigga was flippin', he grabbed the mic and was rippin'\nUntil some idiots was trippin' and then I heard bullets whistling\nThen I sang 'em, I just want to celebrate, he laughed\nCause said he's \"writing a song called Reno 911 straight on they ass\"\nFar as words go, it's crazy them were the last I heard\nEMJ on this emotional musical journey\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nCome ride with me, it's so sad to see, still ride with me\nSo join me, let me share with this world as I live out the dreams\nWe won't be gone for long, I promise you won't be alone\nIf you lose me, I'm writing the words of this song\nMy man Michael Jones, on this emotional musical journey\n\n(Yo, this is OG Muggs, wanna shout out to my man EMJ\nGod took you away, it was too soon man\nYou're up there with the angles looking down\nAnd watching our world right now brother\nWe love you, we miss you, we'll never forget you EMJ\nRest in peace brother)\n\n[Verse 2: Irv Da Phenom]\nThat was my nigga\nIn the bunk right across from mine\nCracking them jokes like all the time\nHoppin' on stage with him every night\nAnd why niggas\nWould ever wanna take somebody's life\nWho was living it like a shining light\nMan all the homie ever did was smile\nI still don't understand it, don't think I ever will\nWhy I couldn't have been the bitch nigga\nThat god had let get killed\nInstead he took EMJ away, it's safe to say\nI'll see your face again someday, at pearly gates\nBut I hold you in my heart until\n\n[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]\nAt times I'm like\nYo EMJ, where you been?\nI know you lookin' down on me like\n\"Here I am, Kutty!\nAnd I ain't wanting for nothin' homie\nNo, mourning do nothin' for me\nYour love is enough in store in its glory\nOr what, so pour me a drink\nWe can cheer and toast, giving thanks to why\nYou didn't lose a partner, you gained a gangsta for life\nIn your heart I exist, but through music I'm able to live\nI see the way you floss me all on your wrist\nAnd that's what's up, man\"\n\n[Hook]\n\n(On my highest day my nigga, you was there\nNow I'm on my lowest day, cause you're not here\nI miss you my nigga, love you EMJ)\n\n[Verse 4: Bernz]\nI seen a cruel bitch, met her in Reno Nevada\nShe'll have you living your dreams and take 'em all with no problem\nIn dark alley ways, where devils wait for the shootout\nAt someone who was special, I told my family about him\nI saw his first tour, he told me Tech was his hero\nAnd watched him from the crowd, to then go rock the same theaters\nStep out of bounds and rounds can fly, behind casinos\nOn the night I never gambled and still lost it all in Reno\n\n[Verse 5: Wrekonize]\nIf I only had 8 bars, to come and deliver to you in the graveyard\nI'd say god is shitty for even releasing you behind the 8-ball\nThe pain's hard, I know you got kiddies to carry your name on\nBut I'm praying for 'em, so they don't end up just singing the same song\nI'm hearing it in my sleep, I'm hearing it in the head\nThere's whispers on the beat, screaming EMJ where you been\nI promise you everyone out here shed tears, until he remembers\nHigh powered mayhem, EMJ, Mayday's 7th member\n\n[Verse 6: Stevie Stone]\nRemember like it was yesterday, show up in Reno\nOff of the bus and to off a Bourbon then we hit the Casino\nAnd then we, we did the show an we was only\nIt was all that crying and you and Rock was on that homie\nNever should have left you lonely, you took six and survived it\nTalked to you a couple days ago, still riding\nNo one never thought there was complications rising\nA blood clot inside him, EMJ died I'm like\n\n(EMJ, it's Cross-Eyed Joe man, we all fucking miss you bro)\n(EMJ, what can I say man, rest in paradise\nRest in paradise pimpin, we love you)\n\n[Verse 7: Jay Rock]\nMichael Jones, I miss you my nigga\nEMJ, still tryna cope with this\nStill can't believe that you gone and I know I gots to be strong\nRevenge is mine said the lord, so we gotta let him take control\nBut lord knows that I wanna grab the gat\nCock back and land a blow and watch heads roll\nYou was a talented man, I watched you gravitate fans\nShouted out where you been, people was all in a trance\nThen we step on stage, you'd say \"You killin 'em, Rock\"\nThen I'd say \"You killin 'em, MJ,\" then you say \"Let's put on for Watts\"\nYou strong as an ox, in the bed just laying with shots\nLaughing and jokin', meanwhile I'm going through emotions\nThen you tell me Jay Rock, you gotta keep goin' on daddio\nYour album about to drop, plus you can't be slacking bro\nYeah fo' sho' my nigga, I know this a minor set back\nBut you told me keep killin' 'em, you gon' be alright\nI'mma be back, no time bet that, then I got that phone call\nIt was bad news at its best and it hurt me\nThat I lost my friend on this emotional musical journey\n\n[Verse 8: Magnum PI]\nHold up roll up a Swisher, light up and paint a picture\nOnly if painted different, I would have been right there with you\nSo instead of cryin', I rejoice and pour out some liquor\nHenny straight or mix it with lemonade, feel like I should be ashamed\nI had to look you mama dead in the face\nShe told me everything was gon' be okay\nYou told me if anything you should be on your way home any day\nSoon as we all relaxin' the phone rang, heard her sayin'\nI'm goin' crazy, it's crazy, I'm thinkin' maybe just maybe\nI'm misunderstandin' what your lady was sayin'\nNaw-naw, you can't be serious, stop your talkin' delirious\nGot my mom on the phone, you already know where his spirit went\nSo I drink that Hen 'til there no more left, right that wrong no it don't go left\nWrite this song try not stress, gotta be strong yet fight to death\nAs far as visions go that's that was last way that I saw\nEMJ on this emotional musical journey\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
