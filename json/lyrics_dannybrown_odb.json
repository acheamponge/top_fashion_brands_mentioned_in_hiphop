No I ain\u2019t going to cash out before a little fame\nYou could get that ass mashed out, bitch I\u2019m on that cash route\nAin\u2019t looking for a rest stop\nThey talk about modelling, might say I need a head shot\nI need a dollar for everyone born out of wedlock\nTryina make the bread stop, calling up the dreadlocks\nBitch, I\u2019m 'bout my peso, hablo dinero\nAnd your bitch want me to go TP on her bung-hole\nI got these rap niggas saying \"Uncle\"\nWhile I beep-beep, pull on the hair of a Rapunzel\nThink about me and masturbate with the faucet\nBout to take the game and put that bitch up in the closet\n\n[Hook]\nBut in the end I\u2019m just a dirty old man\nWith a pill in my mouth and my dick in my hand\n\n[Verse 2]\nMind of a pervert with words I submerge\nOn the verge of O.D'in for the shit that I say\nBut who gives a fuck, I'm still gon' do this shit anyway\nA dirty nigga from Detroit at the end of the day\nSo when the night fall I be gettin' head in the alley\nBy a low down nothing 2 dollar skully\nLet her use her own rubber, bullshit trojan\nDick too big, nigga I was stuffed in\nBitch I'm David Ruffin and ruffles no stuffing\nBundles of Peruvian snow with his shirt tucked in\nLookin' at the rest of you artist like you're nothing\nKnow that I'm the shit so I don't say shit\nBut when these rappers rap, dog they don't say shit\nAnd I'm George Carlin, fucked a June in August\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2013-01-01"}], "artist": "Danny Brown"}
