Finally here\nLet me roll you up a joint while you grab us a beer, for real\nI feel like things been getting a bit weird\nAnd so I've got a bone to pick with all the music I hear\nAmongst all the marketing schemes\nI try my hardest to embark within the artist in me\nWear my heart on my sleeve, play my part on the beat\nAnd when I'm on, the other stars find it hard to compete\nBut all the jargon gets bombarded makes it harder to keep\nGoing on with what I started, feel I've fallen effete\nCause what they want is just a product, sing a song about weed\nBeing blunt or being honest doesn't sell CD's\nBut see, I've been loving titties and such\nBut there's so much I'd rather talk about than being a drunk\nSkinny dippin' with some women real thin with the bud\nIs way more interestin' to listeners, I guess it's because\n\n[Chorus: Asher Roth]\nSee that underground sound radio don't play\nSo today to be a star you've gotta look both ways\nThey want that dope shit, dope shit, dope shit\nAnd I'm here\nThey say they want that dope shit, dope shit, dope shit\nWell alright, but they want something more commercial\nWell alright\nNow see that underground sound radio don't play\nSo today to be a star you've gotta look both ways\nThey want that dope shit, dope shit dope shit\nAnd I'm here\n\nYou know the bright stars, lovely chicks\nParty scenes, all the fans and shit\nLess street talk and some politics\nAre you in touch what's happening? Alright\n[We got it for you, it's the dope shit]\nAlright, well alright, well okay\n\n[Verse 2: Asher Roth]\nIt's all nonsense\nAs long as we believe it we'll continue to be heavenly incompetent\nIts all profit\nAs long as they're controlling our thoughts they're calling the shots, it's obvious\nWith no options\nWe turn on the television but all it tells is to listen to gossip\nThey're all monsters\nConvincing you they're living under the bed or even in the closet\nBut they're in our work, in our church, in our conscience\nAnd in our schools, in our rules, in our congressmen\nConfused use god defense\nBut how soon we find out even God's with them\nMy god your god who's side you with?\nMy god's your god two sides of sin\nCommon sense, not science of rocket ship\nThat's why I dream, step to a new consciousness\nIn my dream slept with the new concept and\nSpeak through, seek truth, think positive\nDo concerts connect with an audience\nAnd tell the whole world direct that we all in this\nOur fault our fathers had started this\nTo all y'all yo we all got a part in this\nWhen it's all said and done put my heart in this\nAnd then still find time for some party shit\n\n[Chorus: Asher Roth]\nSee that underground sound radio don't play\nSo today to be a star you've gotta look both ways\nThey want that dope shit, dope shit, dope shit\nAnd I'm here\nThey say they want that dope shit, dope shit, dope shit\nWell alright, but they want something more commercial\nWell alright\nNow see that underground sound radio don't play\nSo today to be a star you've gotta look both ways\nThey want that dope shit, dope shit dope shit\nAnd I'm here\n\n[Outro: Asher Roth]\nI'm feeling pretty good right now, you know?\nJust got some shit off my chest, right\nYou know I'm all for some good music and some chillin' and some vibin' out\nI think it's only appropriate that we breaking it down\nBut right now we're here for the fabulous 1500 or Nothin'", "year": null}]}
