You just lost one\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow, don't you understand, man, universal law?\nWhat you throw out comes back to you, star\nNever underestimate those who you scar\nCause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard\nYou can't hold God's people back that long\nThe chain of Satan wasn't made that strong\nTryin' to pretend like your word is your bond\nBut until you do right, all you do will go wrong\nNow, some might mistake this just for simple song\nAnd some don't know what they have 'til it's gone\nNow, even when you're gone you can still be reborn\nAnd from the night can arrive the sweet dawn\nNow, some might listen and some might shun\nAnd some may think that they've reached perfection\nIf you look closely, you'll see what you've become\nCause you might win some, but you just lost one\n\n[Hook] (x4)\nYou might win some, but you just lost one\n\n[Bridge]\nYou might win some, but you really lost one\nYou just lost one, it's so silly, how come?\nWhen it's all done, what did you really gain from?\nWhat you done done, it's so silly, how come? You might win one\n\n[Outro]\nYo, this is the full genius\nRefugees, they're about to take you on a journey\nInto the dimensions of the Book of Basement\nThe basements were, uh...\nHey, yo, one, two, three, the crew is called Refugees\nAnd if they come for testin' rap stylin'\nStop the violence and just bring it on\nY-O, hey, yo, one, two, three, the crew is called Refugees\nAnd if they come for testin' rap stylin'\nStop the violence and just bring it on, Y-O"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
