(I'm goin out)\nI mean.. I mean, I went at got these Redbox\n(WHAT??) I mean, I-I got popcorn\n\n[Hook: Rapper Big Pooh] (Pooh + Ms. Cris)\nYou're all that I need and I'm there for you\nIf you keep it real with me then there's nothing I won't do\nI'm tryna put you on but you have no clue\nHopin this is making sense to you, I'm just sayin\nI'm tryna put you on, I'm tryna put you on\nI'm tryna put you on, I'm tryna put you on\nI'm tryna put you on but you have no clue\nHopin this is making sense to you, I'm just sayin\n\n[Verse One: Rapper Big Pooh]\nI'm thinkin we together, right? So there's really no reason\nFor you to wanna hit the streets, I'm talkin every night\nI could pick a fight, or I can sit and pout\nI'd rather us converse, and try to figure out\n\n[Ms. Cris]\nWhat you mean? I just wanna have fun\nBesides a girl young, you a bit too serious\nYou talkin like I'm in the club all curious\nCheckin other niggas while you waitin at home\nBetter learn to mean enough a little space or I'm gone\n\n[Rapper Big Pooh]\nI can tell I touched a nerve, pay attention to your tone\nI wanna be a couple, I'm really tryna trust you\nIn order for this to work, there's some changin that you must do\n\n[Ms. Cris] (Big Pooh)\nMe change? Take a look in the mirror, boo\nI know you thinkin that you're perfect (Nah, that ain't true)\nPoint is, there's some things you need to change too\nLike right now, cause it's time to cunniling', dude\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
