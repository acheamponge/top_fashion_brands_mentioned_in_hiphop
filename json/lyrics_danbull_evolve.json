Shear\nSh-sh-sh-sh, they're near\nListen, they can detect fear\nLike sizzling bacons and eggs\nWe're next on the breakfast menu, I thus\nAm sensing some ennui, 'cause\nThere's a funny running through my tummy\nAnd I really don't reckon it's appendicitis\nReady to get in a fight, thrust\nAnd break something off like a fresh baked pie crust\nTireless when I bust spineless dinos up\nWith mindless violence\nLook, I've got the minds touch\nEach type of life that I touch is a pile of dust\nYou might rise up like Lazarus\nBut you can't Hyde, I'll find you, trust\nI'm biased against a Goliath\nWiping him out like a pest or a virus\nYou'll never survive unless you're as clever as Caira\nAnd you ain't, I bet you a fiver\nMy Trapper will track you to base\nEven if it's deep as a trap track packed full of bass\nI'm cracking ahead\nCracking a Kraken in the head, he's lacking the cred\nMan, I'm back in your ends and attacking your nest, so you'll have to defend it\nMy manner and method of wrecking your plans like a Gent is actually splendid\nThat Chap's too cray, tell 2K\nPulling your cranium off like a toup\u00e9e\nKeeping up appearances\nAnd insist on pronouncing bucket as bouquet\n\nTrue say\nDon't get involved in Evolve\nIf your soul isn't wholly controlled\nTo revolve round the goal\nRipping holes into all you behold\nKeep it cold, you've been told\nSaid, don't get involved in Evolve\nIf your soul isn't wholly controlled\nTo revolve round the goal\nRipping holes into all you behold\nKeep it cold, you've been told\n\n[Outro]\nDon't say you haven't been\nBecause you obviously have", "year": "2015-02-10"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
