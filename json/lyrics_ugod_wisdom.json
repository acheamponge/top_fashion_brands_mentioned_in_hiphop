(?)\nBut you stayed the course\nYou planted your seed and I watched them grow\nI remember when you first started out\nYou told me about your plans, about your music, and what you and your friends were doing\nI didn't believe you, I didn't encourage you, or discourage you\n\n[Verse 1: U-God]\nOn a quest for the relish to feed the people I cherish\nThe good and bad I inherit\nEatin' healthy, keep the brain cells nourished to flourish\nTake it all, work hard 'til the day that I perish\nI wish I could go back in time and find my first book of rhymes\nAnd publish it 'cause death is a crime\nAnd that page that I ripped out back in '89\nWritten in red ink, damn, what a line\nIt's not easy gettin' kicked out the booth after fifteen tries then I came with the truth\nThis rhyme you digest through the RZA console\nOlympic torch flamin', ten-million sold\nNot bad for a chippa who just came home to make moms proud\nThe initial goal\nI'm on now, time to conquer the globe\n\n[Hook: U-God]\nLook mom I'm on top of the world\nLook mom I'm on top of the world\nLook mom I'm on top of the world\nLook mom I'm on top of the world\n\n[Verse 2: U-God]\nAnd to all my park killers slash villains\nMy cohorts, and caharts in front the ooh buildin' (Moms they shootin')\nGrab all your children to the .... (?) staircase, Wu stickers on the ceilin'\nLate night helping baby girl with her homework\nSittin' on kitty chairs, magic marker just won't work\nBaby Mom's face fightin' on the couch in some pink shorts\nThe sacrifice of bein' on top of this rap sport\nKiss her on the cheek, tell her I love her\nThe fortune and the fame I bring home in the fourth-quarter\nTears shed in the back of the tour bus\nStarted with nine niggas and the DJ and just us\nYou see the .... (?) is high-tailin' through Tokyo\nWhat a wild rodeo, I built my portfolio\nDante's got a new car thinkin' he's cool\nMeet the first of the Hawkins to graduate film school\nFresh blue and whites on his way to the Air Force\nMaleek's grown up and he knows I be there for him\nConsolidate my time between my life and my rhymes\nBaby girl's gonna grow up right before my eyes\nGod bless my child, time flies with a smile\nGotta cherish the moment 'til i walk her down the aisle\n\n[Hook: U-God]\nLook mom I'm on top of the world\nLook mom I'm on top of the world\nLook mom I'm on top of the world\nLook mom I'm on top of the world", "title": "Wisdom", "year": "2018-03-30", "album": "Venom"}], "artist": "U-God"}
