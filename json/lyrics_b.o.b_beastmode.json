Energy Drink shoulda been my sponsor\nBut sometimes I wonder, what is this race I run for\nI give a fuck about numbers so I do find it ironic\nThese niggas get mad at me\nTalking all sideways with they eyes glazed\nThey mad cause I\u2019m straight, what the mind sees, the eyes say\nAnd they say that I went pop and the streets say I ain't hip hop\nWell if it's not, then the shit stop", "title": "Beast Mode", "album": "No Genre", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d18ebaef113d710715491da16422feee.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
