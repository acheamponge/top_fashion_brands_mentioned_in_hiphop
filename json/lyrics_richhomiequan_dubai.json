All my rocks look like icicles, diamonds\nYou get it?\n\n[Hook]\nAll my diamonds look like water you would think I'm from Dubai\nBut all these guns I keep all on me you\u2019d think I'm from the Chi\nIt\u2019s a bird no it\u2019s a plane, no those are bullets in the sky\nI got money on your head, so boy you better be disguised\nI got money on your head, I got money on your head\nI got money on your head, like a fucking Jesus piece\nI got money on your head, I got money on your head\nI got money on your head, like a fucking Jesus piece", "title": "Dubai", "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/334dc3565e640f1df6f809a163903cad.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": null}]}
