Nine on the cut, shit is crispy\nWhat makes a man? Most y'all niggas fakin' y'all hand\nWrong shit up in you cake mix takin' your grams\nIf you a hustla do it like the hustlas do\nClientel first before you try stretchin' your stew\nBig boys play for large sums\nStack up, strategize, watch the cars come\nIt's all a game, never get caught in the fame, or short your change\nBoy is a slang for Dope, girl is Cocaine\nYou no name, knock a Ki of work in a week\nThrough word of mouth came the clout, now I'm hurtin' streets\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: AZ]\nControl all the mad money, 98 Jag money\nBrag money, the type killas wanna bag from me\nName ringin' medallion on my chain swingin'\nWe mastered, soldiers even in the rain slingin'\nTurkeys on Thanksgivin', lovin' the chips\nSeven day trips, bitches just lovin' the dip\nCan we live?
