Answer the question\nThey said I need help, give me therapy\nI cancelled this session because\nNobody knows yourself more than you\nAnd I have no explanation for the things I do\nI just hope you know I ain't the villain, God is my witness\nHim and I are the only ones that know my true intentions\nBut I could tell you once and I could tell you twice\nBut only you control the choices you make in your life\nWhether it's wrong or right, we all have a place\nDon't judge me for my flaws, but what I learn from my mistakes\nTrust nowadays, it's difficult to come by\nLie too many times, you'll eventually get your tongue tied\nAlmost everyone I know sits around getting dumb high\nWhile I sit in my room and plan a plot till the sun rise\nLove it or hate it, regardless I'mma flourish\nA rebel to the grain, the ones who follow have no courage\nThey used to put me down, until they see me shine\nNow I'm laughing when they ask me for a second of my time\nI put everything on the line until I had nothing left\nThey'll hear my voice until their very last fucking breath\nYeah until I had nothing left\nThey'll hear my voice until their very last fucking breath\n\n[Hook: Phora]\nAs the wind blows, I'm looking out my window\nWondering if life will ever show me the light\nCause all I see is footsteps in the darkness\nShadows behind me and shady people so heartless\nThe ones with no soul or remorse\nThey wanna bring me down, yeah I know but of course\nI watch my back and I take care of my kinfolk\nYeah we dying every second as the wind blows\n\nYeah I'm looking out my window\nWondering if life will ever show me the light\nCause all I see is footsteps in the darkness\nShadows behind me and shady people so heartless\nThe ones with no soul or remorse\nThey wanna bring me down, yeah I know but of course\nI watch my back and I take care of my kinfolk\nYeah we dying every second as the wind blows\nLooking out my window, show me the light", "year": null}]}
