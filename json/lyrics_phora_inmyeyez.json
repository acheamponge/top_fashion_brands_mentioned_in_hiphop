They just usin' you, man, they foolin' you, homie\nThe streets don't love us, man, they never did\nAlways so worried 'bout death that we can't ever live\nSee, the streets got you brainwashed, they fuckin' with ya head\nThat's when he looked at me and said\n\"I lost my only two brothers to the streets that I rep\nBesides, my mom is the only fam I really got left\nThe only family I ever had\nThey treated me like a son, I ain't have a dad\nSee, the streets taught me loyalty, respect, and how to live by a code\nThey never taught me no different, this is all that I know\nEven though your pops was crazy and he wasn't always there\nEven though he made mistakes, homie, that motherfucker cares\nSee, I can't say the same about mine, homie\nReally I could give two fucks if he died, homie\nAfter the way that he beat my mother, he ain't never love us\nThat motherfucker's already dead in my eyes, homie\"\nI told him, \"A real man stands up on his own\nAnd doesn't need a fuckin' gang to have his back 'cause he's grown\nI know you think nobody cares, but man, that ain't true\nYour mom's already lost two men, she can't lose you\nYou think these cats would do the same for you?\nThink they'd take the blame for you?\nThink these motherfuckers would put they family through pain for you?\nWhere is your hood at when it's all said and done?\nYou ain't pull a trigger when that bullet shot from that gun\nTakin' the blame 'cause you don't wanna snitch, dog, is you dumb?\nTakin' care of your moms makes you gangster, not where you from\nDog, is you dumb?\nTakin' care of your moms makes you gangster, not where you from\"\nHe said, \"It's kill or be killed, understand that shit\nI got accessory to murder, dawg, they planned that shit\nHow dare you come visit me and act like you better\nMotherfucker, we from the same place, I can't stand that shit\nYou always preach God, but do you really believe in Him?\nIf we all sinners, man, what the fuck do we mean to Him?\nEither He don't exist or the Devil is beatin' Him\nWhen my grandma was down, where was God when she needed Him?\nYou can go your own way, but this the life for me\nDon't call, don't visit, and don't write to me\nWe all sin, you know better than the next man\nYou ain't God, you can't tell me what's wrong or right for me\nSome people meant to win, I was meant to fail\nSome people meant for Heaven, I was meant for Hell\nSome people meant to live and be free, but not me\nBeen in this system since 7, I was meant for jail\nI guess nobody is perfect\nTell my mama, I'm sorry, but there's no way to reverse it\nI guess nobody is perfect\nTell my mama, I'm sorry, but there's no way to reverse it...\"", "year": "2017-08-18"}]}
