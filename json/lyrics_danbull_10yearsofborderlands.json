You\u2019re hardly an angel\nLeave that to the Guardian Angel\nThe key to the vault is your grail\nBetter get the pieces\nIf you falter, you fail\nYour goal is to dwell\nIn this world and inhale\nUp a whole different way of living\nUltimate sell:\nWith the screws and the nuts and the bolts and the nails\nAnd the rust and the dust and the road and the rail\nThis is Paradise Lost, and you\u2019re going to Hell\nWith eighty seven bazillion volts in your tail\nNow let me tell the revoltingest tale\nFull of mudslinging, salt, and betrayal\nHop on the carousel\nAnd keep a hold of yourself\n\u2018Cause the slower you roll\nThen the colder the trail\nOi, Patricia Tannis, can you tell us what the plan is?\nCause it\u2019s as if we cannot trust anybody on the planet\nYou\u2019re a helluva fierce woman\nHelena Pierce\nCouldn\u2019t tell if your tears\nWe\u2019re really steaming your goggles\nBut not everything is as it appears\nAs your Pandora peers\nWe should have seen you were trouble\nSee, now you\u2019ve got the Vault Key\nSeems your plan\u2019s faulty\nIt\u2019s about to be stole by the Crimson Lance\nOh Jeez\nSo who\u2019s the vermin agent\nThat\u2019s commanding them to steal?\nGot to be nominative determination\nIt\u2019s Commandant Steele\nIt\u2019s time to clap back\nSo I call up Clap Trap\nHe\u2019s like, \u201cWhat\u2019s that in the back?\u201d\nThis track slaps; it\u2019s like crack\nYou can\u2019t get enough of it\nCouple lines of filler\nDripping bars for the uff of it\nTo flourish here, got to be hard\nToughen up a bit\nBorderlands is my jam\nAnd I\u2019m loving it\nGiving no fucks\nOpen that vault up\nHold up, something\u2019s holed up\nWoah, oh fuck!\n\n[Hook 1]\nStop the clocks\nThe status quo is broken\nStop all the clocks\nPandora\u2019s Box is open\nStop the clocks\nThe status quo is broken\nStop all the clocks\nPandora\u2019s box is open\n\n[Verse 2: Borderlands 2]\nWhoops!\nYou popped the vault\u2019s cherry\nUnsettling what was all buried\nScary monsters, got to get rid of \u2018em\nWhat\u2019s left?\nA big bukkake of eridium\nReady for the clean up\nBy even badder criminals\nHow can you beat them\nYou don\u2019t even have the minerals?\nYou\u2019re dealing with the pinnacle: trust\nKilling all you little fools: minimal fuss\nHyperion, he\u2019s really running militantly tyranny\nBy getting the eridium\nBy any necessary means\nIt\u2019s Handsome Jack\nWith the rapid expansion\nGot to keep topping that financial stack\nSo let\u2019s cancel that\nTake his mansion back\nHave him living in a council flat\nNo sanctuary, nah this is our domain\nSafe space from which we dish out the pain\nCrimson raiders kill invaders\nBeen doing this thing for ages\nLike it isn\u2019t dangerous\nDidn\u2019t think our little angel traitorous\n\u2018Til the day that she betrayed us\nBase incinerated, but then Lilith saved it\n\u2018Cause it is a spaceship\nThis is just the beginning page\nGood gracious!\nWhat an outrageous play, Mr Shakespeare\nWho the heck\u2019s stepping up next to the stage?\nIt\u2019s...\nA young lady, you might have seen her\nShe\u2019s a pyromaniac, it\u2019s Tiny Tina\nAbout as far from a ballerina\nYou could find, serving up havoc\nLike supoenas\nNow we\u2019re really getting manic with the beer bellied mechanic\nAnd it\u2019s Ellie twisting spanners like Tagliatelle metallic\nAnd everybody who inhabits the planet\u2019s\nIn panicked shock\nExcept perhaps one man: that\u2019s Sir Hammerlock\nHave a look through the binoculars\nHis lens even blurrier than Oculus\nGot arms all around like an octopus\nStop popping off shots at the populace\nAnd now Moxxi\u2019s mad\nI\u2019ll have what she had\nUnless it\u2019s OxyContin\nI do not need that\nShe\u2019s a cosplay hottie: fact\nBut how\u2019s anybody going to top these hats?\nNever mind that, got to stop these prats\nSo fucking give us back that Vault Key, Jack\nBetter not wake up that Rock Creature\nFor a handsome man, you\u2019re an ugly chap\nWell imagine my shock\nFinal boss: beat that\nClich\u00e9d ending, predictable plot piece: ah!\nWait a fricking minute, look, what\u2019s this map?\nNo rest for the wicked, huh?\nCut to black\n\n[Hook 2]\nSeems time has stopped\nTock tick\nRewind the clocks\nTock tick\nT-minus nought\nTock tick\nLunar tick\nBack to the moon and back\n\n[Verse 3: Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel]\nOff to the moon and it\u2019s full of lunatics\nScavs, miners, archaeologists, and fugitives\nThe lifestyle under Dahl\u2019s rather punitive\nInclusively, like a unisex crucifix\nAnd this human intervention was the Eucharist\nMother Nature doesn\u2019t take to getting two fingers\nIn the crater, like you wouldn\u2019t lose your shit\nSo as soon as it went boom and split\nThe crackening was happening and Jack?\nHe knew to get to the tip\nThen he\u2019d have to become ruthless\nUnder the tutelage of an abusive bitch\nBut he got used to it\nGave it a new twist\nLike people who call \u201cnuclear\u201d, \u201cnucular\u201d\nSo close, yet removed from the nucleus\nNo nuclear family, youth was unhappy\nReduced him to angry\nThen dude killed his granny\nEstablished a pattern\nHe whacked off his manager\nBut not by wanking\nNo, Jack toppled Tassiter\nGrabbing his throat, he strangled the bastard\nLook, still got his trophy goatee\nHave a look!\nNow he\u2019s shacking up in Helios\nThat nobody covets so much as the Legion does\nThey capture it, Jacks\u2019 a bit miffed\nUnderstandably\nSo he sends some mercenaries into low gravity\nRamming deep down underground: cleaning cavities\nLike a gang of dentists\nSent to depravity\nYeah, he might be training up an army of robots\nBut if they\u2019re not harming you, so what?\nDon\u2019t knock!\nIt\u2019s not notable enough to remark upon\nSo shut up, lock targets on Zarpedon\nThen choose to pop open that vault\nIf you don\u2019t know Jack\nThat\u2019s your own damn fault\n\n[Hook 3]\nWatch the clock\nTick tock tick tock\nWatch the clock\nWhat time you clocking off?\nWatch the clock\nTick tock tick tock\nSleeves up, watches off\n\n[Verse 4: Tales from the Borderlands]\nRhys\u2019s peace is about to crack\nWhen he sees a key up for grabs on the black market\nI\u2019ll take that, thank you, thank you\nNow Rhys is a man bankrupt\nBad luck\nDamn, if only he\u2019d have known\nIt was bogus: a phony, a hoax\nHe\u2019d have ganged up\nWith Fiona the Chancer\nShe knows every scam ever wrote\nIn the damn book\nGoing to get, going to get\nGoing to get that money back\nBut I can\u2019t get you out of my head\nNot funny, Jack\nProgress is slower than a tortoise walks\nUntil the Gortys Core\nShowed them vaults galore\nShore to shore\nI\u2019m sure I said already but I\u2019ll say again\nSo many, there\u2019s a smorgasbord\nAwkward dork\nBut when you\u2019re hijacked by Jack\nBoth boys and girls will be behind\nLike a bike rack\nI don\u2019t want to be Handsome Jack\u2019s puppet\nSo there\u2019s only one answer; that\u2019s fuck it\nBring the whole thing down\nCrashing to the surface\nLooking back\nLife now has a bigger purpose\nCash is fracking worthless\nUnless it can be spent\nFed up of living life\nAt like seventy percent\nHope you\u2019re ready for the next episode\nOi, oi, oi, oi\nSmoke skags every day\n\n[Verse 5: Commander Lilith & The Fight for Sanctuary]\nBut wait, there's more!\nGracious lord\nWe\u2019ve awakened an ancient force\nLilith and the raiders\nHave brought the vault map\nBut Dahl have attacked\nAnd they won\u2019t pull back\nDropping gas\nWhole place getting jacked\nLike The8thHawk\nBetter get away\nAnd escape with a phasewalk\nSave Vaughn from infected bandits\nSo we can gather samples\nAnd invent the antidote\nTannis isn\u2019t at a level\nAt which she can master this\nSo Cassius asks them\nIf they\u2019ll acid trip\nTo the mountain\nBut who\u2019s that? Talon!\nMordecai\u2019s in trouble\nGet the Moonshot Cannon\nRamming into Helios\nSo get packing\nTo meet a boss we believe is from Saturn\nTake pieces of it\nYeah, pull them out of Uranus\nThe power contained within\nIt\u2019s bloody outrageous\nI guess this infection\u2019s affecting us a lot\nBeing heckled by Hector\nIs messing up the plot\nBetter stop that man while we can\nWhile we\u2019ve got a chance\nBecause his plants are buggering up our plans\nJust look at his lab\nIt\u2019s full of failed experiments\nHypothesis: What a prick, here\u2019s the evidence\nNow Cassius is overcome with nastiness\nSo perhaps the vaccine is within his ass\nIn fact it is\nLet\u2019s get extracting it\nAnd then go back to Sanctuary\nThe place stinks like an outdated pack of anchovies\nLilith goes ham, completely tearing up the place\nBorderlands need saving\nFor yet another day...", "year": "2019-06-27"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
