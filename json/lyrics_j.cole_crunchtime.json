Cole]\nTick\nThis is for my niggas in the fourth quarter\nJust watching that clock tick. Yeah\n\n[Verse 1: J. Cole]\nYou said, \"at what point do you start seeing bread?\nBeen out hustling for years, shoe box right under my bed\nI move the work out my momma\u2019s house, got me a little old crib\nI always fantasize if I had went to college instead\nWould I be happily married instead of broke and unwed?\nMy nigga made a major move I said I hope for the best\nI told my sister as I kissed her cheek I\u2019m better off dead\nFucking with this white, it\u2019s all been downhill like a sled\nNow listen, I understand they say you make your own bed\nBut tell me who supplied these sheets with this cheap ass thread\nIn denial about the feds, he can\u2019t see past bread\nNow do exactly what the man in the ski mask says, okay?\nThese are the times, survival my only crime\nI gotta be on my grind, a lot of my homies gone\nInside of me Lord I know, it\u2019s a lie that we gon' be fine\nBut momma I\u2019m tired of crying, just lie to me one more time\"\n\n[Hook]\nCause it\u2019s crunch time\nCause it\u2019s crunch time\nShit real man\nA nigga got bills man it\u2019s crunch time\n\nShit real man a nigga got bills\n\n[Verse 2: J Cole]\nLook, scavenge these records of these days MP3\u2019s\nLooking for the samples to put a nigga on MTV\u2019s\nThis is for nigga\u2019s with empty dreams and empty jeans\nStill holding on to the word maybe\nCause this 9 to 5 shit is driving you stir crazy\nComing home tired just to hear it from your lady\nHollering about your baby, need this and need that\nAnd all you want is peace and quiet\nMaybe some feedback, on these raps\nCause labels ain\u2019t hollering, and niggas ain't downloading\nNobody see your vision, they walking around blindfolded\nAll this time holding on to possibilities\nYou step outside, you smoke a blunt and then you feel the breeze\nFuck what they talking, it ain\u2019t like life come often\nOnly thing worse than death is a regret filled coffin\nSo try before you die or always wonder what if?\nI thank the lord for this wonderful gift\nLooking for strength in this crunch time\n\n[Hook]\nLooking for strength in the crunch time\nThis shit real dawg a nigga got bills dawg\nIt\u2019s crunch time, yeah nigga it\u2019s crunch time\nThis shit real dawg a nigga got bills dawg\n\n[Outro: J. Cole]\nI feel your pain nigga trust me\nFor all my nigga\u2019s out there still trying to get it\nFew nigga\u2019s I know, few nigga\u2019s I don\u2019t know\n\nShout out to my nigga FilthE\nNervous Reck\nShout out to Marcus\nMy nigga I forgive you for all that shit you said\nI understand my nigga\nStill love. Yeah"}], "artist": "J. Cole"}
