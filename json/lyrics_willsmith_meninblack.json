I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya\nWe're your first, last and only line of defense\nAgainst the worst scum of the universe\nSo don't fear us, cheer us\nIf you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're the fearless\nMiBs, freezin' up all the flack\n(What's that stand for?) Men in Black\n\n[Bridge: Will Smith (Coko)]\nUh, and\n(The Men in Black...)\nUh, and\n(The Men in Black...)\nLet me see ya just bounce it with me, just bounce with me (bounce with me...)\nJust bounce it with me c'mon\nLet me see ya just slide with me, just slide with me (slide, slide, slide, slide)\nJust slide with me c'mon\nLet me see ya take a walk with me, just walk it with me (walk with me...)\nTake a walk with me c'mon\nAnd make your neck work\nNow freeze... (uh huh huh ha...)\n\n[Chorus: Coko]\nHere come the Men in Black (Men in Black...)\nGalaxy defenders (oooh, oooh, oooh)\nHere come the Men in Black (Men in Black...)\nThey won't let you remember (no, no...)\n\n[Verse 3: Will Smith]\nAlright check it, let me tell you this in closin'\nI know we might seem imposin'\nBut trust me if we ever show in your section\nBelieve me, it's for your own protection\n'Cause we see things that you need not see\nAnd we be places that you need not be\nSo go witcha life, forget that Roswell crap\nShow love to the black suit, 'cause that's the Men in...\nThat's the Men in...\n\n[Chorus: Coko]\nHere come the Men in Black (here they come...)\nGalaxy defenders (galaxy defenders)\nHere come the Men in Black (oh, here they come...)\nThey won't let you remember (won't let you remember...)\nHere come the Men in Black (ohh, here they come...)\nGalaxy defenders (oooh, oooh, oooh)\nHere come the Men in Black\nThey won't let you remember", "image": "https://images.genius.com/6ff032c2934a9215e837b43eeed1f27f.953x953x1.jpg", "album": "Big Willie Style", "title": "Men in Black"}]}
