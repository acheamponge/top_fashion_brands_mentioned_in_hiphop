I'm trying to usher my confessions\nI never made my life public before this\nAnd I can see the publicists ready to haul this\n\n[Outro]\nThe truth heavy, that's why most can't carry her, God spoke through me and I carried her\nThe truth heavy, that's why most can't carry her, God spoke through me and I carried them\nTruth"}], "artist": "Kardinal Offishall"}
