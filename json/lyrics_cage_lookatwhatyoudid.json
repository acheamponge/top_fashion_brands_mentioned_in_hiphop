Bite me\n\nLook at what you did, you don\u2019t even see what you did\nWon\u2019t even look at yourself cause you think everyone is\nA reflection of a vampire\nSleep like a vampire\nCreep like a vampire\nSpeak like a vampire\n\nLook at what you did, you don\u2019t even see what you did\nWon\u2019t even look at yourself cause you think everyone is\nA reflection of a vampire\nSleep like a vampire\nCreep like a vampire\nFreak, you are a vampire\n\nCreature of elusiveness, nightlife exclusive fix\nTourniquets of velvet ropes, my four-finger crucifix\nI\u2019m pale with a sa-tan from Hell, groomed well\nShe tried to lift the CC pin from my lapel\nHer fingernails longer than her dress is\nShe bit into my neck, snapped my necklace\nAnd sunk her teeth into breakfast\nShe licked her lips and said, \u201cI had a really fun night.\u201d\nBefore she jumped in a cab she said, \u201cGet home before sunlight.\u201d\n\nLook at what you did, you don\u2019t even see what you did\nWon\u2019t even look at yourself cause you think everyone is\nA reflection of a vampire\nSleep like a vampire\nCreep like a vampire\nFreak, you are a vampire"}]}
