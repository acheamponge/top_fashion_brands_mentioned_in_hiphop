"[Intro]\nGod, man, there's just something I wanna talk to you about man, I...\nI know right now, I'm probably\nProbably the last nigga you wanna hear from\nYou know, man, I just want you to know, God, man\nI'm tired of lying to you\n\n[Chorus]\nGod, I want you to know I'm so tired of lying to you\nAnd I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lied to you\nSo if you stopped fucking with me right now, I understand\nBut I guess that'll leave me out here thugging on my own, then\nGod, I want you to know I'm so tired of lying to you\nAnd I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lied to you\nSo if you stopped fucking with me right now, I understand\nBut I guess that'll leave me out here thugging on my own, then\n\n[Verse 1]\nI told a motherfucker if I died today, I don't know where I'd go\n'Cause a lot of us out here that think we going to Heaven and just ain't gon' go\nAnd some of us go to church every Sunday and still ain't gon' go\nGod, I lied to you too much, that's the reason I don't know where I'm gon' go\nI remember that little hoe [?], man, I told you I wasn't gon' fuck raw no more\nI guess what I should've said is I wasn't gonna fuck her raw no more\nAnd after my homeboy got killed, I promised you I was gonna start coming to church\nBut instead of coming to church, I jumped in the game, head first\nIt seems like weddings and funerals are the only time I step foot in church\nBut if I was locked up right now, shit, you would be my best friend\n'Cause that's when niggas seem like the Lord's pointing they lives then\nMy dog locked up and every time i talk to him, God all I'm hearing\nBut like I told him, the crackers let him out tomorrow, he'd be back robbing again\nAnd I don't know why we sit down and lie to you 'bout some fuck shit\nAnd like they say, the ones that love you want a nigga to give they ass a kiss\nSo I guess that's the best way to explain me and your relationship\n\n[Chorus]\nGod, I want you to know I'm so tired of lying to you\nAnd I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lied to you\nSo if you stopped fucking with me right now, I understand\nBut I guess that'll leave me out here thugging on my own, then\nGod, I want you to know I'm so tired of lying to you\nAnd I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lied to you\nSo if you stopped fucking with me right now, I understand\nBut I guess that'll leave me out here thugging on my own, then\n\n[Verse 2]\nI told my mama, shit, God must be a pain freak\n'Cause after all these lies and broken promises, God still fuck with me\nI'ma be honest with you, God: shit, I wouldn't even fuck with me\nBut when I was on my dick, shit, you couldn't stop hearing from me\nAs soon as my money got straight, shit, you stopped hearing from me\nAnd after my brother got indicted, I promised you I was through with the dope game\nAnd as soon as them 22's came out, I got right back in the dope game\nI remember being on my knees, throwing up my insides\nThe heavy yak in my system, felt like I was 'bout to fucking die\nAnd I told you I wasn't gonna drink no more, shit, there goes another lie\nAnd I know one day, all this thugging shit gotta come to an end\nAnd I understand that one day, my life got to come to an end\n\n[Chorus]\nGod, I want you to know I'm so tired of lying to you\nAnd I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lied to you\nSo if you stopped fucking with me right now, I understand\nBut I guess that'll leave me out here thugging on my own, then\nGod, I want you to know I'm so tired of lying to you\nAnd I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lied to you\nSo if you stopped fucking with me right now, I understand\nBut I guess that'll leave me out here thugging on my own, then\n\n[Monologue]\nGod, man, there's just...\nThere's so much fucked up with me right now, man, just...\nTrying to be out here and, you know\nTrying to get money and...\nFuck with all these hoes and...\nYou know, I, I find time for everything else\nBut it seem like I don't never got no time for you\nAnd shit, my grandma always tell me, man\nI-I just need to just join somebody's church, man\nAnd, and give my life over to God, man\nAnd God, you just know, man\nJust right now, man, you better know than anybody, man\nYou just, you just know I'm full of shit\nYou know I ain't finna do right right now\nYou know, I don't know if this gonna affect, you know what I'm saying\nMe, me getting into Heaven\nBut you know, I just want you to know, man\nI'm, I'm just tired of lying to you, man\nAnd I feel like if I'ma deal with you\nI feel like I should deal with you like a real nigga\nAnd I don't know why\nYou know, I've seen the, I've seen to lose focus in that, man\nAnd, you know, shit, I know you probably feel like I'm, I'm bullshitting you right now\nBut you know, God, man, I, I, I just want you know, man\nI'm tired of lying to you, man\nAnd I just feel like if I'm gonna fuck with you\nI need to fuck with you all the way\nAnd, man, regardless of what, you know, a lot of people think, man\nMan, I, I'm trying to go to Heaven, man\nYou got to know I got a good heart, man\nGod, I just want you to know, man, I'm tired of lying to you\n\n[Chorus]\nGod, I want you to know I'm so tired of lying to you\nAnd I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lied to you\nSo if you stopped fucking with me right now, I understand\nBut I guess that'll leave me out here thugging on my own, then\nGod, I want you to know I'm so tired of lying to you\nAnd I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lied to you\nSo if you stopped fucking with me right now, I understand\nBut I guess that'll leave me out here thugging on my own, then", "year": "2005-03-01"}]}
