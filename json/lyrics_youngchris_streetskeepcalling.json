cases you know when they was kids, yahmean\nCaught em when they was kids like mufuckas change yah nahmsayin\n\n[Chorus]\nHe say the streets keep calling, police keep coming\nHe ain't tryna keep runnin' he a product of the hustle\nGotta stand for somethin', said he ain't goin' out with nothin' baby\nStreets keep calling, police keep coming\nHe ain't tryna keep runnin' he a product of the hustle\nGotta stand for somethin', said he ain't goin' out with nothin' baby\nHe gon get it, he gon hustle ya'll\nHe gon put his money out and make it double ya'll\nMake it triple make it quatro make it cinco\nDirty money under mattress when the bank close, stuck in the night life\nPromise to never let the night life in\nWhen he get out they pulled him right back in\n\n[Verse 1]\nParty and hoes out with the homies like the night never end\nJail the only time life never end\nThey gave life to my friend\nNever hold me right back at the F\nNever hold me on Rikers again\nGot him strapped down, magazine vest to the chest\nTry not to give a knife to they chin\nSendin' kites through the mic I don't write with a pen\nPrayin' you don't never spend another night in the pen\nI be the bridge to your son keep him tight with his kin\nKeep your commissary right when it's in\nYou ain't gotta ask these bitch ass niggas for nothin' they gon brush it\nThey might not give back to you they gon discuss it to these hoes and the bros when they try to look big\nAll they do is screamin' free you whole time through your bid\nPostin' pictures on the gram like 'free my man'\nWhen the last time you niggas went to see my man\nWhen the last time you put a check on his line or went around and checked on his mom\nYa'll ain't real your lying\nCounted him out when he said his goodbyes\nHe call home and you never push five\nShoulda deaded it then, it's like a real nigga never can win\nYou know the moral of the story baby never depend\n\n[Chorus]\nHe say the streets keep calling, police keep coming\nHe ain't tryna keep runnin' he a product of the hustle\nGotta stand for somethin', said he ain't goin' out with nothin' baby\nStreets keep calling, police keep coming\nHe ain't tryna keep runnin' he a product of the hustle\nGotta stand for somethin', said he ain't goin' out with nothin' baby\nHe gon get it, he gon hustle ya'll\nHe gon put his money out and make it double ya'll\nMake it triple make it quatro make it cinco\nDirty money under mattress when the bank close, stuck in the night life\nPromise to never let the night life in\nWhen he get out they pulled him right back in\nStuck in the night life\nPromise to never let the night life in\nWhen he get out they pulled him right back in\n\n[Verse 2]\nWipin' tears from my mother face\nHer youngest out on another tour, her oldest out on another case\nSomewhere out in another state\nBack and forth to court it's another wait\nWatchin' mother break down from what the judges say\nDon't trip be cool that's what my brother say\nTryna parole where his baby mother stay\nI gotta tell my neph daddy gotta stay another day\nTryna explain it to my niece in another way\nDaddy gone, he'll be home\nAll we gotta do is just pray it don't be long\nWalk the track get you wacked my nigga be strong\n\n[Chorus]\nHe say the streets keep calling, police keep coming\nHe ain't tryna keep runnin' he a product of the hustle\nGotta stand for somethin', said he ain't goin' out with nothin' baby\nStreets keep calling, police keep coming\nHe ain't tryna keep runnin' he a product of the hustle\nGotta stand for somethin', said he ain't goin' out with nothin' baby\nHe gon get it, he gon hustle ya'll\nHe gon put his money out and make it double ya'll\nMake it triple make it quatro make it cinco\nDirty money under mattress when the bank close, stuck in the night life\nPromise to never let the night life in\nWhen he get out they pulled him right back in\nPromise to never let the night life in\nWhen he get out they pulled him right back in\n\n[Verse 3]\nGot a old head that cook it the best\nWe call him OG Heff stay in the hood he's the chef\nAll the old heads respect him all the young boys love him\nAll the fiends go to him all the hoodrats fuck him\nNigga caught up in the hustle\nHe can never get out\nMight catch a little case and let it sit out\nRight back to it, once he heard they like that fluid\nHe put some water on the block added some white back to it\nAnd he got it for the low added his price back to it\nTook a loss had to fight back through it\nNow or never said he liked that music\nEvery youngn OG just caught another case and his son is [?]\n\n[Chorus]\nHe say the streets keep calling, police keep coming\nHe ain't tryna keep runnin' he a product of the hustle\nGotta stand for somethin', said he ain't goin' out with nothin' baby\nStreets keep calling, police keep coming\nHe ain't tryna keep runnin' he a product of the hustle\nGotta stand for somethin', said he ain't goin' out with nothin' baby\nHe gon get it, he gon hustle ya'll\nHe gon put his money out, and make it double ya'll\nMake it triple make it quatro make it cinco\nDirty money under mattress when the bank close, stuck in the night life\nPromise to never let the night life in\nWhen he get out they pulled him right back in\nStuck in the night life\nPromise to never let the night life in\nWhen he get out they pulled him
