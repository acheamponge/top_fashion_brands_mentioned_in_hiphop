Been there, done that, still rollin' like I'm on run flats\nMinor setback are just setups for major comebacks\nTalkin' bout the 6, boy, we built that city\nI show the real niggas love, and I got that clearly\nI'm slavin' while you was hatin' boy, we call that envy\nWant that drop can't stop 'till I cop that Bentley\nStay quiet, boy you livin' out your broke down Chevy\nGotta lightweight with me but he hold that heavy\nComin' from where its deadly and the foes ain't friendly\nHandle like A.I. and shoot like Reggie\nWho gon' check me\n\n[Outro]\nRather die than live the way you livin'\nIf we ride 'em ride, that's on my chariot\nEye for an eye and I ain't kiddin'\nPut on a suit and tie and handle business\nAnd way before Meek switched up I was the realest\nIn the city, my city still on my fitted\nI just want a m\u00e9nage with all my women\nJust wanna touch the stars with all my niggas\nAnd this could be yours, all yours, but you ain't trippin'\nThey tryna knock me off, but I ain't slippin'\nAll I know is how to get it, all we know is how to win it\nWent and copped a Porsche, and wrote this for all my niggas", "year": "2017-01-25"}]}
