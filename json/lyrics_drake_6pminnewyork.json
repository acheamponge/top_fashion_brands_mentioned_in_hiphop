It's so childish calling my name on the world stage\nYou need to act your age and not your girl's age\nIt gets worse by the annual\nMy career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man\nOh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah\nI know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em\nTo show they outfits off, guess they need the attention\nI remember when it used to be music that did it\nBut then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?\nI'm managed by my friends that I grew up with\nI'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with\nIf me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'\nWe'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on\nBut here we are, yeah\nLately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence\nThey scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments\nBitches alter my messages like we had words\nAnd stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve\nBitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing\nCrazy this year\u2014fuckin' with my image\nI've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year\nFuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year\nAnd I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot\n'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block\nNobody lookin' out for nobody\nMaybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody\nInstead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it\nAnd then they start to \"R.I.P.\" about it\nAnd four weeks later nobody even speaks about it\nDamn, I just had to say my piece about it\nOh, you gotta love it\u2014\nBut they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject\nI been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget\nI gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins\nShout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca\nJulia, Ericka, Southern America\nPart of my heritage, pardon my arrogance\nPart in my hair again, that's that comeback flow\nComeback flow, once I start it's apparent\nI'm with girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'\nBut fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement\nYour content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?\nShit is gettin' so personal in your verses too\nI wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas\nBein' number two is just being the first to lose\nMy city dictated music, nobody seein' us\nWinter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up\nBeen observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough\nLet's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup\nYeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all\nYou rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all\n\"Best I Ever Had\" seems like a decade ago\nDecadent flow and I still got a decade to go\nOh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?\nWhy you rappin' like you come from the streets?\nI got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees\nAnd I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves\nPhantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease\nI cook the beef well done on the double with cheese\nSpecial order for anybody that's comin' for me\nShit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze\nYou see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me\nCuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free\nI'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat\nFeel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats\nMan, oh, you gotta love it, yeah\nAnd on top of that it's getting harder to eat\nRappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease\nTo think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me\nAnd now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe\nBut, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh)\nYeah\nAnd head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop)\nI know your girl well, just not in public\nBlame the city, I'm a product of it\nYoung nigga from the city\nYou gotta love it\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, gotta love it\n*Laughs*\nYeah"}]}
