We are desperate.\"\n\n\"No one says the federal government is doing a good job.\"\n\n\"...and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people ...\"\n\n\"No water... yeah, and I fought for my country for years.\"\n\n\"We need help. We really need help.\"\n\n\"In Baghdad, they-they drop, they airdrop - water, food to people\nWhy can't they do that for their own people?\"\n\n\"...the same idiots can't get a bottle of water into a\nMajor American city in three days are trying to win a war\"\n\n[Verse 1: Jay-Z]\nPeople was poor before the hurricane came\nBefore the downpour poured, it was like when Mary J. sang\nEveryday it rains, so everyday the pain\nWent ignored and I'm sure ignorance was to blame\nBut life is a chain, cause and effected\nNiggas off the chain, because they affected\nIt's a dirty game, it's whatever is effective\nFrom weed to sellin' 'caine, gotta put that in effect, shit\nWouldn't you loot?
