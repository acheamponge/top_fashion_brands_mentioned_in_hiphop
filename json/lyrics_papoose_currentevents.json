What are you astronomers?\nSwallow a hollow cause you ain't promised tomorrow bro\nBloggers and bothers, Twitter following followers\nI'm cocking a chopper to pop shots like photographers\nMy third eye focusing like I watch with binoculars\nDrug money in my sneakers, foam posit depositer\nThe coppers be watching but I ain't stopping, I'm tired of ya\nMiddle finger to camera while they watching the monitors\nSmoke ganja from Florida when I roll a blunt I hold a blunt\nTo my mouth like the player hold a harmonica\nCan't stop the drama there ain't no hiding bro\nI Barack Obama/Osama Bin Laden ya\n\n[Scratch Hook]", "year": "2014-04-04"}]}
