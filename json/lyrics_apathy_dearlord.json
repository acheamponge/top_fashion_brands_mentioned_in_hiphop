How sad is that shit?\nA billion better candidates, in fact I can make a list\nHow about a rapist or a racist or a Satanist?\nDear Lord, I\u2019m fucked up in shambles\nI thought you weren\u2019t supposed to give me more than I can handle\nAnd not to blasphemous but Lord I gotta ask this\nHow you let adults fuck children in their asses\nHow you let these evil motherfuckers rule the masses\nAnd jack the lower classes until the stock crashes\nI\u2019m sick of evil getting over and me I\u2019m trying to be a better man like I\u2019m supposed to\nTrying to stay sober cause I\u2019m running out of chauffeurs\nAnd rap\u2019s my only way to sit and talk with Jehovah\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 3: Diabolic]\nDear Lord, I need you, please communicate\nAcknowledge that you hear me clearly, I\u2019ve been losing faith\nWas it Adam fucking Eve speaking to a snake\nOr did evolution through an ape create the human race?\nI need to know was it planned or do I choose my fate?\nAnd if I do I need insight on the path that you would take\nDear Lord it\u2019s hard to sit and pray\nWhen drug dealers get to live as little kids are hit with strays\nGoddamn you, I swear if I could stand in your place\nThe gunman\u2019s hammer would break and just jam in his face\nWhy are war games in your name? Is there a true religion?\nIs it Muslim, Jew, or Christian? Or is it superstition?\nI could use a vision, visit when I\u2019m dreaming\nWhat\u2019s the purpose? What\u2019s the meaning of this life I\u2019ve been leading?\nLet me know, do you even listen when I\u2019m speaking?\nAnd will you intervene when I\u2019m possessed by inner-demons?\n\n[Hook x2]", "year": null}]}
