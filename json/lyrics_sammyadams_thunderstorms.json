I'm wide awake, couple hours to go\nI guess I'm stuck rewinding what happened to us but I don't know\nGot an e-mail from my mother but I didn't read it\nThe subject was 'city of love' so I had to delete it\nI went to surf, played the game each time I was defeated\nYou got a heartbeat? Send it over I think I'mma need it\nCause mine was ripped out, didn't even flip out\nChartered the jet home and got a text saying 'missed out'\nBut really I'm the only one who didn't miss out\nA situation that handed man a heartbreak, picked out\nSay I'm living a dream? It's more like a nightmare\nStill put on a smile for the camera but man it's quite clear\nSomething that I had is a week ago, yeah was right there\nPouring out all my feelings in hopes that one of y'all might care\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy face pressed against the window pane\nFogging up the glass in the window so I could trace your name\nWatching cars on the ground switching outta lanes\nStaring over the city feeling different cause something changed\nDamn. Took off without a F or two\nAnd even though I left, felt there was something that I could do\nCould've done, too late now\nEvery single girl I take home just seems fake now\nBut it's my fault: instead of closing the curtains\nI let the show go on in search of the missing person\nAnd as I question if finding you's even worth it\nRemember kissing, touching, girl we were almost perfect\nAnd the clouds rolling in again\nRaining on the city when it clears\nThey still in my head, thunderstorms\nThunderstorm\nYeah", "album": "Into the Wild"}], "artist": "Sammy Adams"}
