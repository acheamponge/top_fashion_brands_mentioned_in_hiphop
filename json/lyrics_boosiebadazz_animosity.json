Niggas trying to steal your soul\nNigga broke in my car when I used to give em dough\nTalk about me when I pass through, smile when I stop\nSo I strap down everyday cause I can't die like 2Pac\nYou niggas want my force out my voice, I know\nYou niggas want some niggas dead in that 4. Well let's go\nMy mamma told me bout them niggas. Them niggas ain't your friends\nWho saw me stash my shit, you blood hit me again\nWe supposed to be kin. But your family hurt you too\nThat dust and that gin got me thinkin of dirt to do\nBut hatin leads to brokeness and brokeness lead to hopeless\nAnd don't think a nigga don't notice ...your animosity\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat kinda nigga call my mom and tell her her son got shot?\nA pussy nigga who need that dick up in his fot box\nI got rocks. Lotta niggas don't like that\nLike (... ?) I'll be right back. G-Nikes with my night cat\nSince starter jackets, I had haters back then\nUsed to get my name in my fade when I was 8, 9, and 10\nAnd these hoes runnin off, fuckin up my relationships\nI done had enough, don't know how much I can take this shit\nMy baby mamma people against me to the fullest\nIt's because this fit got me runnin duckin bullets\nI know you hate my twenties so I'm a get some more inches\nAnd I'm a get some Ks and have you runnin jumpin fences\nI'm lookin in the judge eyes, and he muggin me down\nBaton Rouge to red stick. There ain't no love in this town\nThey hold a grudge in this town, They catchin slugs in this town\nAnd don't think I ain't peepin you, clown", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a20a5c08a8dc2c05f970b30bd6d258c0.316x316x1.jpg"}]}
