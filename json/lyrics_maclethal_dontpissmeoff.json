major record label\nStab the A&R's hand to the table\n\n[Hook: Chamillionaire & *Mac Lethal*]\nYou see the truth is\nI lose my cool quick\nDon\u2019t make me lose it\nYou\u2019ll see what lewd is\nYou see the truth is\nI\u2019m not like you kid\nSo don\u2019t be foolish\nI just might prove it\nJust try not to piss me off\n*You should tell them not to piss me off*\n*Because I\u2019ll turn them into history y\u2019all* (Don\u2019t piss me off)\n*So please, just please don\u2019t piss me off* (Don\u2019t piss me off)\n*You should tell them not to piss me off*\n*Because I\u2019ll turn them into history y\u2019all* (Don\u2019t piss me off)\n*So please, just please don\u2019t piss me off* (Don\u2019t piss me off)\n\nChamillionaire, go\n\n[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]\nI was calm for a minute, yeah I started off calm\nTil I saw a fake rapper with an Audemars on\nThen I realized with my seeing eyes it was same man\nThat did came in with the Audemars on\nDidn\u2019t really think that we would audit y\u2019all, huh?\nCause it seemed that you really got you balling on wrong\nWhole bunch of jewelers that I oughtta call on\nJust to show them that you\u2019re faker than Mardi Gras charm\nCan\u2019t stand y\u2019all, I\u2019m loving every thought of y\u2019all gone\nI can read the future like it\u2019s written on your palm\nOne hand on my cellie while I\u2019m calling your mom\nGot your sis strip teasing in a falling off thong\nPick them up, take them with me in the car to your prom\nThey know my money longer than a Ramadan song\nBut I ain\u2019t trying to hit\nI\u2019m just trying to hit your face on your car while you got your car alarm on\nSee how many rappers I can get to retire\nIf you spit, I\u2019m just hoping that you slip on saliva\nTurn a Coke can with a kickstand to a time bomb\nGive it to you then I disappear like McGyver\nThere will be no survivors\nThere will be no reminders\nGot a cannon but I bet you never seeing Mariah\nGive a second and I bet you\u2019re going to see them on fire\nWhen you see that you\u2019re going to see that these other rappers is liars\nSee my Mac is lethal, plus Mac is lethal\nTurn you into macaroni when we blasting people\nSee they\u2019re actors, they got me yelling \u201cAction people!\u201d\nDig them up kill them again just like an action sequel\nEverybody sound the same but it's just overkill\nPut a hole in your chest see what your soul reveal\nGot a rusty Black and Decker, call it Woody Woodpecker\nThen I vrrmmmm in your heart so you can know the drill\n\n[Hook: Chamillionaire & *Mac Lethal*]\nYou see the truth is\nI lose my cool quick\nDon\u2019t make me lose it\nYou\u2019ll see what lewd is\nYou see the truth is\nI\u2019m not like you kid\nSo don\u2019t be foolish\nI just might prove it\nJust try not to piss me off\n*You should tell them not to piss me off*\n*Because I\u2019ll turn them into history y\u2019all* (Don\u2019t piss me off)\n*So please, just please don\u2019t piss me off* (Don\u2019t piss me off)\n*You should tell them not to piss me off*\n*Because I\u2019ll turn them into history y\u2019all* (Don\u2019t piss me off)\n*So please, just please don\u2019t piss me off* (Don\u2019t piss me off)\n\n[Mac Lethal]\nI was calm for a minute, but I started off angry\nAnd didn\u2019t kill everybody, thank me\nI\u2019m the only human being in the fucking world that got rabies\nDigging up your garden, shitting in your daisies (Woof)\nPut some candy in my bowl\nI\u2019m always trying to run away from animal control\nI\u2019m a ghost, I\u2019m a ghoul, I\u2019m a demon, I\u2019m a rogue\nI\u2019m a screaming little toad, I\u2019m a phantom with no soul\nGoddamnit I\u2019ll kill you, and even if you kill me\nThey're gonna think I let you like I\u2019m Anderson Silva\nMan fuck all the radio bullshit\nFuck anything that\u2019s watered down like American pilsner\nNow Mac Lethal, man, what the fuck is wrong with him?\nEven Tech N9ne won\u2019t do a song with him\nIf a rapper got a girl, man, she going to quit him\nI\u2019ll stretch him out until his epidermis don\u2019t fit him (ah)\nI give fuck about a bitch being trill\nShe can give brain in the kitchen like Richie Aprile\nDrink wine in a warm red glass\nSpitting game to a dame with a fine little corn-fed ass\nLike Mike Tyson I beat it up until she couldn\u2019t walk\nTold if she isn\u2019t trying to fornicate she shouldn\u2019t talk (Uh)\nI never spoil her\nI just tell her all the Breaking Bad spoilers\nFuck all the mockery you\u2019re making\nEvery single tooth, every bone every fossil I\u2019m breaking\nMac Lethal got the fucking soccer moms shaking\nLike they popping and they breaking\nSaying \u201cAs-salamu alaykum\u201d\nEverybody sounds the same and it\u2019s just overkill\nIn fact, most rap groups sound like Soul for Real\nIf you don\u2019t want to get your soldiers killed\nYou better throw your shield\nAnd head over hills\nYou know the drill\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Mac Lethal]\nHey, Chamillionaire.
