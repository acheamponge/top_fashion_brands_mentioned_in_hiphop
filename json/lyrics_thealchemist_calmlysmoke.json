Shit, only Lord knows\nSo I exhale, inhale again, did it for my little man\n'Cause he's in jail again, need bail again\nGotta get rid of this shitty feeling\nAlchemist, get your nigga higher than a New York City building\n(Roll another one, and another one)\nSour diesel haze, kush mixed with the bubble gum, call it troublesome\n'Cause the only thing that calm the Ghost\nIs a deep beat, zone out and calmly smoke", "title": "Calmly Smoke", "album": "The Alchemist Cookbook"}], "artist": "The Alchemist"}
