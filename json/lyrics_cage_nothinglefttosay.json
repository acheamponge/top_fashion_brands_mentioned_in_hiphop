(It\u2019s always sunny in\nHell)\n\nI have one thing left to say, I\u2019d like to share it with you\nIf you don\u2019t care is it too bad for me or too bad for you?\nI know it\u2019s complicated, he suffered he tried to make it\nNow maggots just want to be compensated and live through Camu\n\nLive through Camu\n\nYou picked at his flesh the day of his death astounding\nA WM on his arm and a circle around it\nI'd like to think what he left behind you could really use it\nInstead of saying his name just to move your shitty music\n\nThe day I feel the need to stand in a bathroom\nAnd shovel cocaine into a human vacuum\nI\u2019ll look you up, the day I need another hole in my face\nWhen you pass away people think that your checking your myspace\n\nThen your enemies give you public head quick\nSo why not at my funeral just pull out my dead dick\nThought to project see him at the gates they let him in\nI guess they needed you as much as we do yet again\n\nI looked to the sky and opened my eyes then the weathermen\nSymbol in the clouds just a memory of my friend\nHe stuck his head in the future where they sing his art\nWhere the wild card will be crowned the king of hearts\n\nIf I had things left to say, why would I share it with you?\nHow you suck the life from the dead is even too low for you\nThe time you spent depleted, his soul has just left so beat it\nGo join the kids and eat it up and tell them how you knew Camu"}]}
