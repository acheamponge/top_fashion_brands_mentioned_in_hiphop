{"artist": "ILL BILL", "songs": [{"title": "Overkill", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nI make ruthless records consecutive\nDisconnect your wig, wet you in your living room\nDisrespect your crib, spit fire at you\nPop pop, cause your body to ooze\nBill, anything I spit's uncle Howie approved\nThere ain't no justice and there ain't no peace\nThese mean streets are like the evil dead eager to feast\nSoul chasers will leave you diseased, what you get dealing with creeps\nPeople sleep until we cause the desert eagles to speak\nThere's no love and no loyalty left\nLearn ya lesson, the hood shot rich porter to death\nOnly the hood die young, rest in peace to Jam Masta Jay\nBiggie and Pac, and all the rest who passed away\nI'm like an animal, trying to survive\nStriving for a better tomorrow, the world's full of terror and sorrow\nTears drop from a little baby boy or girl\nWhile the push of a button could destroy the world\n\n[Hook X2]\nIt's a overkill, no escaping this we raping this homie\nIt's a overkill, expose to nuclear radiation\nIt's a overkill, push the chromosone chromosplode\nIt's a overkill, peep the overfiend overload\n\n[Verse 2]\nHit you with the nine shell in your head like Kleinfeld\nMy mind's swelled, I laugh at it like Seinfeld or Larry David\nThen blast off like Larry Davis\nWe carry bangers and air you out like airplane hangers\nI rock 5 star general status, projects to Paris\nAt the Hilton sticking foreign objects in Paris\nI'm very paranoid tell me what they asked you? Splash you\nNuke you like fast food, splatter you when I clap tools\nI keep it simple like grass roots, attack troops\nGhetto gorillas in track suits, wet up your whole shit like a bathroom\nI catch fools slipping and hit 'em with capsules of blow cause cash rules\nThe truth newport carton junkies and street trash, wheat grass\nCustomers cop hundreds of weed bags\nYeah I was chosen to kill those who are smoking the krills\nSold it to you out the old seville, yo you know the drill\n\n[Hook X2]\n\n[Verse 3]\nGo overboard, this is Ill Bill the overlord, go to war\nI approach you with a trojan horse, entire armies are slaughtered\nExplosions of gore, soldiers fall, hot enough to cause your bones to dissolve\nGo through walls, Let the don use it, mix it with orange juice and abuse it\nThrow your guns in the air and lose it, gangstas and goons with uzis\nWe underhanded money, rubberbanded the son of sam, son of man\nPeople too stupid to understand, I'm the host with the most\nTravel coast to coast, rolling like nostra coke, when I post the toast\nLeave you wetter than PCP dispose of folks, loced out leave you with holes\nYour clothes are soaked, you fucking shithead your thought process is idiotic\nIt gets worse blow a hole in your head, leave you retarded, look at you know\nStupid fuck see what you started, I won't stop till all of are dearly departed\n\n[Hook X2]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fc526dae683e1f19f37ee02105da9a7c.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "What\u2019s Wrong With Bill?", "year": "2004-05-04"}]}
