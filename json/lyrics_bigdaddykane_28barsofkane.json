All I need is just a pen\nSheer excellence, to say thus far\nYou can ask Isaac Newton how you greet a star\nYou asked for 16, I went way too far\nAnd I gave you 28, just to raise the bars", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1321503841_BDK%20fade.jpg", "year": null, "title": "28 Bars Of Kane", "album": null}]}
