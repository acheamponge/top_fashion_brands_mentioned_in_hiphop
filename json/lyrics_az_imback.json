I'm back!)\n\n[AZ]\nSent to express grace\nSeperate the weaker niggas is the best way, fuck how y'all feel\nY'all cowards now fuckin with real\nI return like McGrady got caught with a pill, let's get it poppin\nI move like a nigga coppin\nI know the stress from the streets when I was diddy-boppin\nPlayin the corners face to face with the faces of mourners\nIt's hard to trace the informers until it's too late, Jake rest on my corners\nThe focus is back, I play a part in this culture of rap\nBought some whips so I relate on how these vultures attack\nFlippin and runnin, double-park, rippin up summons\nHow many niggas hittin twin sisters and flippin they cousins?\nCall it finesse, the game give it all I posess\nNothin changed, I'mma ball to the death\n\n(Yeahhhhhhh, yeah-e-yeah.. I'm back!)\n\n[El Shaber]\nYeah, that's right\nShow these cats how we do this here nigga\n\nI'm like a, rose in the desert but how can one grow without rain?\nHow can one experience happiness without pain?\nAnd how could I fall to the violence of hell and still remain sane?\nAnd how could I still remain on top of my game?\nWhen both the black and white devils seek the power to rebel\nSeek to defy my radiance, I shift gears to another level\nI'm focused, but it's like I'm playin a cold hand of spades\nI got a lot of hearts, but these fools tryin to cut me\nAnd I'm tired of these jokers\nVengeance is mine, I plague the whole planet with locusts\nI survived the mayhem, my advantage I've been the brokest\nI wasn't drugged and inhaled by all the smokers\nThen I became the love absorbed by all the cultures\nI can't trust women because my heart was scorned\nIt's hard to trust yo' comrades, when yo' heart was torn\nOne-nine-seven-oh the God was born..\n\n(Yeahhhhhhh, yeah-e-yeah.. I'm back!)", "year": "2001-09-18"}]}
