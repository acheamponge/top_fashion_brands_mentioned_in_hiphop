Well tell her she's a winner\nAyy, she a bad lil' sumn'\nLove how she dance like Michael Jackson\nTold me I would be number one\nJust be yourself, don't be nothin' like them\n\n[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]\nYou can be you today, you can be you tonight\nKnow you're feelin' really great, it's gon' be alright\nI can see it in your face and I know you wanna fly\nSo get off your ass and create your life\n\n[Post-Chorus: A$AP Ferg]\n'Cause you're missin' opportunities\nI know you're rich in opportunities\nAnd you're missin' opportunities\nI know you're rich in opportunities\nOh, oh, oh", "year": "2016-04-14"}]}
