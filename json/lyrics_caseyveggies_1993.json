I don't know\nYou and [?] hit me up, said it's time to rock the show\nThe crowd like swag, I'ma blow, let's go\nAnd she asks what's gon' happen to her when the fame come\nI said girl, that ain't gon' change nothing\nBut how really would I know\nWhy am I so attached every time she wanna go\nIt's almost like I can't let go\nLet me know man, God told me I'm my own man\nTime fly, I'm getting grown man\nMy mom's like \"Casey, watch your tone, man\"\nI said \"Sorry I was spazzing out\"\n[?] I'm running my mouth\nSo if I haven't figured out, you don't know what I'm about\nYou'll prolly never figure out\n\n[Hook]\nShe wanna know what it feel like\n[?]\nWe in love and it feel right\nWe gon' be grinding all night, night\nShe wanna know what it feel like\n[?]\nWe in love and it feel right\nWe gon' be grinding all night\n\n[Outro]\nI was born in 1993, you feel me"}]}
