This life ain\u2019t natural\nDon\u2019t make touch on government, the streets are like the capital\nAnd Christianity is magical, they make you think\nThat you cannot finish a date without smoking, I\u2019ll take a drink\nThis is not a story, some think it\u2019s all a game\nMost of us sold to the Devil just for a taste of fame\nAnd so they pull something heavy, metal splatter your brain\nIt\u2019s not a game when you watch a pistol shatter your frame\nIt\u2019s pain and pleasure, you mix a little together\nThen let it rise to the top and then popping, you get the measure\nThe president is a veteran sodomizing his people\nTo make you believe the words that he\u2019s speaking\nNaturally evil\n\n[Hook]\n\nThis is that heavy metal shit\nDon\u2019t even meddle with\nI keep a four just in case yo I gotta settle shit\nYou ain\u2019t a veteran, I got some medicine\nDon\u2019t even act like you\u2019re tough, homie\nYou\u2019re better then\nAnd this ain\u2019t for the radio, don\u2019t even play it, ho\nThe metal music to lose it, you know it\u2019s crazy yo\nAnd this is how it\u2019s going down, let off a hundred rounds\nOf metal music now can you hear the sound?\n\n[Ill Bill]\n\nI\u2019m giving you heroin for your ears\nListen close, homie. This is dope\nGet your adrenaline pumping like you was sniffing coke\nRide the lightning, cult leader my mind\u2019s frightening\nI drink blood from a human skull like a Viking\nTo toast the death of my enemies\nI command an army of blood thirsty murderers with heads like machines\nI\u2019m the future of this piece of shit scene\nAbandon all hope and these fake fucking faggots\nI\u2019mma snatch up all their bling\nGot you stuck in the moment, zoning advanced but fucked up like cloning\nI\u2019m the evolution of super soldiers\nHuman vultures, better yet I\u2019m exploding like super novas\nMoving in circles of tyrannical goons with toasters\nThe face of the Devil, chased by the bass and the treble\nThe gunfight erupts amongst fallen saints in the temple\nThis is Ill Bill making the metal bang like Slip Knot\nWith twin Glocks, thirty-six shots, you get your wig popped\n\n[Hook]\n\nIt officially starts, the takeover, the takeover\n\n> > Lyrics posted by heroin4yourears < <", "image": "https://images.genius.com/99ff63951f21bd5532d81bd64d3cbd69.800x800x1.jpg", "album": "ILL Bill Is The Future Vol. II", "year": null}]}
