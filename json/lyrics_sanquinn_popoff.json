Come with me]\nI'll show you where the check break fast\nAnd we bust heads fast\nIf a nigga not in single file\nRun up on him single style\nLet the thing break him down\nYou love my methods\nTake a nigga off the Earth if he on my shit list reckless\nThe key copper\nHave to eat proper\nBitches lookin' for guidance\nHad to be proper\nTone Capone is the beat dropper\nThe jump off is jumpin' off proper\nAnd it's about to get hotter\n\nChorus: Keak Da Sneak\n[Come with me]\nTil it pop off\nAnd you better be ready for the jump off\n[Come with me]\nTil it pop off\nAnd you better be ready for the jump off\n[Come with me]\nTil it pop off\nAnd you better be ready for the jump off\n[Come with me]\n\n[Keak Da Sneak]\nI still rep Walnut Street in deep East Oakland\nThe 100 block where you can your whole shit broken\nLike Mystikal \"Still Smokin\"\nThe life ??\nAnd rent free\nI never let nothin' live on my mind\nI gotta grind [grind], shine\nAnd fight for my grandma\nAnd don't do nothin' stupid like Hammer\nTil I go bankrupt\nSteady drinkin' til I finish my cup\nThen bust ya head before I shoot up the gut\nFresh outta Folsom and proper beef injections\nChosen selections\nCuz girl I ain't fuckin' without protection\nI'm harder than erection\nTeachers so you study your lessons\nAnd advise for that viewer discretion\nOn a scale to 1 to 10 I get 11\nGive a toast to the pussy like Devin\nAnd beat it up off Sprite and Seagram 7\nI've plottin' on a way to get rich\nAnd keep bread out that cock\nAnd all the folks in the hood aimin' for head\nShots of lead poppin'\nSituation's crucial\nAnd every nigga I'm wit is feelin' neutral\nFuck takin' 10 paces\nAnd drawin' down\nThis ain't no Western movie\nRoll a Swisher, pass it to Ric\nSat the window wit the doobie\nI'm lookin' at booty\nOnion ass on the strip\nYou fine but baby girl where your whip\nIt's jumpin' off\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Juvenile]\nWhile I'm outtie on the West\nI got the best weed\nAnd the best hoes\nI'm on the block at all times dressed in the best clothes\nMy focus is money cuz pussy come natural\nI only fuck wit those that can show me some collateral\nI deal 'em all off top\nI ain't a child molester or a killer\nI don't need y'all props\nShit, if she wit me, she know what it is\nWe hotellin' and you don't deserve to go to the crib\nIf yo potna wanna roll she can roll\nI ain't gotta touch\nI like to smoke and watch you freaky hoes\nAnd I could have my choice\nEnie, meenie, miney, mo\nBust a nut, get the fuck\nPlay it how it go\nMy main ho called and told me she made some money\nI said \"Bitch you ain't never come gave it to me!\"\nHow many woman now done wanna get gangsta for me\nGotta be willin' to get down on your hands and stomach\n[Are you ready?]\n\n[Chorus]", "album": "I Give You My Word"}], "artist": "San Quinn"}
