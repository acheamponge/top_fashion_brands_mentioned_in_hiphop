The way these niggas rapping's a shame\nIf they wasn't so lame I'd be saying they name\nGet your own shit nigga trying to merge in my lane\nCrash into another car avoiding the thrashing plane\n\n[Verse 3: \"Morgue\" by Wiley]\nStressed out nigga 'bout to lose my mind\nThe whole damn time I've been thinking about crying\nCause' mind fucked up and I'm fucked up\nSo I get fucked up gone ?\n? Don't waste my time\n? Don't waste my time\nTake this nick hit a lick get a dollar\nCome back and see me been here this whole time\nSmoking on gas thats toxic, say it flew in from the tropic\n? just profit\nNeed that money because i need them boxes\nMind on the green like the ? Celtics\nNine tucked right by the pelvis\nFiends nodding off on the toilet like Elvis\nHave a nigga thinking how the fuck do i sell this\n'Cause i fucking need that money, hit that block couple miles and running\nGotta get them ten, twenties, fifties and hundreds\nHave a nigga locked doing time doing dumb shit\nSo i gotta just think it smarter\nGotta get this money for my daughter\nDog this ain't the eighty nine ? in that cutlass and that shit have you locked before you even get started\n\n[Verse 4: \"Eskimo\" by Wiley]\nI come from a dark past but guess what bitch got a bright future\nThese bitches feeling freaky because my diamonds going Kama Sutra\n'Bout to make a power move, smoking on ?\nUsed to hustle in shower shoes until I got like I had my own shower shoes\nNow these niggas got me on Igor, smell just like the seashore\nShots of my ? serving B more\nI made 200 racks off a D-tour\nOn the interstate with them ? traffic\nStopped my ? but that spot still ? and bouncing\nSo much money I might need counselling\nHad that forty in my Pelle Pelle\nTrapping in that rolling Telly\nI was ? out of town\nStacking up trying to cop a chevy\nSo if you ain't talking about money then you ain't talking about nothing\nGet the fuck out my face because my ? so rambunctious", "year": null}], "artist": "Danny Brown"}
