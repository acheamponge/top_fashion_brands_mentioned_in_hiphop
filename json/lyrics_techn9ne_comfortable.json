Unbomfortable\n\n[Chorus]\nI feel comfortable here\nComfortable here\nComfortable here\nI feel comfortable here\nComfortable here\nComfortable here\n\n[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]\nYo, I'm comfortable talking to Mark Alford\nHe don't make me feel I gotta kneel at a dark altar\nHis colleagues are cool, things are jolly and smooth\nAnything else, it'll be part stupid and part awkward\nDo your homework before you talk to a vet\nThat way you won't get no static comin' from Tech\nI'm on my own Planet, I'm in my zone, dammit\nI see a lot of you and wonder just how you drones manage\nYou niggas don't get it at all, the wicked\nYou get it delivered to y'all and give it a negative critic\nKnow when I spit it them people are giving the calls\nRequesting me, I'm blessed and free\nYou want Tech the G, you must step to me\nI ain't beggin' for no petty press, I'm already set\nDone a lot of work with Travis that made our fetti stretch\nEven though I'm Michael Myers, I still get steady checks\nBut yo when I'm slicin' haters I leave a Freddy mess\n\n[Outro: Tech N9ne]\nFrom Rocked Rhyme sessions, the top I'm steppin'\nBut I'm no longer steppin' in Hot 9-7\nTill the powers that be travel to see the spot N9ne's reppin', yeah\nComfortable here\nComfortable here\nComfortable here"}], "artist": "Tech N9ne"}
