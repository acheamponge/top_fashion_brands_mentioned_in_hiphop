It Was All So Simplistic\nSipping On My Sorrow While It's Washing It Away\nTrying To Add Color To These Shades Of Grey\nAnd Trying To Make Sense Out Of All This Confusion\nEmbrace My Reality And Unmask Illusions, Holograms\nI Advance On A Quest With Many Questions\nDistracted For A Second But I Know That I Destined\nCounting My Blessing, Renewed Everyday\nAnd I Know I'd Never Grow Without These Shades Of Grey\nWhat Could Drive A Man Off A Cliff, Lost In Thoughts\nAnalyze Life To Find What's Real And What's Not\nForgotten Faces, Flashing Through My Conscience\nA Conquest For Freedom, Constant Forward Motion\nLeaving Egypt, Past Erased From Attachment\nTo Start From Scratch With The Bricks That Established\nMy True Identity, Secret To Most\nDeeper Then Known, I'm Keeping It Close, To My Heart\nWritten On Stone Tablets, Alone In My Magic\nAdvice Projected, Correcting Bad Habits\nLaughing As I Drowned In Mystical Tears\nMind Consumed By Thoughts That My Physical Fears\nI Can't, Listen With Ears, Cause Words Will Deceive\nAs I Stand Up Against Darker Versions Of Me\nLooking Over My Shoulder, Waiting For False Moves\nDancing Around Land-Mines And Get Lost In The Grove\nWhat Happens?, When All The Light Slowly Fades Away\nAnd You Try To See God Inside A Shades Of Grey\nHe's Ever-Present, Through Our Mistakes Flaws And Folly\nHe Could Have Left Me Falling, But Instead He Called Me\nAnd I Answered, Silent And Unsure What To Say\nJust Thanking Him For Life Even With The Shades Of Grey\n\nThis Life Is Unpredictable, No Limits Or Restrictions\nIt's Filled With Opportunities And Filled With Addictions\nSo Much Joy, Yet So Much Affliction\nPain And Oppression, Shame And Conviction\nSo Much We See Yet, So Much we're Missing\nSo Much To Change And So Much we're Fixing\nFaith And Forgiveness, Chaos Destruction\nPoverty, Paychecks, Starving Children And Corporate Lunches\nLove, Peace, War, Hate And Hunger\nFall, Winter, Spring, Summer, Sunshine And Thunder\nI'm Going Under, Now I'm Rising\nHow Much Time Is Left? There's No Rewinding\nSometimes Even The Light Can Seem Blinding\nI Wash My Thoughts In Blood To Keep My Mind Clean\nI Don't Have Everything I Want\nI've Always Had Everything I Needed Everything Hasn?t Always Went How I Planned It\nBut I Wouldn?t Change Who I Am Even If You Offered Me A Mansion\nJust Existing Is Enough, Just Living\nI'll Do My Best To Make The Right Decisions\nUntil The Day Heaven Takes Me Away\nI'm Gonna Make The Most Of Life Even With The Shades Of Grey", "year": null, "album": "Shades of Grey"}], "artist": "Braille"}
