I'm getting wreckless\nGremlin nights dark, gun shots pop like Sprite\nSpirit here is Satan, Graphite\nUnlimited lead, lead you into my life\nAll I do is write, all I see is wrong\nI just try to write, squatting in a home\nSqueeze through the aluminum back door\nHittin' licks as a kid, I learned it from my sight\nDid what i did, I tried to forget\nI almost forget, it disappeared\nCause my nephew cry at night, and I hear that shit all the way upstairs\nAll under one roof, like, how you live like this?\nWater that drip, on molly that sip\nI get zooted as I can get, all under one roof\nProof I'm here, on some real shit gotta get out of here\n\n[Verse 2]\nYoung ass negro, never had much\nCouldn't take shit, backed up\nNo paper towel, used the rag for my ass\nBut, I added all my luck, up\nCause the places I been, I could've been touched\nUsed to traffic, zips on the bus\nFrom portfolios to AK47 bud, trying to make ends touch\nWin us something we can be proud of\nWords from the dust, dust on powder\nHow can a nothing-ass-nigga tell me how to live my life\nIf his fucked up? If your light so bright\nWhy your head fucked up? Thinking they can make something off your name\nNiggas just trying to come up with some type of plot\nTrying to get down, its my money now\nHow did you end up with more than me?\nY'all niggas slick scamming how you think you gon' fool me?"}]}
