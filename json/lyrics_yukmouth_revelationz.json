Revelationz\nListen\nWhy do the good die young, an the bad mutha fuckas live fo ever?\nCuz nigga, we livin on hell nigga\nThis is hell mutha fuckas\n\nVerse 1\n\nUh\nAll my life it's like I'm fuckin around wit the wrong people\nMake a movie about my life an it be a long sequel\nBout people livin off free-be's an brick cheese\nThat's how that shit be's, out here you have to grind to get g's\nNo Bently flippin less yo name is Felix Mitchell listen\nLittle boys an girls my mama could barely pay the fuckin rentin\nMy daddy is surely gotta be somewhere in this world pimpin\nWhite bitches fo doe, he was a jiggalo livin in women\nHe used to take me an my Village potnas to go swimmin\nHe drove a BMW, they father drove a lemon\nNigga in the end my mama kept spendin money on gin an drugs\nI had to sleep on the fuckin rug where the roaches was\nI hung wit thugs always rollin dice an pumpin gas\nTo get some cash\nYou had to store the coke, we mop his ass\nMy pops would give me cash, but my mama would take it from me\nIf I didn't give it to her, she'd beat my ass butt-naked homie\nThe only way I would see a movie was out wit the homies\nI'm always bummy, had no money, they would pay it fo me\nMy daddy told me when I was very young\nThat he was on the run, I heard him mention somethin about Colombians\nAn I could come stay wit him if I didn't like the way that moms treat me\nI juss didn't like the way that moms beat me\nWit Tonka toys, in front of my boys hit me wit objects\nSo I juss\nGot to sky the fuck up out these projects\nI left behind my moms an sisters so relentless\nNever thought they'd get evicted an be sleepin on benches\nMy pops was on some pimp shit, sewin up Frisco on novero\n5-0 kicked down the door, he flushed the elbow\nThere goes another nigga straight to the pen\nBy the age 10, done lived wit every relative, an friend I know\nHere I go again\nLivin wit my grama, then my auntie\nMy uncle\nWhere ever I go niggas would gank me fo my bundle\nSwindle my check, wit Section 8 an medi-cal benefits\nBut me I wasn't gettin shit\nSpend my shit on nay kids\nThat's what they did\nFuck relatives\nIf I don't do my thang now, I never lived\nNever gone get it if you sit on yo ass\nSo fuck math class\nI'm on the Ave wit crack fo that ass\nLike son like dad\nI love the smell of money, hash an zig-zags\nLook at the back of my ass, beat the sag, it's big cash\nInvolved but\nWe all get caught up an sent to juvenille halls\nScrape yo turf on the wall, in county drawls\nMy mama abused alcohol\nMy pops an inmate\nAn me I'm sweepin halls to intake\nHate\nMy mama carried the weight ain't seen my pops since '86\nEvery year, in an outta jail fo crazy shit\nSo much shady shit done happened to me, I can't put it behind me\nThe Lord took my mama life in '93\nGod bless her soul\nCuz she was caught up in a, house hold fire at a rehab so we sued they\nAss\nThis shit makin me mad\nHigh ass lawyer we had Melvin Bell, I tried to tell my sister that he'd\nGet paid half\nSettlement, me 56 G's\nMy big sister 56 G's\nMy little sister 106 G's\nRipley's won't believe that for the life of my mama they only gave us a\nQuarter a mill ticket to split\nI can't deal wit this shit\nI wish you was here to see me get this deal wit Chris, an Noo-Trybe\nMama you died I cried\nCuz you missed\nThe gold an platinum plaques\nI bet you never thought yo little black ass son could rap\nNow I'm breakin off scratch\nAn burnin zags wit Sparkle\nThat's my little sister askin the Lord why did you make her life so\nAwful\nNext thing you know my pops go\nIn '95 he died of AID's\nIt's either suicide of cry fo days\nAn weeks an months\nBlowin blunts, keep away flashes\nNo funeral caskets, juss two vases wit ashes\nI ask if, he spare my life\nCuz all I got is my nieces, my two sisters, an my wife\nRecite behind the mic the type of shit that niggas like\nFo the first time in my life I'm makin bread, doin it right\nBut at night seems like I'm hunted\nProbably because jackmoves an licks I've done it\nWhat goes around comes around, hollow point tip rounds to my stomach\nBitches\nScreamin at Summit\nThat's how you busta niggas want it\nBut I still juss get blunted in big six hundreds\nNiggas done, done it\nDone deal nigga, been there like Dre\nBlowin hay in the air on the free-way\nPray\nForgive me God is what I would say\nI gotta lot of days to count\nBlessed, went from claimin sets wit yay up in my mouth\nSee task an bounce\nNow I blow hash at half an ounce\nSmoke out to the facial blessed to be livin on hell mutha fucka!\n\nCuz this is hell nigga\nIf you ain't know, nigga\nThis hell nigga\nRight now\nArmegeddon\nNigga, done deal\nDone deal\nUh\nThis live\nEvery nigga done had this shit happen to 'em, you know what I'm sayin\nAll my potnas, every nigga I tell that I went through, they do, done did\nThe same shit\nLet's do it, juss salute niggas\nJuss do our thang, fuck everybody, let's ride this shit\nDo yo t hang blaze, get shermed out all that shit, whatever\nMushrooms an shit, Xtacy's an all that shit, let's get high an juss\nReminise about all that dangerous shit we done went through\nAn ask yoself....\"why the fuck am I here?\"\nCuz this is hell nigga\nAn the good die early, an the mutha fuckin bad stay fo ever, cuz yo ass\nOn hell nigga, cuz you a bad mutha fucka like me\nDone deal, uh,
