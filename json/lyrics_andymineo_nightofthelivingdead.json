Jesus came to make dead people live\n\n[Verse 1]\nMan, first things first\nThe covenant was made, it was painful and hurt\nThe Savior was slain but he raised from that dirt\nNow I\u2019m covered in His blood, ain\u2019t no stains in my shirt\nHe conquered the grave, now my faith is secure\nCause my God \u2018s still alive while I await his return\nSo people think they safe cause they stay in that church\nBut if they only knew it was by faith and not works\nBy His grace and His mercy, the Father\nHe'll take a sinful man and make him somethin' he outta nada\nHe washed away the dirt that I did when I tried to\nSatisfy my thirst ouside the living water\nOh, what a great mistake, I wasted so many years\nI tried to do it my way instead of doing His\nThat\u2019s probly why I tasted salt from my tears\nBut, now I be the salt of the Earth to my peers\nSin brought me so high, but when I came down\nThere wasn\u2019t enough folly to keep my mind sound\nI wanted all the hotties that could get a piece of mind\nBut there wasn\u2019t one hot enough to give me piece of mind\nI wanted fast money, but when I finally got it\nThe only thing that was filled was my front pockets\nI threw all my cash onto kicks and the summer gear\nBy the time I got home I done got my eyes on another pair\nNever satisfied in the pleasures that\u2019s fadin'\nCause I can\u2019t take them to the grave man\nFaith in the stacks of the paper\nNow I only put my faith in the Savior\nIt only makes sense\nI really don\u2019t care if I never make a cent\nIf my pockets full of lint I can still sleep well\nCause the God of the universe know me by my covenant\n\n[Hook] (x2)\nHe saved me\nHe ain\u2019t take a bad man, try to make a good man\nHe just took a dead man, then he let him live\nHe told me get up and walk\nHe told me get up and walk\nHe told me get up and walk\nSo I did\n\n[Outro: Ravi Zacharias]\nMan is not just unethical, he is lost and dead. If man is only lost in guilt, what I have given to you is bad news. But he is lost in sin and our great privilege is to tell him he has a savior"}]}
