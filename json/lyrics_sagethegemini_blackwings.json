Yeah, have you seen him?\n\n[Verse]\nYeah, I know that they want me off my level\nTake my place and get my medals\nTake my mind, use me as vessel\nMake your head nod, yeah, you playing with the devil\nThis that heavy metal, you get pot for playing kettle\nI got black wings with no soul, I might might just run up\nOn my nightstand is a .40, I don't cock it 'cause it's one up\nGot me fucking [?] falling luggage, catching cases\nI might run around your corner, look like greyhounds racing\nI'ma run into your mama place\nDisrespectful, wave it in your mama face\nBroke a sprinkler, ha, I let it spray\nHe ain't got a face, we ain't got a case\nBanana clip got me apeshit, I don't make a nigga dayshift\nHe was almost 40, he ain't make it 'cause I was on my 38 shit\n\n[Chorus]\nRed on my clothes, [?] I had to go\nWhen you wearing gold, everybody wanna know\nHave you seen him? Yeah, have you seen him?", "album": "Morse Code"}], "artist": "Sage The Gemini"}
