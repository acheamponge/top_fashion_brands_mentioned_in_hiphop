Show none to foes\nI'm shogun, don't hold guns\nBut know that the flows stun\nSo hoes run, in my direction\nStill striving for perfection\nAddressing shorty undressing\nShe testing I'm heavy stressing\nThe lesson is take lesser hits\nWhen there's messes near\nCause sentences\nGet sentimented into ten\nWith pens I'm ten\nMy flow gold you low bro\nPlus my vocals\nLeave local hoes boastful\nThey happier than me\nShit\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm used to being alone\nJust me and symphonies\nNow I'm never home\nAnd the bloggers eager to get to me\nVividly, living these dreams\nThat others wish to me\nFiling beats, writing these lines\nThat bring them to their feet\nDefeat is far, no bars\nGo far as far goes\nWe discard hoes\nAnd disregard harmfuls\nWe harm foes no arms tho just hard flows\nI sparkle, you can spark more\nYou narks know\nI can keep you stressin'\nTo confess about the weapon I was blessin'\nThey just test wit\nNow lets get out of this quickly\nYou trying to get me\nFor holding a piffy\nBut that ain't my history\nDon't diss please\nI'm displeased\nIt's sickening what I been seeing\nRather stricling the flip kings and sing sing\nFlip kings and sing sing\nYeah"}], "artist": "Bishop Nehru"}
