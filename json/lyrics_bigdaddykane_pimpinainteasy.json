Extra! Extra!\nHere is a bachelor comin' straight at ya\nI see trim and bag it, take it home and rag it\nThe Big Daddy law is anti-faggot\nThat means no homosexuality\nWhat's in my pants'll make you see reality\nAnd if you wanna see a smooth black Casanova\nBend over!\nCuz I don't half-step when it comes to broads\nThe K-A-N-E'll go the whole nine yards\nThere's no time for coversation my dear\n(Ohh!) Is all I wanna hear\nSo let's make a move, as I get smooth\nCuz the purpose I serve is to soothe\nI'm tall, dark and handsome and all that junk\nEven white girls be sayin' \"Ooh, Kane's a hunk!\"\nEven Puerto Rican girls be callin' me papi\nSome try to copy, but they look sloppy\nSo imitators that wanna step to a\nBrother like me, lick my manure\n\n[Hook]\nAnything goes when it comes to hoes, they go\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\n\n[Verse 3:Smooth B]\nI'm just goin' and I'm flowin' like a gigolo\nAnd when I used to be with Scott, I was a Super-Ho\nBut now I'm coolin' with Kane and Greg N-I-C-E\nAnd if you girlies want my tip they gotta pay a fee\nI love bonin', and all my friends they will agree\nThat when it comes to pimpin' hoes, it ain't easy\nFirst name, Smooth, last name, B\nWhen I'm bonin' a girl, I make her feel heavenly\nI like to make 'em wait, and then make 'em beg\nAnd when I take off my clothes, then I form a third leg\nThey rub it with oils and suck it with ice\nNow I'm sweating, my mind is in paradise\n\n[Hook]\nAnything goes when it comes to hoes, they go\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\n\n[Verse 4: Scoob Lover]\nTip-tip-toein', Scoob Lover's out hoein'\nBraggin' to the fellas how my flattop was growin'\nBuyin' drinks for the ladies, money I was blowin'\nRight in front of me, hmm, not even knowin'\nA brown-skinned cutie; big, plump booty\nNametag earrings readin' off \"Tootie\"\nBullseye, bing, the girl of my dreams\nFrom my eyesight that was what it seemed\nI said, uh, \"Come a little bit closer\"\nTo Scoob that night, choice guy, she said \"Hi\nHi, hi, I've really been wantin' to meet you\nI just got paid and I'll be very glad to treat you\nHow 'bout dinner, a Salisbury steak?\"\nI said, \"Sorry Honey-Dip, but I already ate\"\nSo I nudged the other girlies off my shoulder\nWent for Tootie 'cause the girl was much older\nEast to the Benz, I slowly walked\nClearing out my throat so I cold start my smooth talk\nSex in my mind, I was sure of it\nI wanted to tax that ass like the government\n\n[Hook]\nAnything goes when it comes to hoes, because\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\nAnything goes when it comes to hoes, because\nPimpin' ain't easy (Pimpin' ain't easy)\n\n[Outro: Ant Live]\nWell, it's Friday night, ain't a damn thing funny --\nBitch better have my money", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e5112b31d8bd715b9e736175eff672d9.1000x1000x1.jpg", "year": "1989-09-19", "title": "Pimpin\u2019 Ain\u2019t Easy", "album": "It\u2019s a Big Daddy Thing"}]}
