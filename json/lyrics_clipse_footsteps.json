Well let me teach ya\nFollow my footsteps through tragedy and triumph\nThrough flows give you mein k\u00e4mpf\nKilos consigned 'em, do as I say like Simon\nAnd you too will diamond blind hun\nI'm on my Dylan, Dillinger flow just killing ya\nYou wonder why the real ain't feeling ya, you're frauding\nI Mason jar Martin Margiela them O's together\nSince Hov was name dropping Charles Jourdan\nI kept them nodding, snorting\nSlobbing, barfing, and bought cars off them\nThe realest rapper that's unwrapping got them\nIf you can fit these shoes than walk them\nI parked them\n\n[Hook: Kobe]\nI could have been a goner but I had to save my soul\nI'm out here chasing my dreams, looking for a place to go\nTrying to get up out the ghetto, come follow with my footsteps\nPut down the heavy metal and follow in my footsteps\nCause if you don't, it might be danger\n\n[Verse 2: Malice]\nIt's not for you to do what I do, rather do what I say\nThese footsteps could lead you astray\nLead you to the cell or lead you to a grave\nEither way, you might never see the light of day\nDon't let my wrongs give you the right of way\nTo emulate my past escaping the law's grasp\nTold you the truth, yet who was I to brag?\nEspecially seeing how Kimani finds it hard to laugh\nI miss my homie by she's missing her dad\nIt weighs on my conscience and I hate conscious rap\nApart from that, I wish to see you succeed\nSo I speak to my people in spirit of chuck D\nYou behind the glass, trust me, it cut deep\nAnd the words to every verse haunted me in my sleep\nSo now what you see is Malice's contradiction\nHe who has ears, I hope you're listening, come on\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Malice]\nFollow me like Twitter nigga, you can check the timeline\nI'm the quiet one but my intellect is Einstein\nI'm so unnerved by the shit that I've observed\nJust looking at you coons got a nigga lost for words\nVerge of insanity, I'm at my crossroads\nShame on the birds that led em like lost souls\nWe got it wholesale, we move it like Cosco's\nMercy on the court left us standing here heart broke\n\n[Verse 4: Pusha T]\nI taught you how to cut it, cook it on hot stove\nI taught you how to share them when fucking with hot hoes\nI taught you how to rock right shit up on your toes\nI taught you how to smile for the camera when heartbroke\nI've been the inspiration for all you industry dick tasters\nTo your local dream chaser I am King Push\nI set the stage for all these triple beam hooks\nI weighed mountains while them niggas just sang hooks (yuugh)\n\n[Bridge: Kobe]\nOh, oh, oh, your mama said\nOh, oh, oh, oh, your grandmama said\nOh, oh, oh, oh, your baby sister said\nOh, oh, oh, your nigga said\nOh, oh, oh, now your whole block said\nOh, oh, oh, oh, your old teacher said\nOh, oh, oh, your misses said\nOh, oh, oh, your preacher said, yeah\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Clipse"}
