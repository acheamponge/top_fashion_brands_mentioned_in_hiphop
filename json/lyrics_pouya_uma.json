Better come correct\nI don't give a fuck about your life\nI want you to cut my check\nDamn, you so cool taking pictures with your cigarette\nHow can you lure me when we never met?\nI ain't gonna lie, you look good on the internet\nSee your ass in real life and you really just a simpleton\nSpecial aid rappers talking bout I'm not a lyricist\nKeep on talking sideways, you best be diligent\nI started getting money and I never wanna finish it\nFinna buy my momma something cause I'm really feeling it\nCommissary for my brother, get some tuna fish\nTold that bitch \"Whats up? You acting like a lunatic\"\nShe tried to slap me in my face so I hit her with a pool stick\nShe started crying balling like a bitch\nTelling me that I'm full of shit\nChicken and beer on your breath, bitch you smell like Ludacris\n\n(Fuck you, you stupid bitch, suck a dick, bitch)", "year": "2015-03-25"}]}
