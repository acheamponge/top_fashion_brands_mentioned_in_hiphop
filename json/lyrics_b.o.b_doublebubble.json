Hood rich beeotch.)\nMy niggas on Mooreland Ave. Boulder Cris\nYou got six 12's in the trunk nigga this shit for you\nLet's go. (Hood rich hoe)\n\n[Hook]\nWell baby girl was lookin' at my ride\nSo I guess I'm a have to put her up inside\nShe was with you first now she's sittin' by my side\nThis is what happens every time I drive by\nWhen I'm in that double bubble\nThey give me double bubble\nWhen I'm in that double bubble\nThey give me double bubble\nYeah\n\n[Verse One]\nThey see my whip and be like, \"That's a mean motherfucker\"\nSmothered in cream, make her melt like butter\nBut I don't speak, I throw up the Eastside that mean \"What up? \"\nCome in LZ, so put your system on 'Shut Up'\nI hit the scene, real clean like scrub dum dum\nThey can't compete, they speakers bust the fuck\nMy kick got beat, they kicks be scuffed up\nThey beat, just fluff fluff\nThey weak and scrubbed up\nThey be like, \"Who that is? Can you turn that down? \"\nCause they say I got too many 15's in my ride\nAnd the Alpine is vibratin' they booty, chest and thighs\nSo girls be gettin' juicy wet when they get inside\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Double Bubble", "album": "Who The F#*k Is B.o.B?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d8cefe97bbbe251a84c87f853a533f10.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "B.o.B"}
