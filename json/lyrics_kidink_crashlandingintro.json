This your last chance\nPut on your seatbelts, I'm 'bout to crash land\nThe way I touch down, I should have a dance\nTeach you how to stunt, I could have a class\nRoll another blunt, burn a little hash\nI got my money up and learned to build the math\nAll these green faces like I fucking got the mask\nYou can't walk in my shoes like you fucking got a cast\nSee my riding through the city like I'm racing in the drag\nGot the thing in the bag, put the burner in the pass\nOn the highway of life, think I'm running outta gas\nSee Miss UFO, 20/20 on the tattoo\nTall ass niggas you can never understand\nSaid it's Kid Ink baby, listen, you can hear 'em chant\nI'm the future like I just hopped out of the DeLorean\nGot off world tour, I'll be going back again\nTry to front on a nigga but I'm 'bout to back 'em in\nLadies, Chi-Town veteran but all I do is win\nNever strap up, stretch, do some fucking celestines\nChew you up, spit you out but I ain't motherfucking finished\nNo, I run this shit like I grew up with the sinners\nSmoking on that good tree, you be smoking on the trimmers\nLook around see, everything green like feeling money\nHelp a nigga stay fly, fly like quidditch, ha\nYou niggas just dry old bitches\nI'm the hottest thing moving, start a fire in the winter\nSo raw, little wasabi and some ginger\nIs all I need to eat you motherfuckers up for dinner, tell 'em"}]}
