"lyrics": "[Hook: Sauce Walka]\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI might take your bitch today, I might pour a fifth today\nYacht Master my wrist today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today\nI'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich\nI'm feelin' richer than a bitch\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\n\n[Verse 1: Sauce Walka]\nI'm feelin' richer than a bitch\nBuy a pint, pour a six\nI might just pimp out your bitch\n100 thousand dollars, breaking tricks\nTaking dates and doing back flips\nI'm smoking zips, I ain't selling zips\nAll I do is sell sauce, I send a bitch to your house\nDing ding, right at your door\nI'm with Mozzy and we pouring fours\nI'm with Philthy and we in a Ghost\nInvisible, I feel like a ghost\nSauce Twinz, yeah we do the most\nIt's the reason we got all the hoes\nIt's the reason we do all the shows\nAt 19 I was thirty toes\nOn this and that, really sending hoes\nHitting jewelry, buying rose gold\nNow I buy it by the kilo\nRose gold, subzero\nKick a nigga's ass for the cash\nSpill spill spill spill, split then dash\nI worked hard to be a rich nigga\nI prayed to god to be a rich nigga\n\n[Hook: Sauce Walka]\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI might take your bitch today, I might pour a fifth today\nYacht Master my wrist today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today\nI'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich\nI'm feelin' richer than a bitch\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\n\n[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]\nI'm feeling rich today\nMy bitches hit for 20K\nNow they one week and one day\nYou broke hoes is just in the way\nThe Sauce Twinz was just in the Bay\nWe was just up in the Wraith\nSalute to the nigga Mac Dre\nI pimp on that ho like Mac Dre\nI Fuck four hoes at one time\nNever had four hoes at one time\nNever had four hoes in your life\nI'm sipping a cup of the slime\nI tell that ho look here, she listen\nOne look from the ho and she missing\nThe roof on the foreigns, they missing\nYour diamonds, they don't really glisten\nDesigner is on me, I'm dripping\nThe iron is on me, don't tempt me\nBroke niggas mad so they dissing\nBut no I don't pay it no 'ttention\nI got the bitch down on mission\nI told the ho what is the mission?\nShe only call about chicken\nThe Jackson's, Grant's, and Benjamin's\n\n[Hook: Sauce Walka]\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI might take your bitch today, I might pour a fifth today\nYacht Master my wrist today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today\nI'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich\nI'm feelin' richer than a bitch\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\n\n[Verse 3: Mozzy]\nJumpin' out with them broomsticks\nZoom in and they a youngin'\nDecorate a nigga's residence\nWith that yellow tape and that stripe\nIt's all 50K in my bank, another 20 piece in these denims\nThe four Nicki so saucy, but I ain't leakin' shit when I drip 'em\nCrack the seal and then spill it\nRich today how I'm feeling\nStill sleeping, no squealing\nIt's rich killers and it's dealers\nWord up to these hookers\nBet your bottom bitch that she choose\nGot a von sway beyond ooze\nThat nigga Mozzy one of them dudes\nYou do what you want when you poppin'\nPull up to the lot and then drop it\nPull up and these bitches astonished\nI fuck with the Twinz on my mama\nMy stoogie got nothing but chronic\nI swear I'm the topic of gossip\nThey swear I'm The Plug cause I got it\nWires off and these Robins\n\n[Hook: Sauce Walka]\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI might take your bitch today, I might pour a fifth today\nYacht Master my wrist today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today\nI'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich\nI'm feelin' richer than a bitch\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\n\n[Verse 4: Sancho Saucy]\nI'm feeling rich today, might take your bitch today\nPhilthy Rich drippin' with me too\nSo you know what that pimpin' do\nFive bullets on my fuckin' tooth\nI'm breaking bitches, ain't that the truth\nCan't tell me nothing cause I came from nothing\nAll a bitch can do is make me money\nPinky ring cost 30 onions\nDamn Sancho, that's baby money\nI'm big Sancho, boy I play with money\nYou don't ever conversate with money\nI got killers waiting by my lawn\nIf I call 'em they gon' take you down\nI got bitches out on they grind\nJust in case I ever put this rapping down\n\n[Hook: Sauce Walka]\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI might take your bitch today, I might pour a fifth today\nYacht Master my wrist today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm feeling rich today\nI'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich\nI'm feelin' richer than a bitch\nI'm feeling rich today, I'm feeling rich today\nI'm
