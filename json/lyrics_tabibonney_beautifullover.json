It don't get no better\nMy game like an open letter, while others rely on cheddar\nAnd if the girl don't let him, my wing man will intercept her\nShe is like the beautifulest thing, but I ain't going to sweat her\n\n[Hook:Terri Walker]\nOn and on and on and on and on and on\nOn and on and on and on and on and on\nIt can go forever, you can call me your lover\nSo call me your lover, lover\nOn and on On and on On and on\nOn and on On and on On and on\nIt can go forever, you can call me your lover\nSo call me your lover, lover\n\n[Verse:2]\nI'm falling for her, and we ain't met yet\nIf she got a boyfriend send a death threat\nIf she got a girlfriend send a death threat\nI'm committing murder, I'm the only one that can convert her\nLike I'm overseas with a converter\nPlease just tell me that you know who she is\nIf she break my heart pick up the pieces\nIt's deadly as the she is\nThen she got me tripping, rewind this back just to listen\nLike this is a demo, hello\nI'm tabi Bonney and you are gorgeous\nPlease God take my order\nJust tell me what I got to do for all this\nI put up my mother for adoption just to lock in\nIf there's no other option, she a goner, belly flopping in that water\nI pray to God her ex's ain't distort her\nI pray to God her ex's ain't record her\nFuck it, maybe she just did it for exposure\nBut what if she's the one that's ultimately getting over\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro:Terri walker]\nThe beautifulest thing I've ever known\nJust shut your mouth and take me home\nBoy gon' make me wait too long\nImma need a lover, a rock stone lover\nThe beautifulest lover, lover"}], "artist": "Tabi Bonney"}
