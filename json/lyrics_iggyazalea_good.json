Yeah\n'Cause I'm good, I'm good, I'm good\n\n[Verse 2]\nTop floor, bring the white gold\nEating dinner looking at the view\nSo high, see all of you\nEach and everyone who wanna see me lose\nYou looking at me, but I'm looking through you\nYou tweeting crazy to me, what's it to you?\nFall in line, this is danger for who?\nGet off my ass, you are not a poodle\nI'm just out here fucking living\nCut 'em off, they're forbidden\nTrade the sides, they was tripping\nThey like ''Oh, Iggy, I was kidding!''\nI go to sleep and y'all forgotten\nSorry boo, you're not forgiven\nBring me breakfast while I'm swimming\nI'm just out here fucking living\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm good, I'm good, I'm glad\nTo be right where I am at\nAnd you mad, you mad, you mad\nBut I'm good\n\n[Chorus]\nSo you can say what you want to, yeah\nBut that doesn't phase what I'm gon' do, yeah\nIs that why you stuck in a bad mood? Yeah\n'Cause I'm good, I'm good, I'm good", "image": "https://images.genius.com/19cf63b9755e08ded8b8f990db4ea68a.850x850x1.jpg", "album": "4 My Ratz - EP", "year": "2017-11-07"}]}
