{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[MC Ren:]\nRen is the villain and you're just an hostage\nSo whenever I'm steppin cover your head like an ostrich\nGroupies been waitin for this, suckers been hatin for this\nYou know why ? Because so many are relatin to this\nJealous is how they feel it intentionally\nBut they start to love it becoz I made it eventually\nPumpin the music I keep the music like pumpin\nCoz Ren ain't in here for nuthin, I keep the average crowd jumpin\nYo, you know the color, the villain's in black\nAlways down to make noise, and attack\nSo you better get back unless you wanna come with it\nAnd make your face like a target and close your eyes when I hit it\nYou're screamin with fear but it's with fear that you're screamin\nYou're wakin up in a sweat coz Ren is givin bad dreams and\nI'm not schemin, I'm just tellin the facts\nThat's how it is when N.W.A. starts to jack\nSo brothers that wanna scr*p with me\nThat sweezin and sneezin will have to lap with me\nEspecially beggin to write some lyrics with me\nI just snatch your girl to take a nap with me\nCoz when it comes to Ren there's no comparison\nAnd if you try to be me, it's quite embarassin\nBut I understand coz you're mentally slow\nCoz I can tell from the jump you're too nervous to go\nIf it ain't' ruff it ain't me (scratch)\n[Tha gangsta's black and he's about to attack]\nIf it ain't ruff it ain't me (scratch)\nLemme bust a freestyle here [Allright then]\nI can tell that you're afraid to fight me\nSimple because you lost the crowd and they had to invite me\nBecoz you're sweat as a puddle but there's a puddle o' sweat\nI'm a threath, so get a cold rag and wipe your neck\nAnd clean the dirt off your face that calls acne\nIt's ridiculous thinkin that you can jack me\nThis is the round where the punch will go\nUntil ya A G-A-T that's known as a flow\nI'm makin a point but it's a point that I'm makin\nLike, see, I'm hatin the fakin I keep the suckers like shakin\nScared to speak with a tongue and they're chozen\nThe sound of my voice in their ear and they're frozen\nThis is a battle to the death, it's like the [?? same ol' ??]\nAgainst a brother on a tip, with [??]\nGivin a pain but it's with pain that I'm givin\nBut I'm comparin and tearin'em but I'm makin a livin\nWith the hype of a 9 Volt battery\nAnd the odds for me to conquer is averagely good\nMeanin I'm a flow\nI'm from the streets so, yo, I'm ready to go\nIf it ain't ruff it ain't me [Yo Ren]\n[Tha gangsta's black and he's about to attack]\nIf it ain't ruff it ain't me\n[Man whatcha gonna do now ?] [get funky]\nThe 'do not disturb' sign is in effect\nWhile I'm thinkin of a fool to select\nTo give the victim the verdict so for the verdict a victim\nSlammin my vocals on a dance with the rest then I kick them\nTell'em they're guilty, and beep out the bailer\nAnd get a new track o' drums so I can play with\nPercussion; pumpin it loud when I perform\nYo, you wanna play in my game, put on a uniform\nIt ain't a rule in the book you have to go by\nHey, coz when it comes to cheatin yo you should know I\nFor fear in the hearts coz it's the hearts full of fear\nCoz what you hear in your ear is something funky and clear\nThe hump was incredible yo but Ren he was super\nBut now I'm ruthless, a civilian and not a trooper\nBut a soldier with a top rankin\nGivin dope material, the hell with the gankin\nSo play like an airplane and just jet\nAnd keep your blood pressure low coz I'm a [??], if not\nI'm afraid of the show\nThat you're a sucker and you're too nervous to go\nIf it ain't ruff it ain't me [Yo Ren]\n[The gangsta's black and he's about to attack]\nIf it ain't ruff it ain't me [Yo Ren]\n[The gangsta's black] If it ain't ...
