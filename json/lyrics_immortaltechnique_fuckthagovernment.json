That's just scratchin' the surface!\n\n[Hook]\nFuck tha Government\nFuck tha Government\nFuck tha Government\nFuck tha Government\n\n[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]\nThey say the rebels in Iraq still fight for Saddam\nBut that's bullshit, I'll show you why it's totally wrong\n\u2018Cause if another country invaded the hood tonight\nIt'd be warfare through Harlem and Washington Heights\nI wouldn't be fightin' for Bush or White America's dream\nI'd be fightin' for my people's survival and self-esteem\nI wouldn't fight for racist churches from the South, my nigga\nI'd be fightin' to keep the occupation out, my nigga\nYou ever clock someone who talks shit or look at you wrong?\nImagine if they shot at you and was rapin' your moms\nAnd of course, Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons\nWe sold him that shit after Ronald Reagan's election\nMercenary contractors fightin' a new era\nCorporate military bankin' off the war on terror\nThey controllin' the ghetto with the fear of attack\nTryin' to distract the fact that they engineerin' the crack\nSo I'm strapped, like Lee Malvo, holdin' a sniper rifle\nThese bullets will touch your kids, and I don't mean like Michael\nYour body be sent to the morgue, stripped down and recycled\nI fire on house niggas that support you and like you\n\u2018Cause innocent people get murdered in the struggle daily\nAnd poor people never get shit and struggle daily\nThis ain't no alien conspiracy theory, this shit is real\nWritten on the dollar underneath the Masonic seal", "image": "https://images.genius.com/ec6d7cca1c838d43d77eca6ea756ed8a.223x223x1.jpg", "album": "Fuck Tha Government", "year": null}]}
