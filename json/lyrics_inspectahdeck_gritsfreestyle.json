I don't sleep, stay aware from the plots\nBump 'em off right there in the spot\nThis is harder than a prison wall, shut up and listen y'all\nHG's, UDZ's, physically fit to brawl\nS.I.N.Y., certified, keep, out of town pussy on the passenger side\nAnd crews, east side, splashing the five, mashing the drive\nBig face nigga, fashion is live\nLike son, check the bodies 'fore you buy that gun\nFuck with HG's, nah, don't try that son\nHere's a jewel for you kid, you can eye that one\nOr you can get it fucked up and just die that young\nI'm from the home where the buffalo roam\nAnd niggas don't give a flying fuck, talk with signs up\nWalk with the nine tucked, leave your eyes wide shut\nSize you up for a cut, of a single buck\n\n[Outro: Inspectah Deck]\nYeah, we from the grits, y'all\nS.I.N.Y., 10304, my nigga Live Son on the track\nYeah.. \"The Fugitive\" Carlton Fisk, what's good?\nLa Banga...
