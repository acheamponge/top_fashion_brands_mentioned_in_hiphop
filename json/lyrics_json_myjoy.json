Why should I complain?\nWhen you want to whisper\nNever said a thing\nAll of my moments of God to see took me temporary\nWhen I began to think about all of the things you have thrown because you love me\nI know that you love me\nThe weight of this world trying to pull me down\nBut I think that you without me begin to smile\nJoy you bring me joy\nYou bring me joy\nYou bring me joy\nYou are my joy\nMomentary, that y'all preparing me for eternal glory\nMomentary, that y'all preparing me for eternal glory yea\nAffixtures momentary, momentary affixtures\nDon't compare to the glory we'll witness\nWhen his holiness hits us and we're blown away\nWe behold his face and all his pain will be thrown away\nInside the pit, where the story was rolled away\nPretty ain't it? There's no other way to paint it\nThis for every believer who has choose to trust\nIn him who endured the pain and a cross who's truly crushed for us\nAll of my moments of God to see took me temporary\nWhen I began to think about all of the things you have thrown because you love me\nI know that you love me\nThe weight of this world trying to pull me down\nBut I think that you without me begin to smile\nJoy you bring me joy\nYou bring me joy\nYou bring me joy\nYou are my joy\nMomentary, that y'all preparing me for eternal glory\nMomentary, that y'all preparing me for eternal glory yea\nMomentary, that y'all preparing me for eternal glory\nMomentary, that y'all preparing me for eternal glory yea"}], "artist": "Json"}
