How could you do it?\n\n[Verse 3: Big Sean]\nOkay now baby here we go, we go, no baby, me go\nYou got my heart, baby this what it beat for\nI give it all, walk as far as my feet go\nWhat you mean \"me go?\" Why can't it be \"we go\"?\nWhat happens when people turn to tears? (huh?)\nDreams turn to memories and weeks turn to years, huh?\nBeen standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks\nGive me my feelings back, wish love came with a couple receipts\nMan, our vacation was coming next week\nGirl, I swear you was a trip, let's make it a couples' retreat\n(Do it!) How could my girl do this to me?\nWoke up to a note saying \"The world did this to me\"\nNow I'm testing, one-two, reporting live from the rubble\nDrinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you\nOne, two, three, four, five models on the double\nGive me head all at once, look like they lying in a huddle\nBut it's not even half the feeling\nAs hearing your \"Seans, you know I love you\"\nShedding tears everyday (I know you do)\nAnd I'm tired of lying in these puddles\nI ask \"Why?\" sometimes like a fucking vowel\nBeen hitting trees everyday like a fucking owl\nTrying to get high enough to cut the clouds\nOf the Phoenix Sun and Nash it out\nI mean ash it out so I could see you smile\nI-I know you can see me now\n\n[Hook: Mos Def]\nDon't look down, it's an impossible view\nFly like an eagle, whatever you do\nDon't look down, it's an impossible view\nSpread your wings, aerial"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
