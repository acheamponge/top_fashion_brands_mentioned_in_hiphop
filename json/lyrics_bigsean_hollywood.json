New grid\nWith a house up on the hill\nHow I feel next to the sign that say, \"Hollywood\"\nBut I don't mean to act Hollywood\nBut my bitch is the baddest, ass is bigger than Jurassic\nShe moved out West, now she talking with an accent\nHad a good doctor, now her titties look like plastic\nUsed to go to college, now she like, \"Fuck a master!\"\nShe gon' date an actor, rapper, lawyer, or a doctor\nSomebody who could cop for her, get a ice rock for her\nMaybe get a ring, she should date a boxer\nAnd her friends don't even recognize her\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Earlly Mac]\nOoh, little mama, you so primadonna\nWhy you treat your Honda like it's a McLaren\nI know you like nice things, Tiffany's and ice rings\nSeen you down in campus\nMarch is colder than that ice ring\nFinna get your shade on, with your supermodel\nHe ain't gotta spill up though, I know he's super hollow\nAnd I know you shallow ever since you hit that lotto\nYou been more in {bravo} like you want a pile o' [Cash]\nWhile you play in roles, you in movies, you got Emmies\nYou got Benjies in your Fendi, does your Charger have a Hemi?\nIf no, let it go, wait a minute 'til you blow\nThey're gon' say you're Hollywood\nThey're just trying to steal the show\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro: Big Sean]\nDo it"}], "artist": "Big Sean"}
