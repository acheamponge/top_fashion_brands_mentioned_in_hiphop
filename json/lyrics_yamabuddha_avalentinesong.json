It's like something that I've always said\nEven if i live for a hundred years, I'm always here\nBaby I'm always there, night and day for you\nI could never let you go away coz I care for you\nMake you mine forever, prolly marry you\nAnd we could make a house home like a family do\nCoz if you ever plan to move away from ya woman\nWhen times are hard dealing with then what kinda man is you?\nBut yo! this man is true, I'm a big fan of you\nDon't know about other chicks but I could handle you\nWe could go out whenever do whatever you wanna do\nCoz you're my number one and there's no number two\nBaby you wonderful, an angel heaven sent\nThe only girl I'm comfortable with sentiments\nEven when I'm very tensed, you steal smiles from me\nLike! no matter what I'm always by your side honey\n\nLyrics Submitted by: CyberPunk", "title": "A Valentine Song"}]}
