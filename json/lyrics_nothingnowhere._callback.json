Really hope so\nYou deserve the best and nothing less\n\n[Chorus]\nYou held my hands, looked me in the face\nYou said you needed space, and you never called back\nWas I a mistake? Something to replace?\nSomeone to throw away? I'll wait for you to call back\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nYou held my hands, looked me in the face\nYou said you needed space, and you never called back\nWas I a mistake? Something to replace?\nSomeone to throw away? I'll wait for you to call back\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I've been going through the motions\nEven though I've been broken\nEven though you left me high and dry\nIt's a wonder why I'm still hoping\nSame shit, just a different day\nI don't get why I can't turn the page\nIce cold since you went away\nI can feel it all running in my veins\nAnd I can still feel it and I can still see your reflection\nAnd nowadays I don't feel anything but the depression\nAnd I don't get why I can't move on and live in the present\nIt's like the past is my home and I'm working on trying to forget it\n\n[Chorus]\nYou held my hands, looked me in the face\nYou said you needed space, and you never called back\nWas I a mistake? Something to replace?\nSomeone to throw away? I'll wait for you to call back\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, I don't want to wake up anymore\nWhen every day is feeling longer than the day before\nYou got, well, everything that you asked for\nJust let me be face down on the fucking floor\n\n[Chorus]\nYou held my hands, looked me in the face\nYou said you needed space, and you never called back\nWas I a mistake? Something to replace?\nSomeone to throw away? I'll wait for you to call back\n\n[Outro]\nDo you forgive me?\nTook you for granted and I brought this on myself\n'Cause I'll forgive you for leaving me\nIt was all my fucking fault"}], "artist": "\u200bnothing,nowhere."}
