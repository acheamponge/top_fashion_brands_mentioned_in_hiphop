Only time will tell\n\n[Chorus]\nWhoa-oh\nWhoa-oh\nWhoa-oh\nWhoa-oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nI done spent some time chasin' women that don't give a shit\nI done learned my lessons and I ain't never gon' forget\nStarted callin' this shit, started ballin' and shit, started flickin' that wrist\nThey ain't never listened, now I'm makin' them hits so I'm fuckin' your bitch\nNo, it ain't that difficult for me to forget that you ever exist\nBet you remember my name when I pull up in that whip that doesn't exist (Skrrt)\nSpill lean on Supreme last Saturday\nLet that shit splash, motherfucker talk saucey\nPass me them drugs, motherfucker let me try 'em\nAt the White House, call my homie Joe Biden, he flyin' out weed\nSmokin' my dope, Bathing Ape, that be the clothe\nMan, don't be silly, that shit you rockin' is old\nLike it's years since you been to the store\nFeel like Meek Milly but I ain't from Philly\nI'm poppin' a wheelie, I show off my grillie\nI do this for real-y and for my fam-ily\nSame shit every night, man, it's all so famil'-y\nThe bitches they killin' me\nLike, bitch, are you kiddin' me?\nBallin', that shit Jason Kiddin' me\nYou can't get rid of me\nYeah you want my chain and my chi bitch I\u2019m real good at chemistry\n\n[Chorus]\nWhoa-oh\nWhoa-oh\nWhoa-oh\nWhoa-oh", "year": "2016-12-09"}]}
