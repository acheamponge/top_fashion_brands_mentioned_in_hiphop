I think you need somethin'\nLike a tall iced coffee, add the Stevia\nTo get the energy to tell your girl that you're leavin' her\nNa, it won't happen, but just give me your word\nThat if it does you'll call me up so I'm the first to have heard\nYeah I blocked you, I wished upon a castration\nBut I guess this is just a tequila situation 'cause\n\n[Hook]\nI want you still, I want you still\nI want you still, I hate you but\nI want you still\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo if you ever wanna just come by and chill\nI know you'll call me when it starts gettin' rocky\nAnd I'll be happy just to hang out\nWith Miyazaki movies and please, I don't mean to be cocky\nBut I know you think about me after too many sakes\n\n[Outro]\nJust, stop me"}]}
