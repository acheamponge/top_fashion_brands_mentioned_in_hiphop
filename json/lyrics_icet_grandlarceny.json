The ICE will\nAnd once I'm in effect it's overkill\nKinda like a hold-up.all the tickets sold up\nAnd then the black stretch limo cold rolls up\nAnd then the posse breaks,high off the Cold Duck\nAnd then I set the mic to show destruct\nEven if we open up,it don't mean nothing\nI rock the rhymes.E does the cuttin'\nCall it shownappin' I take a hostage a night\nDo shit and break out on the next flight\nThis is Grand Larceny\n\nGrand Larceny\n\nI'm a kleptomaniac when a jam is packed\nYou can fight all night,but you'll still get jacked\nBy the show stealer,crime rhyme dealer\nRap king pin,L.A. big-wheeler\nGot a posse so strong they could lift a tank\nRob a bank\nBut now we steal shows the cops say thanks\nBreathe easy cause the Syndicate deep\nBefore we start rappin'\nThey got no sleep\nThis is Grand Larceny\n\nGrand Larceny\n\nJust give me a beat,give me a stage to stand on\nI know that none ya'll ever planned on\nA dude from L.A. who could rock shit this way\nHave his record go gold,with no radio play\nBut it happened,The Ice is rappin'\nJust listen to my fans that are clappin'\nOr come to my show.sit in the front row\nAnd watch me steal the motherfucker before your ass can say \"HO\"\nI'm like a time bomb,but I'm a rhyme bomb\nSpray the whole audience with napalm\nOr something just as hot,I'll bust a rhyme,why not?\nRap hittin' so hard,you'll think you shot\nI'll take a show and abduct it\nStone cold house it,and if it gets wild\nWith gasoline I'll douse it\nSet it ablaze,and then I'll stomp it out\nMany burnt emcees know what I'm talkin' about\nThis is Grand Larceny\n\nPromoters on my tail now\nCause they billed me low\nHere I am 'bout to steal another show\nSo they turn my mic down\nFuck up my audio sound\nBut too late,we just dogged another town\nRappin' like a Mac 10,as soon as I begin\nThe only way to stop the stealin'\nIs throw me in the pen\nBut that will never happen\nCause I'm just cool rappin'\nMy Larceny is legal,so sorry Captain\nI would never steal a rap\nBut I'll steal a show in a minute\nIt's as simple as that\nAn interstate crook,my pistol's my rhyme book\nAny show that I'm on is a show that's took\nBetter watch my left hook,or your jaw will get shook\nIf my posse gets mad,it's best you book\nFrom the Grand Larcenist,ICE-T is my name\nGot a rap like a mac,and a game he same\n\nThis is Grand Larceny (x3)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/90b363e617bc82f06e45c5cc1d830e6a.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Power", "year": "1988-09-13"}]}
