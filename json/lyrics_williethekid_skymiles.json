We buzzing like a transmitter\nThese niggas bitter, slipping like a transmission\nI'm Brita, spring water with the flow\nBreak the bank like it's brittle, brush money like bristles\nOfficial, a root canal, bicuspid\nI'm on the cusp of these bucks, not a husband\nBut I'm in love with the money fuck it lusting\nLong like the hair of Rumpelstiltskin, I'm Teddy Ruxpin\nHold my grizzly, Willie gets busy\nThe fly Jet Life insure Met Life, right?\nHot Spitta with me, never a Dull Moment\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fb7f2ca0fb83754f516a9273bc047313.320x320x1.jpg", "album": "Pearls", "title": "Sky Miles"}]}
