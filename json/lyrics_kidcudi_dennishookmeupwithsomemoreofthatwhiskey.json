I told you what that is, that's a alien bruv, believe it\n(Those guys didn't think I would do it, I told you I was gonna do it)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSee, I could never have a desk job\nMy work take a nigga abroad\nMeeting up late with foreign broads\nRelaxing cause a nigga hustle hard\nMan I gotta take a load off\nNeed a dime that'll take her clothes off\nTook a trip out to Doha\nFilmin' short films on a whim\nGot dinner in a few with prince Sheikh\nKanye changed a nigga life twice\nGotta ride, gotta rep, ay\nGetting rid of all the dead weight\nNiggas really want me dead, hate\nNot my fault I'm intriguing\nDrinkin' and drivin': no weavin'\nPop a molly, feelin' ten again\nProject X type weekend\nExcept a nigga damn near thirty\nLike twenty one had never ended\nHere I go with my second wind, bitch\nYou already know I'm goin' in\nAnd I've been waitin'\nI've been waitin' to shit on you\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, G.O.O.D. music we the family\nKid motherfuckin' Cudi"}]}
