poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nSay, say you gettin money, we, we ain't seen nothin\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nSay, say you gettin money, we, we ain't seen nothin\nI pull up to the club, jumpin out of Rovers\nLookin like a car show, thats the way we roll up\nDope boys showin love, all the hoes know of us\nNeed extra security, they know they can't control us\nI see some niggas hatin, I keep that Super Soaker\nSo I VIP my way, standin on the sofas\nNow watch me demonstrate the way a playa 'possed to\nI done buried your weight, you know we throw them toasts up\nSay youre gettin guap, well, shawty, we ain't heard bout it\nFinna set up shop, well, we ain't even worried bout it\nWord on the block, oh, they say you servin pies\nI think you need to stop, I got some killers that'll get that work up out 'em\nI dont got love for you busta's, unless you my kinfolk\nYeah, you smell that fruity fruit every time the wind blow\nI throw away that chump change, Im all about that bigger dough\nJoc, he a hood nigga, just like Gorilla Zoe\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nSay, say you gettin money, we, we ain't seen nothin\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nSay, say you gettin money, we, we ain't seen nothin\nWhen the money start droppin all the hoes start jockin\nWhen them hoes start jockin bottles start poppin\nWhen them bottles start poppin you know that we're not stoppin\nIma keep bringin bottles then them models start flockin\nIma throw a stack, she gon' throw it back\nI pop the rubber band, she gon' pop her back\nShe know that I ball, she gon' grind the wall\nShe gon' bust it open for me and my dawgs\nGot boys in the club comin fresh from the trap\nWatch them boys cuff their girls cuz they know we got them stacks\nWe in the middle of the flow from blowin cush packs\nI got my workers in the bathroom sellin pill packs\nNow the 40 dont stop cuz they know we got that guap\nShe gon' make her booty clap and Ima throw another knot\nWhen the money still phat they know that its a wrap\nBottle poppin over here, tell the DJ run it back\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nSay, say you gettin money, we, we ain't seen nothin\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nSay, say you gettin money, we, we ain't seen nothin\nWhen my nigga Steve died, you know we popped them bottles\nNiggas tried to run and hide, we went lookin with them choppers\nNow its time to take a ride in that all black Impala\nIf you niggas think Im lyin' I put that on my momma\nAnd thats why every time his birthday come up\nIma hit the town from sun down to sun up\nBuy a couple rounds til they all get drug up\nFor my nigga Im a clown like the number 1 stunner\nYeah, we in the club, my niggas on a pill or two\nThrow that bitch a dub, tell that hoe Im feeling you\nPour her some of this bub, yeah, thats what Im finna do\nAnd then I ask the question, \"Shorty what youre in to?\"\nThen she started blushing, told me bring a friend or two\nA whole lot of rubbers, we gon' cut her like a Ginsu\nFlexin 'bout some money, thats the shit beginners do\nShe know Im gettin money and she wanna be a winner too\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nSay, say you gettin money, we, we ain't seen nothin\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake it)\nWe bottle poppin, we, we bottle poppin\n(Shake it, shake it, shake
