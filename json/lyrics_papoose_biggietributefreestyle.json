Their coke never expanded\nThem niggas better learn the Ten Crack Commandments\nGun charge at a young age, they locked me up\nCause I was hypnotized by Machine Gun Funk\nWhat goes around comes around, you don't get away with nothing\nYou gotta face the consequence like Joe Budden\nIf New York niggas keep rapping like they from Miami\nI ain't going back to Cali, I'm going back to Cali\n.40 Caliber, scream and gimme the loot\nHe can't tuck a gun, his skinny jeans skinny as Snoop\nAnd dice high to the sky, you can die in a minute\nIf you lying in your lyrics cause the sky is the limit\nYou raps is unbelievable, you ready to lie\nWe ready to kill and we ready to die\nPusha T got beef with Young Money, disbelief\nDidn't Biggie let you niggas know what's beef?\nWho shot ya? You're nobody 'till somebody kills you\nLong kiss goodnight, I'm warning what I will do\nI reached my peek, I can't speak\nCall Kay Slay, tell him that my will was weak\nBefore I let you outta town and murder New York\nI'll kill hip hop myself, suicidal thoughts", "year": null}]}
