You know? Man\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nLookin' out my loft windows man my dreams became true\nLookin' at the mirror, wondering if it's the same dude\nLookin' at my closet wondering if it's all about clothes\nLook right next to me, wondering if it's all about\nHop in the car and asked the OnStar where this life goes\nAnd I drive so fast I blur the light post\nThey say Drive Slow, I say \"I know\"\nThen errrr, away I go\nAnd the way I flew\nIn this year or two\nI know this is what God put me here to do\nBut in this excitement\nYou just might miss\nA shorty with a demo like \"Hey, you might like this\"\nAnd see\nHe\nRemind me of me\nJust a year ago\nNow he\nTellin' me\nI'm his her-ro-oh\nI took his CD and asked him what he's lookin' for\nHe said, \"Man, I don't know. Maybe a miracle\"\n\n[Verse 2: Patti Labelle]\nTime, they say (true story, [kanye west])\nThere ain't no way\nYour dreams are gone see the light of day\nDon't believe\nThat you can't achieve\nWhatever you're after\nYou can't be swayed\nBy the simple minds\nThat wanna hold you down\nAnd in His time\nThe pain you carry\nWill be left far behind\n\n[Pre-Hook: (Patti Labelle) and Mary Mary]\nIf you listen to the sermons\nAnd ask the Lord for guidance\nYou will see the many blessings (blessings you have received)\nWhen you give Him all the glory (glory)\nGonna talk to, don't ignore thee (ignore thee)\nListen to all the stories\nMeant to sing Your name\n\n[Hook]\nDon't let no one stand in your light\nChange the way you feel inside\nNobody on this earth\nCan tell you what your worth\nStand up, your the child of The King\nAnd you can do anything\n\n[Verse 3: Patti Labelle]\nYou try to please everyone\nTime to live your life\nRelease those old illusions\nStop wasting time and\nStart embracing\nHis light and let it shine\n\n[Verse 4: Patti Labelle]\n(Don't you listen) when they say\n(You won't make it) oh it ain't no way\n(Through the madness) never stop believing in yourself\nIn the morning you'll see\nAll the answers that free\nYou from chains that would seem\nTo keep you standing still\n\n[Hook]\nDon't let no one stand in your light\nChange the way you feel inside\nNobody on this earth\nCan tell you what your worth\nStand up, your the child of The King\nAnd you can do anything\n\n[Verse 5: Consequence]\nI got an angel on my shoulder and I know he been warning me\nTo stay out the clubs where the police and warrants be\nCause that will lead to prison where the inmates and wardens be\nBut a lot of times we follow them when we know we ought to leave\nAnd stay up in the party when we know that we ought to leave\nBut the women be callin' me\nThe liquor be callin' me\nAnd what's the sense in Cons tippin' strippers named Diamond?\nIf he gonna be conflicted no different than diamonds\nAnd the Lord is the only one that he can confide in\nSo I don't know how you think that you could deny Him\nI open up the Book and the message is clear\nBut I still be in the hood so the pressure is there\nTo grab at that fast money just to get out of Queens\nTo bag up the work that they give out to fiends\nBut that ain't gonna work if I say what I mean\nCause at the end of the day I'm trying to Get Out My Dreams\n\n[Hook x2]\nDon't let no one stand in your light\nChange the way you feel inside\nNobody on this earth\nCan tell you what your worth\nStand up, your a child of The King\nAnd I can do anything\n\n[Outro]\nOh yes I can\nYes I can\nI can do all things [?]\nNobody on this earth can tell you what you're worth\nYou're a child of The King\nNever stop believing in yourself\nThe way you feel inside\nNobody on this earth\nStand up, stand up\nAnd you can do anything\n(Hallelujah)"}], "artist": "Kanye West"}
