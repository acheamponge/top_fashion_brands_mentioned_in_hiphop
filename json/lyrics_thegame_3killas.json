When niggas spend money on Jacob's\nAnd it's that same shit that get blood spilled on the pavement\nI'm patiently waitin', for God to open heaven' gates and\nI'll take a knife in my heart before I murder my neighbor\nAnd for that I'm hated, 'cause most of they rhymin' is basic\nDropped one album and left the whole world stuck in amazement\nStarted with Rakim, found him in my mom's basement\nOne demo tape and I'm on Em and Dr. Dre shit\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3 - Techniec]\nThe 'hood got me feelin' like my back against the wall but I been here before\nLet me fly or give me death, while I'm in here for dough\nMy pops used to hustle the corner in Lotto kicks\nAttempt to try 'em on, didn't like that fit\nWent after a record deal, shit I got that spit\nBesides niggas ain't flyer than Tech at this shit\nI'm a natural nigga, so it's only right to boss up\nAfter these figures, so classical nigga\nHad to document the avenue, study the set\nBack to the OG's, create a new avenue nigga\nSo we could ride, rims spinnin' off the chrome\nCheck the rearview, Wave spittin' off the dome\nHoney, the Westcoast is on\n\n[Hook]"}]}
