Vordul Mega - \u201cMindcontrol\u201d\n[Emcee(s): Vordul Mega and billy woods]\n[Producer(s): DJ Marmaduke]\n\n[Verse 1: Vordul Mega]\nIn the lands of trash-baggage and who got\nThe fattest pockets, hotel lobbies\nWith children blasting rockets, streets\nIs red, green got the minds high and\nUneven, puffing like a fire-breathing on\nThe strip, where people concealing creatures of death\nSee lasers from mechanical lenses\nIn dark-blue nights, we need freedoms\n\u2018Cause the powers than be abuse rights\nAnd working fields with low wages got peeps\nTight and uncomfortable (Like) like industries\nWith jerking deals while we in streets\nHaul ass, working wheels in the machine, getting\nBills to work on wheels and float\nSome feel hopeless with dreams lost\nSeeing ghosts.  Yo\n\n[Hook: Vordul Mega]\nProtect your cortex traveling\nAn unknown vortex.  Never know\nWhere you could be seen or found.  Hold your\nGround.  You might need a pound just\nTo get down.  Protect your cerebral\nCortex traveling an unknown vortex\nNever know where you could be seen or found\nJust hold it down for the...\n\n[Verse 2: billy woods]\nCerebral\nCortex, titanium alloy, cranium\nSubterranean, fiber optic fly alien\nJuggling weapons-grade uranium\nBlowing cold fusion equations outside Giants\nStadium.  A mind is a terrible thing\nTo taste\u2014somebody say grace.  Cannibals\nHere setting extra plates, commence pulling\nBrains through your face.  Thinking for yourself, might\nCatch a case, Thought Police crashing gates\nAutomated tribunals in space.  Minority\nReports misplaced.  Undisclosed locations\nSuspended animation, data recovery teams\nAre freemasons.  Want to see the future?\nCome to my basement.  It\u2019s all fun and games since\nYour memory we\u2019re erasing\n\n[Verse 3: Vordul Mega]\nThrough the madness\nEscape the tragedies of fire\nBlown from metal.  A Earth with no more\nPlastics, Mad Maxes with ratchets and masks\nSteam released from gaskets\nAnger for years, time wasting, falsi-\n-fication of saviors in tabernacles\nBeen tackled in rumbles, living in advanced\nJungles, with little girls on cellphones\nThat blow bubbles, and everybody love the first\nTime they got in trouble, but the plan is\nHouses and lands, and the way things\nIs looking, I also got to get me some\nAutomatic lasers, goggles and cans\n\n[Bridge: billy woods]\nProtect your cortex\n\n[Verse 4: billy woods]\nThree-way telescreen overdubs your dreams\nIn the ministry of love, no one can hear you scream.  Semi-conscious\nStreams of thought beam, pixelated somber fiends\nLicking power sockets, cock the\nSpacely sprocket in the pocket like, \u201cYou gon\u2019 pay me\nOr not, kid?\u201d  Surface to air rocket\nCrash this cockpit and stinger.  Missiles for tubs\nAnd Crockett and anyone else scheming to put woods on a docket\nHomo sapiens, upgrade your grey\nMatter or get rebooted, Timbs-stupid\nYour cerebellum splattered like pancake batter, soft like\nYour chatter.  Mechanoid rappers, witness the rapture\nBrainwaves captured, minds realer than tattered\nFilaments, reconfigured antimatter\nRewind it through the looking glass shattered, it\u2019s the Mad\nHatter, dome swollen like a camel\u2019s bladder\n\n[Hook: Vordul Mega]\nProtect your cortex traveling\nAn unknown vortex.  Never know\nWhere you could be seen or found.  Hold your\nGround.  You might need a pound just\nTo get down.  Protect your cerebral\nCortex traveling an unknown vortex\nNever know where you could be seen or found\nJust hold it down"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
