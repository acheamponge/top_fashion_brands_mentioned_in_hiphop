Who has it?\nYou blowing up, that's good, fantastic\nThat y'all, it's like that ya'll\nI don't really give a f*ck about it at all\nCause the same people that tried to black ball me\nForgot about two things, my black balls\nUh, look, Uh uh\nI let you into my diary to admire me\nThe making of this man, I let you see the higher me\nThe self righteous drug dealer dichotomy\nI'm drawn from both sides, I am Siamese\nThe tug-of-war opens the door, entrada\nRip me apart and see what's inside of this pi\u00f1ata\nAnd rolling kilos in Gymstrada, that's one saga\nOne chapter of black magic, I'm Harry Potter\nFeels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who\nRelationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom\nAnd blossom, I swear this Vegas night was f*cking awesome\nBut adios, I blow my own dice before I toss 'em\nLoss some niggas, some other niggas double-crossed 'em\nTryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune\nWrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen\nRick Flair with the flame, I'm muthaf*cking gorgeous, woah\nAs the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith\nWhiter than that coke brush did they paint me with\nSunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss\nBut they devil-red, tires double tread\nI postin parks up, that gives me double head\nTight rope walking, tryna keep a level head\nThe bright lights blind, look at what the devil did\nYuugh!", "year": null}]}
