Aren't you scared we'll get you?'\n'Look for me all you want\u2014you're not gonna find me though.'\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nCrack backs heavy on the cash all night\nAt the drug site we hung tight\nThree o'clock in the night ounces of blow dirty kicks\nMoney gets low in the street yo\nTough times nickles that's bigger than dimes\nYou know the flavor\nRoughneck city; ain't nuttin sweet kid ain't nothin pretty\nNew York be poppin the cork on crime look at the nine\nSummertime in the courthouse, aw shit it wasn't mine\nTwo to four, three to nine, Benetton'd it what\nWe all ran, fuck grams, you outta luck\nYoung bucks carrying gats, stay strapped for what\nWe all safe from the po-lig, nobody bust\nFREEZE! We in the breeze with the blunts\nNobody drop the trees or they fronts\nMeet up on the roof, look off the front, play low\nWatch out for po'-po', that's how it go, three in the whip\nWe not that legit though, run for the gusto\nPeep Marcel and Brown comin around dippin' the logo\nRun if you ever got somethin' on you son\nYou best to run, be off the set\nJet, bounce from the projects, season of the vick\nWeed in your piss and parole gots ta have it\nSlide like a rabbit move quick this is it\nHang jump from the fire escape, I made it\nDrop the clip fingerprints all on it\nAw fuck those bullets, I'm losin my pants\nI advance my speed, succeed in my travel\nDance on 'em, in a fucked up whip\nMake my heart skip, caught up in the drug traffic\nI absconded, surrounded by the outfit\n120th tried to knock my whole clique\nRun! These black boys that take none\nDon't cop out to shit, take the three to six\nAnd you add that shit\u2014run!\nIf you ever pack a nice sized gun\u2014run!\nIf you sell drugs till your done\u2014run!\nBe the fuck out! Word to God, run hard\n\n[Verse 2]\nBetween two cars we park, pepper got sparked\nIn the dark heads scramble at the six-ooh\nSpies lookin at you one two oh lookin too\nHow you roll what you stole let me see you go nah fuck you\nIf you wasn't a cop I might bust you, I don't trust you\nCoppers lust over my crew, forget a curfew\nWe gather in the plaza to jerk through\n360 with the crime wave, modern day slave\nReversal on appeal, it's not real, plant that\nAs a matter of fact we crackin down, us against brown\nRun fast like you ran track\nNever look back push the Ac' on the sidewalk\nCrash, toss the heat and tear ass\nZig zag 'til you reach your stash\u2014run!\nIf you sell drugs till your done\u2014run!\nBe the fuck out! Word to God, run hard\n\nMe and the God back to back one eight-five with the four-five\nSurvive that shit, you took case, even though I remember your face\nEven though we seen you rollin near Bowling and Greene kid\nThis cream'll get you robbed, knocked if you don't run\nDon't grab my jacket dunn, get the fuck off, break North or go to jail\nWord life is trife, on the block it's too hot\nYou got my man shot, nigga\u2014run!\nWe whylin on Staten Island, it's one thing bein in the bing\nAnd not smilin on the gate, it's too late\nFate held you over, Jakes runnin for snakes\nThe white rover with the plates burn down Gee street\nComin from outta state, see me in the driver's seat\nCoolin without the ID, it's not me\nThat belongs to the god, D-I-V-I-N-E\u2014run!\nIf you sell drugs till they done\u2014run!\nIf you ever pack a nice-sized gun\u2014run!\nIf you wanna still have fun\u2014run!\nBe the fuck out! Word to God, run hard... motherfucker\n\n[Outro]\nRun, motherfucker, run"}]}
