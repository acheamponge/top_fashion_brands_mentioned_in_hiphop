I Shoot to Kill like motherfuckin Mad Lion\nWho is this doin this emphatic type a disco alpha beta\nFunkadelic fuckin emphasis, from the funk abyss\nBlowin up the spot with the pump-rump\nShakin pistol grip, losin niggas in the plot\nI got you out there like Sonny and Cher\nI don't give a fuck niggas goin make me hurt some'in up in here\nYou get that ass kicked quick fast in a hurry\nTryin to ready the mad styles of Mr. Keith Murray\nTryin to step up to my respected bass and treble level\nWill get your head beat in with a shovel\nAnd the only thing that could stop me from gettin sloppy\nIs when the hook comes in by the E-double\n\nCHORUS\n\nI'm sick, I kick the type of shit that make you violent\nMake the jails crowded, and have everybody talkin bout it\nSee I be universally, university\nPurposely droppin it, psychomatically\nWhere I'm from is only real hard times\nSo when I bust on the mic I bust with real hard rhymes\nAnd I'm strapped, with a posse that's ready to snap\nAnd a nigga who make beats like we live in rap\nYou get do fiend on the scene please\nI spread MC's like some old crazy skin disease\nOperation murderation radication on your whole staff\nTryin to find your way down Carlton Ave\n\nCHORUS"}], "artist": "Keith Murray"}
