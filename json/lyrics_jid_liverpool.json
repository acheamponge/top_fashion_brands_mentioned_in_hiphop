Please, oh please!\"\nSo we can find it, and it's hard to stay with us\nWe just bleed, we just bleed out the eyeball radius\nThe crimson tears of growing up\nI'm super lifted off that Eucalyptus\nWatching all my foolish visions come into fruition\nWhile you losin' business, you stupid nigga\nThem copy-cat maneuvers ain\u2019t conducive to your movement, nigga\nEating cooch for dinner while she do the dishes\nDirect a choir in my sex attire\nLook at your neighbor, tell your neighbor \"Pull her dress up higher\"\nJust like Elijah when I profit, ain't no bush on fire\nStill ain't believing what he's leaving [?]\nIs he a 5 percenter? Kinda hard to Identify when he\u2019s high, spittin' and his eyes flicker\nThen the sky opened up and that lightning hit him\nI'm like \"Damn, I might actually sound alright on this one\"\nWe camping realer than a jungle in the night on this one\nAnd I\u2019m just chillin', imagine me off of my prescriptions\nBring your camera, your brain might deny your business\nSaid bring your camera, your brain might deny your visions\nSpillage Village! I have no life\n\n[Outro: J.I.D]\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up\nLet me, let me hold up"}], "artist": "JID"}
