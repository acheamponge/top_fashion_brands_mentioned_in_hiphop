GIVE OUR LIVES for the liberation...\nAnd salvation of the Black Nation\nSaints, saviors, soldiers, scholars... healers and killers\nNo longer dead, deaf, dumb and blind out of our mind!\nBRAIN-WASHED with the white men's mind\nNO MORE HOMICIDE!\nNO MORE FRATRICIDE!\nNO MORE SUICIDE, INFANTCIDE AND... GENOCIDE!\nLook that goddamn white man in his COLD... blue-eyes\nDevil don't even TRY... We Bebe's Kids!\nWe DON'T die... we... MULTIPLY!\nYou heard the Death Side\nOpen your black eyes for the REBIRTH...\nResurrection... and rise!", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/89a02ab603eae95e0d380fcd08eda589.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "Death Certificate", "year": "1991-10-29"}]}
