No matter what, you ride?\nIs you with me right or wrong? No matter what, you slide?\nIf this rap shit don't work, I'm goin' straight to the block\nIf this rap shit don't work, I'm no braining an opp\nIf this rap shit don't work, say fuck the chains that I bought\nPut a bullet in my brain, pistol cock, yeah\nI just pray I leave like McQueen\nYoung nigga, had to spread my wings\nWe the last of a dying breed\nI ain't do nothin' but just chase my dreams\nHad me begging please\nHad me on my knees\nI was blind, yeah, I couldn't see\nHoping God bless another nigga like me", "title": "Broken Pieces"}]}
