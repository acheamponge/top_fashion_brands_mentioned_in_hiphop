I finally made it!\nNo lie, son jumped out a third story window when we got raided\nMy feet never left the floor, I'm on that James Naismith\nSoft spoken, unabraisive\nPolitely asked whitey to loosen the bracelet\nCuba Gooding his way out of central booking\nHot date? I do the cooking\nTurns out she stays up in the Bronx, I'm in Brooklyn\nThat commute ain't appealing\nBest not forget your earrings\nSummer heat searing\nShe's dressed for it so of course the streets is leering\nMy skin's crawling, stomach turning\nThis Bill Belamy cornball honking and swerving\nShe hardly seem to notice, focused like bourbon\nMe? I break up trees on your fourth generation imitation Premier beats\nThat's definitely not the flavor\nAnd trust me you not doing the 90's no favors\nLouie the 14th in a clean glass piece slow motionley major\nTheme music for stolen credit card movements\nThey caught the most etherest of vapor\nWhite suburb, black neighbor\nI'm high like black mayor\nRivet city ransom\nBut the hoe need no savior\nSheesh, she got me repeating myself\nI'm gonna go get the papers, get the papers"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
