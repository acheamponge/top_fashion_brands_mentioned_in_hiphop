Yeah, you get your cash tooken\nEven my street team promote nothin' but ass whoopins\nHow can you win in this world so cruel?\nWhen ya learn the game, niggas change the rules\nYa gotta keep cool, get down and make moves\nShow and prove in this land where cash rules\nIf money makes the world go 'round, then so be it\nI been\ufeff broke before, ain't tryna repeat it\nIf your plan ain't talkin' bout grands, I don't need it\nYa vision ain't picturin' cream? I can't see it\n\n[Percee P]\nA rap battle I can't be in\n'Cause I'll flip on the bastards like a gymnastic champion\nI entertain well, amateurs lose stamina\nTryna examine the lyrics that damage your brain cells\nYeah, I pulled it\nThe gat's trigger on fake black niggas\nAnd wack niggas makin' bullshit\nY'all niggas gotta quit poppin' a lot of shit\nI'm not a bit impressed with your raps, so snap out of it\nFoes with audacity, tryna smash the P\nWon't last with me usin' their full capacity\nRhymes I'll give ya, flow like a river\nWith a high tide, I glide,\ufeff swifter and different from others\nTake a note or two before your shit flops\nAnd you get dropped by the Hip-Hop's Quotable\nCatch the pro at this and Kodak this\n'Cause your wackness can't flow like this, so go practice\nY'all ain't lyrically with it, physically fitted\nTo take a hit, I'll break your shit\nAnd make you quit if you try to get it\nMy rap recital on tracks are vital\nThat's why no one attacks and tries to snatch my title\nIf you're clever, never play me close, champ\nWhen I kick it, I get wicked\nI'm lickin' and stickin' it like a post stamp\nIt takes six, I can make hits accapella\nI should sell a million, never livin' like Rockefeller\nGot deals in the rap field\nThe reason I got bills 'cause I got ill usin' rap skills\nAnd yes, y'all, as I bless, y'all\nIt's me Percee P and Lord Finesse, y'all, fresh, y'all", "year": null}]}
