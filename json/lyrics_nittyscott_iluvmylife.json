I'm just a poet on a train\nA dollar for your cup\nAnd a smile for your game\nMusic is a drug so I take it in the vein\nFeel no pain and distribute bits and pieces of my brain\nMy momma said it's just the God in me present from the fetus\nShe told me to be kind I could be sitting next to Jesus\nMy daddy worked hard everyday just to feed us\nRaised me on Sam Cook and made me a good look\nI used to earn an F and black on that whack test\nCause I wrote bars on the back of that math test\nFocus is vital for my private recital\nFuck the final I just had to get my hand on that vinyl\n[?] will bring it back like a tap to the spinal\nHopscotch, Barrettes and Boombox Cassettes\nHustlers on corners and churches with steeples\nI promise I'll never disconnect from the people\n\n[Hook: 2x]\nI said Im married to the game\nSo I am struggle's wife\nDedicated to the public\nMan I love my life (5x)"}], "artist": "Nitty Scott"}
