The Rugged Man\n\n[Bridge: Rampage]\nPut your hands up, tell 'em wild out\nThis is how we do it, we here to turn it out\nPut your hands up, tell 'em wild out\nThis is how we do it, we here to turn it out\n\n[Verse 1: R.A The Rugged Man]\nYo, my flow reminiscent of a prime Grand Puba\nMy tongue sharper than the swords of the Japanese Yakuza\nBeats always slamming like Dilla, like Ali was the man in Manila\nMan or gorilla, I'm a nicer striker than Anderson Silva\nI'm conquering like Hannibal on the back of an elephant\nI'm the best even if I'm pink and I'm pale and I'm lacking in melanin\nI've been a problem since my first birth date\nIn the delivery room my dick hit the ground and it caused a earthquake\nThe school hallways I was pissing in\nAs a kid I was lacking in discipline\nIgnoring authorities and never listening\nI come from the slummiest of slum villages, killing evil\nYou come from a village of disco dancing village people\nYou other rappers I'm obliterating\nMy flow is the Michelangelo Sistine Chapel\nYou ain't even fingerpainting\nBitch, I'm swinging nunchucks and hitting you dumb fucks\nAnd making you duck down like Ruck and Ruste Juxx\nI'm eyeing you fat bitches and seeing which one fucks\nI'm making the gun bust, I'm bringing the blood guts\nCome on\n\n[Hook]\nI get it done for the (people, people)\nI'm the champ, I'm the champ of the (people, people)\nI bring home the title to the (people, people)\nI'm the motherfucking champ of the (people, people)\nI'm the motherfucking champ of the (people, people)\n\n[Verse 2: R.A. The Rugged Man]\nThis isn't money and a Grammy and an Academy Award\nThis a brutal lyrical verbal version of Gatti and Ward\nIf I bust in your eye, it might blind ya\nAs a kid I was too hyper, sniffing pancakes syrup from Aunt Jemima\nSip wine with Jesus 'till I'm in a drunken stupor\nThen I slap box God and sumo wrestle with Buddha\nI ain't dumbing it down, I'm murdering and gunning it down\nThese others artists I'm above them even if I'm under the ground\nA rapper with a Maybach or a car that my ass can't afford\nI'll rip out the windshield and I'll shit on your dashboard\nDon't make me laugh, young blood newcomer\nYour mother was a crackhead, you a crack baby fresh out of the dumpster\nSmacking ya, hurt ya, I murk ya, massacre mass murder\nBlasting your ass, stashing the burner, the trash lurker\nI'm worser than Rambo in Burma\nI'm dumb in the head, I'm not a fast learner\nThe white boy version of Nat Turner\nCome on\n\n[Hook]\nI get it done for the (people, people)\nI'm the champ, I'm the champ of the (people, people)\nI bring home the title to the (people, people)\nI'm the motherfucking champ of the (people, people)\nI'm the motherfucking champ of the (people, people)\n\n[Verse 3: R.A. The Rugged Man]\nTommy Hearns Marvelous Marvin Hagler with the vernacular\nBullets splattering through your kidney and flying out the back of ya\nI'm shining like diamonds in Africa\nI'm mathematical\nScientifical like Benjamin Banneker\nRowdier than riots in Attica\nI got identity issues, it's self hatred, a pissed off\nWigga acting like I just stepped off of the slaveship\nI kill any beat, murder any track\nMutilate the snare, rape the kick-drum and shit on the hi-hat\nCome on\n\n[Hook]\nI get it done for the (people, people)\nI'm the champ, I'm the champ of the (people, people)\nI bring home the title to the (people, people)\nI'm the motherfucking champ of the (people, people)\nI'm the motherfucking champ of the (people, people)\n\n[Bridge: Rampage]\nPut your hands up, tell 'em wild out\nThis is how we do it, we here to turn it out\nPut your hands up, tell 'em wild out\nThis is how we do it, we here to turn it out\n\n[Outro: R.A. The Rugged Man]\nI let it rock for the (people, people)\nI'm the champ, I'm the champ of the (people, people)\nI really live for the (people, people)\nI'll win it all for the (people, people)\nThat's what we are, we just (people, people)\nI'm the champ, I'm the champ of the (people, people)", "title": "The People\u2019s Champ", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c839ae29cd32413eb20a1c6585d7d604.1000x1000x1.jpg"}]}
