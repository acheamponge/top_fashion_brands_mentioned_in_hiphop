No use\nYou can only abuse\nTurn around now\nYou\u00b4re getting me confused\nGet down, on the dancefloor, now!\n\n(hook)\nI got Mcqueens on tight\nCuz it feels right!\nKeep my lips in your sight\nCuz it feels right!\nBody bends in the club lights\nTouching me is so right\nBegging for a dance, begging for a dance\nMake it hot for me, make it hot for me\nJust make it hot for me\nMake it hot for me, make it hot for me\nJust make it hot for me\n\n(verse 2)\nYou came in desperation\nSeeking my attention\nYou ain\u00b4t Shakespeare\nPlease, persevere\nDon\u00b4t stop! Oh oh you\u00b4re sinking here\nWe might do it every night\n(\u00b4Til the day\u00b4s relieved)\nWe\u00b4ll go out in a dive\nBe a bad boy, on the dancefloor\n\n(Bridge)\nStop, Stop! No use\nYou can only abuse\nTurn around now\nYou\u00b4re getting me confused\nTake a few shots\nShow what you\u00b4ve got\nLet\u00b4s disappear\nLet\u00b4s get out of here\n\n(hook)\nI got Mcqueens on tight\nCuz it feels right!\nKeep my lips in your sight\nCuz it feels right!\nBody bends in the club lights\nTouching me is so right\nBegging for a dance, begging for a dance\nMake it hot for me, make it hot for me\nJust make it hot for me\nMake it hot for me, make it hot for me\nJust make it hot for me\n!!!!!!!!\n\n\nPop pop pop\nHair hair done right\nGold lemonade\nColour shameless eyes\nTemptress hands off\nNaughty on the inside\nPull me closer\nI\u00b4ll show you how\nTo dance right\nPop pop pop\nHair hair done right\nGold lemonade\nColour shameless eyes\nTemptress hands off\nNaughty on the inside\nPull me closer\nI\u00b4ll show you how\nTo dance right\n\n(hook)\nI got Mcqueens on tight\nCuz it feels right!\nLick my lips in your sight\nCuz it feels right!\nBody bends in the club lights\nTouching me is so right\nBegging for a dance, begging for a dance\nMake it hot for me, make it hot for me\nJust make it hot for me\nMake it hot for me, make it hot for me\nJust make it hot for me\nMake it hot for me, make it hot for me\nJust make it hot for me\nMake it hot for me, make it hot for me\nJust make it hot for me", "year": "2012-10-02", "album": "Just Dance 4 Official Tracklist", "image": "https://images.genius.com/733ec7d9fe98cbe45403d9848ff50c95.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "AKA"}
