Stigading wuy na na ding ding wuy!!! Yeah ha ha ha!!!\nYes I waan dem fi know, seh real warriors don't play\nAnd if yuh romp wid us, you have to run away (Run away)\n\n[Hook 2X: Junior Reid]\nI waan dem fi know, seh real gangstas don't play\nAnd if they romp wid us, they have to run away\nKnow they romp wid us and dem a run and a hide (Hide)\nSlip dem go slip and now a slide dem go slide (Slide)\nOnly a fool get caught up in his own pride (Pride)\nHope dem ready fi di ride\n\n[Fabolous]\nGangstas ain't this fly, this is just a rare occasion\nYou can hear it's blazin soon as the leer is raisin\nHell yeah we hazin, sexy pair of Bajans\nChinky eyes dark hair you would swear they Asian\nThey Bahama mamas, hols the llama mamas\nPut the gangsta grills on when it's drama mama\nMurder them, murder them\nThey don't make a move until they get word from him\nI could be in Fiji, one call to Gigi\nShe on some Belly shit like X with a squiggie\nThey say it's gangsta but it's just the way of life\nIf life's a bitch better make everyday your wife\nI'm from the era of the shootouts from drug spots\nHappy to be here so I smile in my mug shots\nThe David Dinkins years, I even dug Koch\nBefore the George Bush drugs watch, Bloodclaat!!!\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Fabolous]\nWe say death before dishonor; the scent that you smellin'\nOn my breath is marijuana 'fore I left to Tijuana\nI told 'em it was war so they nephew or they mama\nBetter wear a tef or they a gonna\nRAH!!! RAH!!! That's what it sounds like when thugs cry\nI see things see wings when the slugs fly\nLow life Loso P wing rugby\nLo to the young niggas I know ready\nI go back like recline no need to rewind\nStill run through Flatbush like the D line\nUsually just the team, plus them extra niggas bein necessary\nJust like a uzi with a beam\nIn the 'cuzzi full of steam, Susie and Jeanine\nNiggas do shit like this or it's usually in they dreams\nGangsta don't sleep unless it's guns by the bed\nEver wonder why the bread gets snatched by the feds\n\n[Hook]", "title": "Gangsta Don\u2019t Play"}]}
