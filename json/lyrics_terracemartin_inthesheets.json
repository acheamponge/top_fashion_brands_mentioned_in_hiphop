Yep, I wanna be your servant\nAs long as I'm with I ain't really trippin', rubbin' on them thighs and proceed to lick the kitty-kitty\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Terrace Martin]\nNow we just got done eating\nAnd a little bit of freakin'\nKissing and huggin' too\nGotta get dressed and go to work boo\nIt's just like yesterday\nI'm missing you like crazy and I see your face\nMeet me at the studio at two o'clock\nAnd I will clear the room and give it to ya non-stop\n(To you)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen I see you in the sheets I hear you calling my name\nOh, oh yes I do\nAnd I know if I can get closer\nYou would let me in your life\n\n[Saxophone Solo: Terrace Martin / Ad-libs: Lloyd]\nOh baby, oh baby\nCalling my name\nI hear you calling my name\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ad-libs: Lloyd]\nCalling my name\nCloser, oh yeah\nTo let me in your life\nTo let me in your life"}], "artist": "Terrace Martin"}
