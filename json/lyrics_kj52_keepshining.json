Goldinchild)\n\n[Chorus:]\n(C'mon) Keep shining shining\n(Set this place on fire)and keep shining shining\n(And let the flame burn higher)Just shine it shine it\n(get 'em up stick 'em up push 'em up)\n\n[Goldinchild:]\nHere we go S.O.I on the song again\nSpit the word and burn bright like halogen\nNo matter the flow the glow gone draw them in\nHe's the light that the dark can't comprehend\nIlluminates hitting things in the hearts of men\nThe lamp that leads men back to God again\nEverything the Old Testament promises\nSon of Man manifested in godliness\nCalling us to be the salt and the light\nReflecting his image in the darkest of nights\nShining the glory that's larger than life\nWe part of the story the author is Christ\nAlpha Omega the start of your life\nThe truth who separates wrong from the right\nLord and Messiah power and might\nGod in the flesh so let there be light\n\n[Chorus:]\n(C'mon) Keep shining shining\n(Set this place on fire)and keep shining shining\n(And let the flame burn higher) Just shine it shine it\n(get 'em up stick 'em up push 'em up)\n\n[KJ-52:]\nSet my life on fire now\nBurn so bright you can't put the fire out\nLet my whole life ignite and just shine about\nTill everyone every time knows what I'm about\nIn every word every line coming out the mouth\nLet it burn let it shine till they find it out\nTill they've heard every rhyme and without a doubt\nThey can learn about Christ the Messiah now\nThey say they need him but they deny it now\nCause you don't want to meet him you just try him out\nAnd every time I see them every time I'm out\nYou ignore what I'm speaking and I rhyme about\nSo let your fire burn never put it out\nIt's time for you and I to take it higher now\nWe gonna call and bring the fire down\nNo matter who you are hear us crying out\n\n[Chorus:]\n(C'mon) Keep shining shining\n(Set this place on fire)and keep shining shining\n(And let the flame burn higher)Just shine it shine it\n(get 'em up stick 'em up push 'em up)\n\n[KJ-52:]\nI'm so sure what I came to do\nCause I don't ever want to ever be ashamed of you\nAnd as the world turns what I say to you\nWell let your word burn like a flame would do\nUntil they all heard what I say and do\nCause I'm so sure they ain't never knew\nListen closer and I'll proclaim to you\nI chose ta approach ya then explain to you\nI told ya showed ya when I came at you\nHe rose up and goes up it was plain in view\nHe said wait for it then in a day or two\nHe straight poured it on out in the upper room\nThen the fire fell on a chosen few\nIt wasn't just done for a couple dudes\nThat power is still around now for me and you\nBut what you gonna do who you gonna choose\n\n[Chorus:]\n(C'mon) Keep shining shining\n(Set this place on fire)and keep shining shining\n(And let the flame burn higher)Just shine it shine it\n(get 'em up stick 'em up push 'em up)"}]}
