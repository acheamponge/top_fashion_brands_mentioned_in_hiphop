On some one, two, three\n\n[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]\nWhere there's a will there's a way.  No?\nWhere there's Will, there's Jada\nI kiss, then piss in the face of a hater\nCongratulate us at afterparties in heaven\nThank God my intro was peace to the 7's\nLet's go!\n\n[Hook: Natacha Elossaint]\nBattle me so you can see (So you can see)\nHow I blast flows (Blast flows) so easily (So easily)\nBattle me so you can see (So you can see)\nHow I blast flows (I blast flows) so easily (So easy for me)\n\n[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]\nI'm the foul author of styles out of order\nI got skills\u2014I could drown you with a cup of water\nSo don't waste my time with stupid questions like, \"Ayyo, you rhyme?\"\nYou don't need to hear my verse\u2014you got enough on your mind\nYou work for who?!?  So?!?  I don't wanna get signed\nMy shadow's chasin' me\u2014basically, I'm ahead of my time\nI'm tryna get this green out the heat like spinach rolls\nSo don't make me put six in your Kenneth Cole\n\"Yo Walz, they hollerin' at you!\"  In a minute, yo!\nI'm tryna score points with the right hooks like Riddick Bowe\nBattle me, don't challenge me with them simple styles\nI'll have your crew sayin', \"WHO!\" like some Temple Owls\nI'm like John Stockton\u2014I don't even have to score\nI just make the game better by bein' out there on the floor\nSo when you ice grill me, instead of breakin' your jaw\nI think Fireballs in your face like a young Drew Barrymore\nCome on!\n\n[Hook: Natacha Elossaint]\nBattle me so you can see (So you can see)\nHow I blast flows (Blast flows) so easily (So easily)\nBattle me so you can see (So you can see)\nHow I blast flows (I blast flows) so easily (So easy for me)\n\n[Verse 3: C-Rayz Walz]\nVerses like these be bullets that speed and rush\nWhile you the type to audition for \"Eden's Crush\"\nI have a group, but they was like, \"He's enough\"\nOkay.  I see the truth\u2014y'all don't believe in us?\nI'll be the proof.  Real emcees succeed and plus\nI'm comin' through ya hood, bumpin' goods in the G's truck\nYou squeeze and bust?  Well, you probably poppin' a bump\nI hope you catch Bucks like Milwaukee\u2014what?!?\nToo much players in the game make it hard to believe\nWhen I got the ball, yo, follow me like a 3-man weave\nMight go out to Tahoe\u2014the Regime was Green\nAnd I cut the iron off\u2014y'all thought I lost some steam\nYou soft!  I'm not the type to force my dream\nOf course I floss V.I.P. without no cream\nYo I got more lines than double dutch tournaments in Harlem\nAnd if I ain't on your roster, your label got problems\nBattle me!\n\n[Hook: Natacha Elossaint]\nBattle me so you can see (So you can see)\nHow I blast flows (Blast flows) so easily (So easily)\nBattle me so you can see (So you can see)\nHow I blast flows (I blast flows) so easily (So easy for me)\n\n[Verse 4: C-Rayz Walz]\nNever been to M\u00e9xico but got ki's from m\u00e9dico\nDeep sea flow\u2014peep my notes with periscopes\nPolice think I pump perico\u2014that's for petty folk\nWho don't know the science of the walk with the blade in his throat\nStill strugglin', but I'm bubblin' to make it clearer\nI ain't seein' myself in a house of mirrors\nTimes is good, but your moms is still in the hood\nStay on my tip and get splinters in ya lip from bitin' the wood\nI'm not Santa's helper\u2014I'm not rappin for free\nNext time you step to C, I'm clappin' ya feet\nPsycho visions\u2014I hear voices.  Listen (Stop calling me!)\nI feel like the Geico Lizard\nAyyo I'm spittin for real\u2014gotta love that, kid\n\"Ayyo, C-Rayz Walz!\"  Man, I love that kid\nIf you're fly, the sky flyin'\u2014for real\nI'm one of those things you could die tryin'\nBuck if you battle me\n\n[Hook: Natacha Elossaint]\nBattle me so you can see (So you can see)\nHow I blast flows (Blast flows) so easily (So easily)\nBattle me so you can see (So you can see)\nHow I blast flows (I blast flows) so easily (So easy for me)\n\n[Outro: Natacha Elossaint]\nSo easy for me\nSo easy for me\nIt's so easy for me\nPeople always tryna step, sayin' they are the best\nBut watch me break them down\u2014that, they must confess\nIt's so easy for me\nOh ohh ohh\nIt's so easy for me\nOh ohh ohh ohh"}]}
