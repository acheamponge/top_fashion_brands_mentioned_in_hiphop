Never seen like a shadow in the dark\nExcept when I unload, see I'll get over the hesitation\nAnd hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration\nGive a little gust of wind and I'm jettin\nBut leave a memory no one'll be forgettin\nSo what about the b**** who got shot? f*** her!\nYou think I give a damn about a b****? I ain't a sucka!\nThis is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever f*** with me\nYou'll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother\nWord to the motherf***er, straight outta Compton\n\nChorus:\n[City of Compton, City of Compton]\n[And that kind of s*** you can't sweep up under no rug you know]", "album": null, "year": null, "title": "Straight outta compton - extended version", "image": "https://images.genius.com/627acab300f5f3fd378a3b1adf4a69f8.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "N.W.A"}
