Romil)\n\n[Verse]\n15 weapons\nI can change your life in 15 seconds\nI was 15 when I realized the damage\nI was 16 when I moved to Atlanta\nMetro, my view is foggy still\nVomit on the ground yelling out to my mommy still\nWill daddy?\nIs daddy here ever?\nAnd the holes inside my skin don\u2019t make me feel no better\nFake leather that them niggas sold back at home in Corpus\nThe crib we had on Brockhampton made all us feel enormous\nI feel closed in and boxed in now\nNo disrespect to my sister, but I need to get out\nLemme light that cigarette now, watch me not put it to my mouth\nBut watch it die though, just like all of us\nWe all gon' die slow, phone home to Ohio\nIs Scott here?\nI think that Scott here cause he the only that seem to care about us\n\"Where the love at? Where the trust at?\"\nUsed iMessage to send my main bitch that, she still ain't hit me back\nI'mma pretend this gat is the place I\u2019m supposed to lay my head at\nLemme take this nap\n\n[Bridge]\nIf you want me dead, gon' head and shoot me down\nIf you want me dead, gon' head and kill me now\nAnd I\u2019ve been dead\nI\u2019ve seen so many legs, arms, tear apart\nHow did this start?\nHow did this start?\nHow did this start?\nHow did this start?\n\n[Outro]\nYou think it\u2019s wrong for me to die?\nShit, I\u2019ve been dead my whole life\nI'm still searching for what\u2019s right\nBut we all know I ain\u2019t right\nGotta stay focused, aye\n(You can cut it now.)"}], "artist": "Kevin Abstract"}
