Does it really really matter when you're entering a hearse?\nLook, I'm alone in a coma from the methadone searching for a saint that was frozen in a bed of snow\nAnd then I'll excavate the set of bones, easy come, easy go, better late than never though\nHere we go again, we can call it my defeat when my tongue is in my cheek for a solid ninety weeks\nSwallow pride and grief, that is all I really had, just so I can understand that is all that I can be\nAnd from a birdseye view, sixteen shots and I'll earn my dues\nSixteen shots and the world I knew is a resting plot for the kerbside blues\nI see a city trapped in amber full of all the joy and the misery that's captured\nBright lights emitting in a pattern by the fireflies like a symphony of lanterns", "album": "Flowers For My Father"}], "artist": "Sadistik"}
