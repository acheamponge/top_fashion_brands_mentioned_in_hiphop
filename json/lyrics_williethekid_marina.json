You should be, behold the horror\nMy flow water, rap wise, I'm like, penny wise, copper foamposites\nPenny, Penny's\nNever penny pinch, paid a pretty penny for the image\nNot a blemish, epitome, my kindred spirit\nDrinkin' spirits, drive German cars, I'm driven\nPick 'em like geraniums, germane to every issue that I've been in\n\n[Verse 2: Jon Connor]\nSo here's another miracle as I live out Jesus's parables\nLife is funny, hysterical\nThey say it's lonely at the top\nCompared the air up here is unbearable, make it hard to breathe\nTrapped in our dreams, so it seems, it make it hard to leave\nShackled to my own thoughts so every track's an onslaught\nThat'll one day set me free and leave me where I need to be\nThat be that optimistic airy shit, scary shit\nThe same hard-headed way a thinkin' that'd be the one that I get buried with\nCity on my back, the only one strong enough to carry it\nCity where death is comin', now look how close the cemetery is\nWe don't wanna make waves or end up where they make graves\nA mentality we can't change so we just try to maintain\nBy maintain, that just means we all remain tame\nThe world is crazy and the goal is to remain sane\nDon't think outside the box, they want us to remain plain\nThey ain't gon' be happy til we all sharin' the same brain\nCollege is artificial, knowledge used for profit\nTo fatten the institutions while all we still end up jobless\nThat's how they got us, like milk and honey was promised\nWith a degree you ain't shit, and you really ain't shit without it\nLook, not to offend anyone who didn't turn the tassel\nBut I grew up in a home where them loans turned to a hassle\nBefore the debt is gone they want to go on and get their Master's\nIt's a distraction\nCause life's not a job, it's what you should master\nWho do we follow if not ourselves?\nDo we not ourself?\nAt a nine-to-five workin' to make wealth for somebody else\nNo matter what I been through, I'm a continue\nCause when shit gets deep I gotta swim too", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c94ff25ab4cf1a28f6920d0faa95b9cc.500x500x1.jpg", "album": "Aquamarine", "title": "Marina"}]}
