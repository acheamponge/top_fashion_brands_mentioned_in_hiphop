By the time you hear this I'll\nBe long gone with a smile\nSo fuck you and your style\nGet in these kicks and walk these miles\nDon't hit no wall, life is a constant squall\nNuclear firearms, everytime I'm in those arms blast\nWhen I raise my glass, toast my future, present, past\nInside I hope it last, at least 'til this hangover pass\nBombs over Baghdad, between have nots and must haves\nMe on both sides, I keep tabs, in case it's over soon\nTick-tock, goes the box\nWatch 'em go nuts and attempts to make it stop\nBut they can't, never learned to pick no locks\nWatch, right from the sides, as they all suicide\nAs they all drink the Kool-Aid I observe and then drink mine\n\n[Bridge: Wrekonize]\nDo what I do with one foot in the grave\nSmile up on my face like everything's okay\nEverytime I go I wonder if I should stay (Sta-a-a-a-ay)\nNot today, one foot in the grave\n\n[Hook] (2X)", "title": "One Foot in the Grave", "year": null, "album": "A Soiree For Skeptics", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d23b689edc521146ac84672312449010.700x700x1.jpg"}]}
