{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1: Jay-Z]\nUh, yo don't get mad at me\nI don't love 'em, I fuck 'em\nI don't chase 'em, I duck 'em\nI replace 'em with another one\nYou had to see she keep calling me B.I.G\nAnd my name is Jay-Z\nShe be all on my dick\nGradually I'm taking over your bitch\nComing over your shit\nGot my feet up on you sofa, man\nI eat a hostess from my open hand\nYou coming home to dishes and empty soda cans\nI got your bitch in my Rover man\nI never kiss her, I never hold her hand\nIn fact I diss her I'm a bolder man\nI'ma pimp her, it's over man\n(It's over man, it's over man...)\n\n[Chorus: Missy Elliott]\nOh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six?\nWith her hand on his dick keep licking her lips\nIs that your bitch? Why she all in his ride?\nWith her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes\nOh, is that your bitch? You better tell her chill\nWhile you all in his grill, don't you know that man kill?\nIs that your bitch? Why she paging him?\nKeep praising him? 'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch!\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nYo, yo, why you home alone, why she out with me?\nRoom 112, hotel balcony\nHow she say Jay you can call the house for me?\nThere's no respect at all\nYou betta check her dawg\nShe keep beggin' me to hit it raw\nSo she can have my kids and say it was yours\nHow foul is she? And you wifed her\nShit, I put the rubber on tighter\nSent her home, when she entered home\nYou hugged her up\nWhat the fuck is up?\nShe got you whipped, got your kids\nGot your home, but that's not your bitch\nYou share that girl, don't let 'em hear that he'll hurl\nIt'll make 'em sick that his favorite chick\nAin't saving it, unfaithful bitch\n\n[Chorus: Missy Elliott]\nOh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six?\nWith her hand on his dick keep licking her lips\nIs that your bitch? Why she all in his ride?\nWith her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes\nOh, is that your bitch? You better tell her chill\nWhile you all in his grill, don't you know that man kill?\nIs that your bitch? Why she paging him?\nKeep praising him? 'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch!\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nCool out homie\nYou betta keep her away from my balling clique\nKeep her out of nightclubs all in the mix\nFrom hanging out with chicks who be swallowing dicks\nFrom cats who order Cris' play the floor with the Knicks\nIt can only lead to something unfortunate\nHot boy like Jigga Man scorch your bitch\nPlay the four dot, Jigga Man go first\nThen we all rock 'til we all hot\nYou know the boy from the Roc got them whores on lock\nGot the bitches in the smash\nMake them drawers drop fast\n'Cause we get more cash than the average nigga?\nAll them hoes like \"Damn, I gotta have this nigga\"\n'Cause I'ma hot black, how in the hell can you stop that?\nYou would fuck mine\nHow the hell can you knock that?\nI'm just playing the cards choosenly\nJigga Man, who you supposed to be?\n\n[Chorus: Missy Elliott]\nOh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six?\nWith her hand on his dick keep licking her lips\nIs that your bitch? Why she all in his ride?\nWith her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes\nOh, is that your bitch? You better tell her chill\nWhile you all in his grill, don't you know that man kill?\nIs that your bitch? Why she paging him?\nKeep praising him? 'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch!\n\n[Verse 4: Twista]\nTha Jigga and Twista got 'em screaming\nLike a demon fiending for the semen\nChrome gleaming like the dome off Keenan\nGone while I'm leanin' smoking\nI'm whip it in the stomach\nYour bitch on the passenger side of me flashing your money\nWhy you acting so funny?\nYou know she been flirting while your working\nBehind the curtain knuckles jerking for certain\nPoppin' that pussy\nSweatin' till no fluid is left\nWhen I come in the party with J we gonna do it to death\nYou gon' ruin your rep\nTrippin' while we pimpin' these hefers\nPlaya lectures got me shining like a new Gator stepper\nMust have been mad\nWhen your ho put my stuff in the dash\nBust in her ass\nTo climax I come up with a nab\nThe game don't stop\nLegit ballers bending up the block\nNiggas rushing, coming at us cause of status and props\nSucking and fucking, loving it when I put the dick up inside her\nCan't help it if she's in love with a rider\n\n[Bridge: Missy Elliott]\nOh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six?\nWith her hand on his dick keep licking her lips\nIs that your bitch? Why she all in his ride?\nWith her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes\nOh, is that your bitch?
