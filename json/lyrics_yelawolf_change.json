I'm in Alabama chillin'\nAnd I just took a shot for the ones who stop when they hit the ceilin'\nDrop the top on the 65 in Nash, I can still hear em, they're saying\n\n[Hook 2]\n(Where will you go now? What will they say?)\nI done found my soul through change\n(Is it true now, or just play?)\nI done found my soul through change\n(Where will you go now, don't turn around)\n\n[Outro]\nDo not succumb to the masses ideas\nOver ridicule and judgement\nFor those who follow the ideas of the weak\nWill perish in a dim fog of enlightenment\nBecome the vision of the mind's eye\nAnd carry your flame to the fire\nDo not wait for the fire to carry the flame to you\nBuild, work, build, work, build, work\nFall down, fail, learn, learn, earn, earn and conquer\nMoney is a tool for the creation of a creative space\nDo not squander the value of a gift from a friend\nFamily, strangers, enemies, atheists, partisans, pedlers, people\nPeople in this ocean of hungry minds\nFeed, do not starve\nStart now, wake up\nA trillion more lives will live happy before one of those trillion care or not about your happiness\nLove yourself and hate only you\nIf you don't...", "title": "Change"}]}
