'Cause God's watchin'\nSatan is takin' my sanity please God stop it\nI'm feelin' like Snoop 'cause murder was the case that they gave me\nThey knew I ain't do it, but just to they permission they wanna hang me\nI'm feelin' like Jesus when he was about to be crucified\nPlease everyone if you don't help me then you could die\nSuicide is safety, but it's definite hell\nSomebody dead & they got me stressin' in hell\nI'm sangin' the blues\n\n[Chorus: Z-Ro]\nEveryday I'm still goin' through the Samethang\nI'm tryin' so hard just to maintain\nAll I ever wanted was just to make a lil' change\nI'm real but niggas still talk down on my name\nEveryday I'm still goin' through the Samethang\nI'm tryin' so hard just to maintain\nAll I ever wanted was to be in the rap game\n'Cause my people step on me like I'm a flow mad fame\n\n[Z-Ro:]\nI'm used to mother organizations & 'loc's of my own\nEvaporate like Brillo when fiends smokin' that stones\nThat's the way we live in the ghetto, if we could we'd change\nBut don't nobody love us but trouble, so that's why we bang\nMany funerals to go to, I don't go to none\nNever look in a pine box until I see Z-Ro in one\nAin't no future in front & I'm scared to be decease\nBut it seems like the only way a gorilla-mobb gangsta gon' see peace\n'Cause mama waitin' for me, her & Grandma Bezzy\nTellin' me ain't no haters in Heaven or detectives to sweat me\nBut a mansion a home in the ground, that'll be mine\nHand ready singin' praises to God, that'll be fine\nPlus they tell me the streets are made of gold\nHere people murder people, the webbin' in Heaven is under your toes\nIt ain't hard doin' right, it's just hard to succeed\nI wanna live but it's hard to breathe\nIt got me singin' the blues\n\n[Chorus: Z-Ro]\nEveryday I'm still goin' through the Samethang\nI'm tryin' so hard just to maintain\nAll I ever wanted was just to make a lil' change\nI'm real but niggas still talk down on my name\nEveryday I'm still goin' through the Samethang\nI'm tryin' so hard just to maintain\nAll I ever wanted was to be in the rap game\n'Cause my people step on me like I'm a flow mad fame\n\n[Z-Ro:]\nI done came along way, but it's still alot of road up ahead\nTo be honest I be feelin' like I'm about to be dead\nPeople feel as if I'm suppose be happy 'cause I'm makin' some ends\nBut I'm lonely 'cause I cannot communicate with my friends\nNiggas I grew up with, be actin' like we ain't grow up together\nFuck hoes & pour up together\nNigga you cried on my shoulders & I cried on yours\nYeah you rode on my enemies, so I ride on yours\nBut it's a different day & time\nAnd we don't even kick it\nAin't nobody got time to holla no more it's strictly business\nBut I tell you this, I will always have love for ya\nThe same nigga bitch I still shed blood for ya\nThe same nigga blood bitch I love ya\nI went to school to fight niggas for you\nEven though we wasn't Blood Brothers\nFuck that, we was brothers\nWhat we is now?\nI can't do nothin' but continue my years out\nBut it's all gravy, ain't nobody gotta chill with me\nOnly thing I ask nigga keep it real with me\n\n[Chorus: Z-Ro]\nEveryday I'm still goin' through the Samethang\nI'm tryin' so hard just to maintain\nAll I ever wanted was just to make a lil' change\nI'm real but niggas still talk down on my name\nEveryday I'm still goin' through the Samethang\nI'm tryin' so hard just to maintain\nAll I ever wanted was to be in the rap game\n'Cause my people step on me like I'm a flow mad fame", "year": null, "image": "https://images.genius.com/edace8572541436d07b681483f804163.500x500x1.jpg"}]}
