William cutting, check it\n\nThere's three stages of Free Masons\nGreen papers written in diseased hatred\nBe patient, wait for the egyptian translation\nDavid and Goliath at war, achieve greatness\nSeen agents with biological agents in briefcases\nHoly shit homie, this ain't what the prophecies of the Bible said\nLeviathan, a cross between lucifer and a scientist\nSitting in a pentagram, octagon\nReading from the necronomicon with octomom\n?fuck the fembot that shot Oscar Goldman\nMy operation costs six billion\nGoddamnit you should've told them who I am\nIll Bill, goonsday, it's doomsday\nThe Forty-deuce black hebrew goonface, my tool spray\nIt takes forty-two muscles to frown\nAnd only four to click the trigger of a four-pound\nI'm falling down\nMy bullets'll melt your face like the end of Raiders\nPop your fucking cranium open like a baked potato", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8ada7e190ceb4cd543137da9736ec2ae.640x640x1.jpg", "album": "Howie Made Me Do It 3", "year": "2013-11-26"}]}
