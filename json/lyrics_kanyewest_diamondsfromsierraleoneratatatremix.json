Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......\nClose your eyes and imagine, feel the magic\nVegas on acid\nSeen through Yves St. Laurent glasses\nAnd I've realized that I've arrived, cuz\nIt take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does\nHe write his own rhymes, so sort of\nI think 'em\nThat mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up\nDamn, is he really that caught up?\nI ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?\nI remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder\nSo its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche\n- its for yourself that's important\nIf a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men\nThen your fat friend her nickname is Minivan\nExcuse me\nThat's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because\n\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever)\nThrow your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)\nThe Roc is still alive every time I rhyme\nForever ever?
