{"songs": [{"lyrics": "[Verse 1: Action Bronson]\nAs I step in the door, you in your bathrobe\nPour you a little more wine, I see your glass low\nScared of a real man, from dealing with these assholes\nJust drink ya wine and then will step up in the bath, slow\nSoak your body, cause its begging for a loving touch\nLight the candle, and ima light another Dutch\nThen we slip into a place that's only you & me\nPut it deep, like the bottom of the bluest sea\nYou too young to be locked down, truancy\nAlways got ya hair down, rockin your jewelry\nKilling these other bitches, word, reading their eulogy'\nHips insane\nThe pussy? Foolery\nAt the end of the day baby it's you & me\nAt the end of the day honey it's you & me\nJust you & me", "title": "Forbidden Fruit", "album": "Dr. Lecter", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9b10376fe5cc5f697702488523dba2cd.580x521x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Action Bronson"}
