Quit harrassin'!\nToo paranoid to pick up the phone\nHome alone all day dustin' off the chrome!\nWhat am I supposed to do?\nWhen everytime I turn around I got to deal with fools\nIt's like I gotta bend all the rules\nTo try to take what's mine even if I lose\nWhy you never make it to work on time?\n(I can't help it!)\nWhy you smoke all the weed if you knew it was mine?\n(I can't help it!)\nWhy you always start shit right before you leave?\n(I can't help it!)\nI guess fuckin' up comes naturally?\nNaturally, naturally\n\n[Hook]\nWhat's with the self-inflicted pain?\n(I can't help it!)\nHow come everytime I see you around you act strange?\n(I can't help it!)\nWhy do you trip at the sight of a hater?\n(I can't help it!)\nAnd then slit they throat with a rusty ass razor?\n(I can't help it!)\n\n[Break] -x2\nIt's ain't my fault that I was raised this way\nNever meant to cause you pain\nOnly thing that I could say is\nI apologize!!!", "year": "2004-07-27"}]}
