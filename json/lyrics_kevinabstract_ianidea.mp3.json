And I feel like Saturation 1, 2 and 3 was my moment of catching magic and also my rise to stardom. And whatever happened to Lauryn Hill after Miseducation put her in a place where she no longer wanted to make music or felt comfort --  not, not make -- sh -- she no longer wanted to release music, right, kinda, kinda like, sent her to hell in a way. And ev-everything after Saturation 3 has been my Lauryn Hill moment, except I am now, you know, obligated to release these mu-- these, these albums and these songs, so I feel like I\u2019m currently writing music and songs and albums from hell. And I have to put these songs out into the world because I'm obligated to, not because it's coming from a place of joy. And that, that is going to cause for messy albums, unfinished thoughts, unpolished thoughts and I just want to manage my expectations in terms of fame and stardom -- this whole idea of Michael Jackson, that I\u2019ve been attracted to since I was a child, in terms of fame -- is totally dead and unattainable. I could become way more famous, but I'll never reach that level of hysteria that he was at. Um, and like Pitchfork just said about me: I want to be Paramount, but I'm way more like A24. I'm, I'm, I will never reach that level, it's just, it's dead, I don't think anyone will reach that level."}], "artist": "Kevin Abstract"}
