Anything's possible\nYou just might make a friend\nSo when they try to make you cry\nTell them again and again\nSay it like this-\n\n[Hook x3]\nI'm beautiful and spiritual\nAnd I think it's about time to tell you this\nI'm gonna be the best me\nThat I know how to be\n\n\nSay it again my brother- I'm beautiful\nAnd I'm special and I think it's about time\nTo tell you this. I'm gonna be the best me\nThat I know how to be\n\nSay, I'm beautiful and special\nAnd I think it's about time to tell you this\nI'm gonna be the best me\nThat I know how to be", "title": "I\u2019m Beautiful", "album": "Shine Through"}], "artist": "Aloe Blacc"}
