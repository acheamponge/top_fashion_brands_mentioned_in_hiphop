You're the only one in heaven\nProbably slick enough to pull off stealing God's wallet\nIn life the Lord ain't really deal you a fair one\nI watched you bury your baby boy, your daughter and your grandson\nYou lived one hell of a life from being highly decorated\nTo being homeless sleeping in the park with your pregnant wife\nIf I acted up in the restaurant I knew I was being brave\nCause you'd take me to the bathroom and spank me till I knew how to behave\nTaught me prayers at night and you'd tell me Bible stories\nTaught me history, Crazy Horse and his tribal glories\nHow many times as a kid I seen you handcuffed by the cops?\nYou taught us black music, Sam Cooke, The Drifters, The Four Tops\nTaught me about boxing, Ray Leonard and Larry Holmes\nAround the same time you left my mother for Debbie Jones\nI told the world your true story and after the record got made\nUncommon Valor, some said I dropped the verse of the decade\nEverywhere you went you would tell the world about your son Rugged Man\nYou was so proud of me, daddy, you was my number one fan\nYou was always bragging about me to no purpose\nOn your deathbed you'd play my Mayweather interview for the nurses\nLosing you, daddy, it hurt more than any physical pain\nYou was too young when the cancer went from your throat and into your brain\nYou was my teacher, my idol, I worshipped you, you was the best, daddy\nYou lived a tough life, now get some rest, daddy\nI love you daddy\n\n[Chorus]\nI can see your halo, halo, halo\nI can see your halo, halo, ha-ha-ha-ha\nHalo, halo, halo\nI can see your halo, halo\nHalo\nI can see your halo, halo, ha-ha-ha-ha\nHalo, halo, halo\nI can see your halo, halo", "title": "Legends Never Die (Daddy\u2019s Halo)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c839ae29cd32413eb20a1c6585d7d604.1000x1000x1.jpg"}]}
