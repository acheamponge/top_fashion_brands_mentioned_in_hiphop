Yes\nThere's been thirty five lynchings this year alone\nDepression got people starvin' all over the country\nScottsboro Boys in the jail for a crime they didn't commit\nAll of that is wrong\nFrancine Hughes: Yeah, I understand all that\nBumpy Johnson: But?\nFrancine Hughes: But I don't understand you\nYou're a perfect gentleman, you're a poet\nYou're nice to people, you-you think about things\nAnd then, within a blink of an eye, you can kill or be killed\nBumpy Johnson: Is there nothing in this world that you love enough, that you would kill for it or die for it?\n\n[Verse 1: Prodigy]\nYeah\nWhen darkness consumes the neighborhood streets\nThe neighborhood hoods and the neighborhood creeps\nCome out to play with they hats pulled down\nAnd their hoodies pulled low below they eyebrows\nTake yo ass in the crib you not down for madness\n'Bout to go down three at night\nNight shift workers come home they walk fast\nScared to go through they own block, yeah, it's that bad\nThe villains making a killin' sellin' pieces of weight\nE&J inside a hot chamomile tea\nKeep em warm 'cause the cold air'll cut your skin\nIt's bleedin' outside but the block still clickin'\nThere's cameras in the hood but the fiends still smoke\nThe narcs makin' movies\nThey lookin' for the role of the worlds dumbest criminal caught on film while the real criminal minds continue to thrive in\n\n[Chorus: Prodigy]\nThe hood in the twilight you hear guns bark\nStreet lamps gettin' shot out to keep the block dark\nWe post up in the blackness of the shadows\nWhere only crackheads and dope fiends dare travel\nWhere police enter at they own risk\nIf you not from this hood get yo ass out the bricks\nMost bodies get caught at night\nYou'll be chokin' on blood starin' up at the stars in the twilight\n\n[Verse 2: Prodigy]\nIt's 2012 and drugs still movin'\nThe balance don't stop and the prisons is full with scar-faced thugs\nC's and B's, who do years and come back to the same routine\nSome say the game over, they must be blind\nBet they don't come through the real hoods at night\nWith that theoretical shit, you shit your drawers\nYou'll get robbed for your outfit, yeah, take that off\nDisparity rules the world, the rich is outnumbered\nYou can't straddle the fence, pick a side, fucker\nYou got 'til the sun go down 'cause when that full moon rise then the wolves come out\nAnd the cocaine vampires slingin' hard white from dusk to dawn\nIt's nothin' like the movies\nWe drink holy water, rock crucifixes, and eat garlic and onion chips for dinner\n\n[Chorus: Prodigy]\nThe hood in the twilight you hear guns bark\nStreet lamps gettin' shot out to keep the block dark\nWe post up in the blackness of the shadows\nWhere only crackheads and dope fiends dare travel\nWhere police enter at they own risk\nIf you not from this hood get yo ass out the bricks\nMost bodies get caught at night\nYou'll be chokin' on blood starin' up at the stars in the twilight\n\n[Verse 3: Havoc]\nYeah and this is right up my alley, P\nLikewise, won't let a nigga straddle me\nPull up the cavalry, the salary is runnin' low\n[?] at his throat, now tell me what I wanna know\nI need addresses, how to access it\nYou know it's somethin' if you got that nigga Hav stressin'\nYour mans know I got him stockin' up on mad vestes\nI been down this road so this my last ditch effort\nNo homo, everybody get naked\nPlay hero, I spin you like a hit record\nMy goons bipolar, eyes over shoulder, and, how ironic, more gruesome when I'm sober\nNocturnal, won't rest 'til I learn you\nTaste pussy, got a bitch in your guy circle\nI send shots at your cop Colonel\nTalkin' all that fly shit that's what it'll earn you\n\n[Chorus: Prodigy]\nThe hood in the twilight you hear guns bark\nStreet lamps gettin' shot out to keep the block dark\nWe post up in the blackness of the shadows\nWhere only crackheads and dope fiends dare travel\nWhere police enter at they own risk\nIf you not from this hood get yo ass out the bricks\nMost bodies get caught at night\nYou'll be chokin' on blood starin' up at the stars in the twilight", "year": "2011-04-19"}]}
