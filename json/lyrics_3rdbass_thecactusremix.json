Do you get the picture?\nDo you understand where i'm placing you in\nThe position of the torso?\nIt's a little low, around the midsection, cool\nYou gettin' it? You get the picture?\nI see you gettin' heated, let me bring another lyric to you\n\n[Verse 3: MC Serch]\nThe smart villain, chillin' like Gilligan\nOut on an island\nFishin' with my string and bamboo\nCaught somethin' in a see thru nighty\nMight be a little tasty\nA 300 pound white girl\nNo one to see this, boom, I dropped my fluid like a chemist\nShe's contained and I'm a lame brain\nBut doing the wild thing\nKicked the fat thing off of my swing\nLarger than Jim Backus\nIt's the cactus\n\n[Bridge: Pete Nice]\nThere it is, hey young ladies\nKeep bouncin', bouncin' the cactus\nThe cactus, it's time to ground and feel\nThe cactus, Pete Nice delivers the cactus\n\n[Verse 4: Pete Nice]\nNo boots your money spent\nLast call for toxicants\nOne move to reach a throttle\nEyesight is through a goggle\nI trips to the hype type\nGood-lookin' in the dark light\nIt's appetizing to conversate\nTo a fossil pushing 58\nAll bags and her butt sags\nIn the desert no price tag\nA household tool and a stank ho\nThe cactus turned Hammer's mother out\n\n[Outro: Pete Nice]\nThere it is, RIF Productions has brought forth the cactus\nForget what you have heard, forget what you might have seen\n'Cause this is the new thing to swing upon in 80-deca\nSam Sever got the cactus\nPete Nice got the cactus\nTayshaun got the cactus\nMC Serch got the cactus\nRussell Simmons got the cactus\nKMD got the cactus\nDoom and Heim got the cactus\nAhmed and Otis got the cactus\nBig Craig got a BIG ol' cactus!\nRush got the cactus\nDante, he got a little itty bitty baby cactus!\n...but he can still use it, ha ha ha haaa! See ya!\nYo, we're Professor Griff, that means we're outta here, sucka\nEy Don Bluey, wheres my cactus?\nYo, you ain't got no cactus\nDeshaun, wheres my cactus?\nNo food for you Deshaun, until you find my cactus", "image": "https://images.genius.com/66b094b3f4ff3a3de57feb7e3b9816d8.300x300x1.jpg", "album": "The Cactus Revisited", "title": "The Cactus (Remix)", "year": "1990-09-07"}]}
