There's five of you, but hundreds of us\nAnd here you stand, empty handed\nBesides a duffel of guns, hand 'em over\nWe don't use these in the jungle\nThey're for false gods and wannabe conquerors\nWe seen your kind before, funny beige hats and mustaches\nPop said never trust a savage with a satellite and hundreds of cameras\nI put a apple in they mouth and roast 'em\nI like to toast 'em with a marshmallow stuffed up they asshole\nAnd hopefully amongst their bitches there's a virgin for the sacrifice\n\n[Verse 2]\nCannibal voodoo leave you murdered in the afterlife\nDance with umfufu, dinner served lit by candlelight\nKill, eat, fuck, is the law; no murder charge\nYou and your squad turned to burgers and kebabs\nCook you impaled on the sharpest of knives\nThe length of my speer's like a machete got stuck up your arse\nStill half alive, staring up at the stars\nMy favorite medium rare, center cut is the bomb", "image": "https://images.genius.com/228d2ebd2bcc82b1b531ca58db70a36c.600x600x1.jpg", "album": "SEPTAGRAM", "year": "2016-06-10"}]}
