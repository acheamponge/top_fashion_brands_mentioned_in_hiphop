Let's get it crackin' baby\nThey on the set, double takin' like I'm actin' baby\nI'm brand new, brand new, but some will swear I'm fakin'\nBut I ain't trippin', I ain't trippin', I just let 'em make it\nThe proof I'm actin' different, not a fool but I get in it\nNot the root but I can dig it, see the truth I'm a Christian\nAnd that's what happens when Jesus steps on the scene\nSo fresh so clean, all my saints know what I mean\n(Actin' brand new) not tryna run from actin' illing\nNew like a fresh fit or shopping tag, pop it like a willie\nAy, this is somethin' special in the making, you can feel it\nThis is more than just some music, it's a movement, can't conceal it\nNew walk, new talk, all my boys say you wilin' homie\nDude dropped a couple pounds, now you think you stylin' homie\nNah bro, only lies wear a disguise\nThat ain't me, that ain't me, you can miss me like goodbye\nYou know I'm \u2026\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nWent from livin' for myself and hatin', livin' for the King\nWent from chasin' after wealth to satisfied in Elohim\nNo more runnin' after women, snatchin' wives with good intentions\nI got out the maze, thank you Beverly, happy feelings\nOne life, one wife, one sight, one love\nIf you knew the old me, I'd tell you one just ain't enough\nBut the old is passed away, even though I'm still breathin'\nTake both, fast and pray, lookin' for the day I see him\nAnd I'm (actin' brand new) because he's where my hope lies\nNot in me, not in man, cause even the pope dies\nSee we all born lost and man we never find direction\nYou can trust we never will man without divine election\nAy I'm actin' brand new 'cause he made me brand new\nYou don't understand me then you don't understand truth\nIn him, my life is not my own and by faith gone\nAnd this brand new livin' is found in Christ alone\nYou know I'm \u2026\n\n[Hook] (x2)"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
