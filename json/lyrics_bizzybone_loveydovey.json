Well fuck it, I'm finna share love\n\n(Chorus)\n(Bizzy Bone)\nRollin in a hoopty or a bucket, who gives a fuck\nListin to slow cuts, smokin weed, so what\nAnd held up, I'm in a hold-up, Bizzy baby don't fold up\nAnd this is ain't the way it's supposed to be, I'm tellin ya, I told ya\nSoldier, grown men callin theyself Jehovah\nI only hope when they get judged that they was representin Jehovah\nNo adultery don't ever roll over\nFeelin the pain of a spiritual warrior wanted a platform to warn ya\nBeen scorned, ever since I was born, \"America's Most Wanted\"\nJohn Walsh family in a trailer park in Oklahoma\nYou want it? Yes I'm on it, B we on it fo' sho'\n'Member you want it you go get it, I'm wit it, admit it you know (yeah)\nHa (for the utmost) for the utmost baby, fo' sho' the tongue's wicked\nPay attention to the water and the way that we kick it\nPray over the food (over the food) bless this meal\nBow down and kneel, and we never accept the seal\nOr the number of the beast, I serve God, not mammy\nLet me give you knowledge (one time for they mind) let me stop my ramblin\nOr the number of the beast, I serve God, not mammy\nInstead of me givin you extra knowledge, let me stop my ramblin\nOne time\n\n(Chorus)\n(Bizzy Bone)\nOn that tropical, logical thinkin, E's an impossible\nProbable, beer in the bottle, I'm full throttle\nUnstoppble, jealousies make 'em envy my words\nSo they can think of somethin heinous to do, when I'm on the curve\nSmoke herb with my closest family members and friends\nBend corners in the Lambo while I'm stackin them ends\nOne for the dub and the real, together always\nAnd if the end of the world comes and we call V\nSee the Lord'll save his children, I love him, may I exalt him\nAbove the heavens and the Earth the creator is L's calling\nUltra (Alpha and Omega), the father Jesus Christ\nMy everything I love you, you so right\nExpressions of my heart, it gets painful to think\nBaby why do you think - that I drink, that I drink, that I drink\nAnything that you need if it's possible, I'll supply\nI can help but I'm emotional and that's why I cry\nOne time\n\n(Chorus)"}], "artist": "Bizzy Bone"}
