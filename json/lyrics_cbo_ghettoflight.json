I feel a burnin' sensation and I'm waitin'\nFor the pain to go away but I know it's gonna stay\nSo I guess I'm fucked in the game\nThen appeared a bird in the sky, don't know from where it came\nSnatched the P-I double Z-O quick, took me on the trip\nDon't know which direction I went\nIt felt I went cross the continent\nSeems like it took a whole day, then we touched down\nWhite coats all around, suprise, I'm alive in a hospital\nDone lost half of my soul, I feel out of control\nI'm slippin' away, I took my life for granted\nA few hours passed and I still feel stranded\nI awaken to see shit in front of me that I never seen before\nBut I feel alright, then I tripped that I just took the ghetto flight\n\nOne-eight-seven, one-eight-seven...\nThey ridin' on my bumber, bustin' with a Mac-11...\nOne-eight-seven, one-eight-seven...\nThey ridin' on my bumber, bustin' with a Mac-11...\nOne-eight-seven, one-eight-seven...\nThey ridin' on my bumber, bustin' with a Mac-11...\n\n[C-Bo]\nMy homie took a bullet in the kidney\nHK in my hand, down on one knee\nOn his side, Q-Ball don't die\nMad as fuck and I don't understand why\nThe little B.G.'s didn't bust no caps\nAfter a 5 minute shoot-out still had a loaded strap\nDamn and they supposed to be hardcore bangers\nAnd I got the only empty cocked back chamber\nPrayin' for my homie not to rest in peace the shit\nJust ain't right to take a life from an O.G\nRetaliation is all I can think\nNegative and corrupt, here comes the P.D\nDamn, I gotta git and my homie don't look too good\nI hear the bird over the hood\nNow I got faith he'll make it\nWithout a doubt and if not this next album's dedicated\nTo my homie Q-Ball\nRest in peace and fuck the rest of ya'll\nSo-called homies, I don't the meanin' when I'm hittin' ya down\nBut when I'm gone ya wanna see me\nAin't no love in this Garden Blocc life\nAnd I won't sweat to put a bullet in your chest\nAnd have you next on the ghetto fligt..."}]}
