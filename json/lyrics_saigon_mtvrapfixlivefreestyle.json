Cause I'm dumb smart\nRappers ain't really a match for this\nI guzzle a fifth of Matheson's\nThen say the alphabet backwards afterwards\nThe day you see a dead (nigga) just hop out of his coffin\nThe day you see me beefing, I blow it out of proportion\nThis from New York to Boston, Dallas to Austin\nIf you married the streets, don't plan to file for divorce then", "album": null}], "artist": "Saigon"}
