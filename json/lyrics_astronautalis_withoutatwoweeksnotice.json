they leave me in the place\nAnd they lock the front door, leave me alone\nThey don't trust me, think I'll steal stuff and go\nBut I don't really have any interest in owning this crap\nI just want my wage and I'll leave it at that\nSo I say thanks as they lock me on in\nMy first day on the job without any friends\nAnd they gave me my instructions and my little coat\nMy uniform, my back brace and that's all she wrote\n\nSo I do my damn job and keep my nose clean\nLift box A and take it to rack B\nI walk around all day counting the seconds\nHeadphones on, singing to the walls just reckless\nIt's funny how you're in a big building alone\nYou start talking to the place like it's someone you know\nAnd you tell it all the things that are buzzin' in your brain\nThat been burning in the back of your head all damn day\nLittle secrets and lies, jokes and notes\nLittle observations that you tell no one you know\nYou wouldn't even whisper these things to the mirror\nOr talk to your dog or couch and make your observations clearer\nYou just keep 'em locked up in your heart\n'Till you get this big room to tear you apart\n\nAs you stare at the smooth grey walls\nYou see lines and chips and patterns that form\nAt first it's little geometric shapes\nYour little notes, scraps, receipts - patterns displayed\nLike constellations hidden inside the stars\nStart tracing lines and find faces\nThen those faces become more detailed\nTakes on the shapes of males and females\nYou see hands, fingertips, lines and moustaches\nLittle thoughts, dreams and bus passes\nThese little shapes and lines take their own\nThey start to have lives, kids, wives and homes\nAnd you look close you see little details\nThe little sins, the little female\nThoughts, traits, whispers and dreams\nAnd all of a sudden it starts to tear at the seams\nBecause at first when you look into the suburbs\nYou see beautiful faces then get to the curb\nYou see bits of trash and cigarette butts\nThat a mother threw out before her kids got touched\nBy the fact the their mom really smoked\nFor the last thirty years but hid it in the closet, yo\nBehind the socks, behind the sweaters\nThat's where we hid all our secrets so no one knows better\n\nAnd as I look into the size of the walls\nAnd look into the ceiling, there's eyes on the floors\nI see everything, I see everyone\nI see the wedding rings, I see the stupid sons\nI see the little jokes, I see the happy smiles\nI see the fourth of Julys - the drunk kids and child\n\nHeh - I probably shouldn't look this close\n\nThe sun, it's behind her face\nYou see the little pink hairs on the side of her cheek there\nAnd at first it's romantic and attractive\nBut once you see closer it becomes unattractive\nI know it's how I think, I know it's how it falls apart\nBut everyone has a place to start\nA little puzzle piece adds up, get close now\nI'm laying in the middle of a floor of the warehouse, child\nI press my floor to the face or I guess it's the other way\nIt doesn't matter why, I can't escape\nInside this place, inside this little town\nI see the arms, the fingers - they start to move around\nNo more Norman Rockwell picturesque\nIt's a whole family, whole frame whole piece of shit\nWhole little cities start to rip apart to bits\nAnd I see it get closer and I'm falling into this\nI feel my fingers drip as I drag on the surface\nAs I move to the ocean water and trys to make perfect\nSense of everything that I know right now\nI try to pull out, withdraw, get back on track, child\nI gotta job to do - crates to lift\nAnd none of this is seemin' to start to make sense\nAll the little families and faces that I see\nMust be imagination, I'm tearing at the seams\nBut I stand here on my hands and my knees\nLookin' at this whole little civilization I see\nBuried there inside of the cement\nAs I get closer it starts to rip\n\nThe families that were once full of cheers are now\nFull of sad times, alcohol and beer\nAnd everyone's got a problem\nA dirty chair, a bad little secret, a car that won't start, dear\nThe windows are cracked and smudged - it's looking ugly\nSomeone in the neighbourhood let their lawn grow, buddy\nAnd they need to trim all the hedges on back\nTo let some sunlight in to expose the facts\nThe truth that we hide behind the doors right\nPainted bright red with the gold trim tonight\nIt's hidden there inside wrapped presents\nAnd I realise there's no escaping and I get in\nReach my fingertips into the cement\nAnd I bury myself six feet under it\nThe closer that I get, the more that I know\nThe more of the truth and the secrets are shown\nAnd every time I get my fingers inside this\nI get a little far away from what I knew\nThis job, this life, this choice\nUntil one day I've fallen entirely\nWithout a two weeks notice", "year": null}]}
