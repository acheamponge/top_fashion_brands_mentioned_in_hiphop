(What's the deal?)\nI've been peepin' your Instagram and seen that you been yourself, love\nYou just need a plan, baby (Tap in), check\nI can be your motivation, baby (Check, quit playin')\n\n[Chorus]\nThey don't make 'em like me no more, I'm real real player with it\nCount a hundred thousand, go and eat with my lady friend\nValet the whip, orange guts, this that custom shit (Off top)\nThat money just hit a little different when you thug for it\nSo long (Yeah, check)\nThat money just hit a little different when you thug for it\nI been in this game so long (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, check)\nSo long\n(I can shed a tear on this motherfuckin' beat\nIt's been a long time comin')\nI been in this game so long\n(Still got a ways to go, shit crazy, though\nCheck it out, yeah yeah, uh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI need this fish tank in my living room vibes\nYou left me at my lowest, baby, I can't even lie\nBut it's always love, you went hard for the kid\nBut whoever would've thought you'd fall in love with a trick? (Goddamn)\nCreating paradise with these flows, stay on my toes\nGoin' hard 'til a nigga get that Rolls, after that I hustle more\nThey looked down, I got stronger\nI'm a motherfuckin' beast, it ain't shit that can hold me\nOn this road by my lonely, even family turned on me\nGot this blammin' thing on me, so I wish a nigga would\nBounced out lookin' clean, make sure the 'fit good\nWith this pineapple smoothie, bitch, you know I taste good\n\n[Chorus]\nThey don't make 'em like me no more, I'm real real player with it\nCount a hundred thousand, go and eat with my lady friend\nValet the whip, orange guts, this that custom shit (Off top)\nThat money just hit a little different when you thug for it\nSo long (Yeah, check)\nThat money just hit a little different when you thug for it\nI been in this game so long (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, check)\nSo long\n(I can shed a tear on this motherfuckin' beat\nIt's been a long time comin')\nI been in this game so long\n(Still got a ways to go, shit crazy, though)"}], "artist": "Larry June"}
