{"artist": "Wrekonize", "songs": [{"lyrics": "I\u2019m out of my mind out of my tree\nOut of my lane out of my league\nOut of these words out of these beats\nOut of ideas out of these streets\nOuter lane ride outer ring reach\nOut on my vibe out on this peak\nShit I went so far out I might need ya\u2019ll to rescue me\n\nIn a world where the paper makes the profit\nAnd the profit pins the peace\nI\u2019m gonna need y\u2019all to excavate the closets\nLet\u2019s get it all out so we can see\nI never said that I thought that I was perfect\nBut I said that I could be\nIf you left me to change up the inertia\nYou might get a lesson you can teach\n\nI been falling up a bitter staircase\nTapping two left feet down\nTell me what the fuck is it I dare face\nThat could possibly take me down\nGot a heart of a lion the mind of a king\nI been saying that I\u2019m more than those\nAll that rapper talk It really don\u2019t mean a thing\nI do wanna be immortal though\nGet a grip now get a job slip\nOut the back door fuck all that shit\nI\u2019m a god how could you just give\nMe some short change and a long shift\nI been studying all of this lingo\nThat the older gods and my kinfolk\nTell me I need to know to get in those\nCircles that pay off like bingo\nBitch I been on\nIn my own way smart home all automated\nBig brother knows my whole schedule now\nTruthfully I really oughta hate it\nBut I\u2019m here now for the easy road\nPlug me in it\u2019s quite comfortable\nTo just fade through being raped you\nGot me hanging off a Cliff Huxtable\n\nSee I\u2019m Holding on for something\nI think it might be you\nEverybody want take a slice of pumpkin\nThey don\u2019t wanna pay the bill when due\nEverybody wanna stuff they face with dumplings\nAin\u2019t nobody thrilled to speak the truth\nI\u2019ll be out around the corner fist pumping\nCuz we know that justice ain\u2019t for you\n\nI been going in like entryways\nI got rent to pay so back off me if ya got probs\nI got pen for days so don\u2019t tempt the rage\nYou can\u2019t skip the fade with my god\nI been in a mental place that ain\u2019t fit to save\nIt\u2019s where the minstrel plays quite odd\nSo If you need a kid to save\nYou just missed the day\nI went Big and faked it like josh\n\nHold up\nDancing round them piano keys kick a melody like chopsticks\nActing older since seventeen that\u2019s the recipe for some boss shit\nSo the enemies tried to cut me down\nBut i\u2019m grounded more than the moss tips\nI been weapons free on a Killing spree\nFor so long I can\u2019t take a hostage no\n\n\n[Michael Melody]\nThat will also give me the chance to you know really get their attention\nBecause right now it's really difficult for me to really get their attention\nBecause one i'm having to play and sing\nAnd i'm definitely a better player than i am a singer\n\n\nI try not to be comparing every other rapper therein\nAt the moves they make I\u2019m staring\nYeah we\u2019re different that\u2019s apparent\nBut we all want the same thing\nThat respect on the name thing\nThat money ain\u2019t a thing thing\nTrying to feed my kids and do the king thing\nMost people wouldn\u2019t have an inkling\nAbout the crazy game we all playing at\nFull grind half pay on that\nFor the fool rhymes I\u2019m a maniac\nI got loose lines that could baker act y\u2019all\nBut I sympathize lock lip keep it civilized\nSometimes I just need to kill a vibe\nI know it\u2019s ill advised but\n\nI\u2019m out of my mind out of my tree\nOut of my lane out of my league\nOut of these words out of these Beats\nOut of ideas out of these streets\nOuter lane ride Outer ring reach\nOut on my vibe out on this peak\nShit I went so far out I might need ya\u2019ll to rescue me\n\nIn a world where the paper makes the profit\nAnd the profit pins the peace\nI\u2019m gonna need y\u2019all to excavate the closets\nLet\u2019s get it all out so we can see\nI never said that I thought that I was perfect\nBut I said that I could be\nIf you left me to change up the inertia\nYou might get a lesson you could teach\n\nIn a world where the paper makes the profit\nAnd the profit pins the peace\nI\u2019m gonna need y\u2019all to excavate the closets\nLet\u2019s get it all out so we can see\nI never said that I thought that I was perfect\nBut I said that I could be\nIf you left me to change up the inertia\nYou might get a lesson you could teach\n\n[Michael Melody]\nYou see that gap in there Ben?\nThere's a real swing there, yeah\nBut me and Ewan went out to do this gig one night\nAnd we got up and we said uh listen there's good new bad news\nBad news is there's only two songs\nAnd the good news you're only gonna have to clap twice\nSo this is the man for all seasons we'll see you in twenty one minutes\nThey didn't know what to make of it\nBecause we didn't stop ya know\nWe just literally like going to see the Floyd ya know\nRight through\nThat was great achievement", "title": "Manilla
