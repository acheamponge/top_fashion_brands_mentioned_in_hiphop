Reign]\nYou're watching news nigga, we did that\nFuck these new niggas, bitch we been that\nThe life you die for, we live that\nI sold my soul to the streets and I don't want it back\nCause man I just bought a chopper\nGot it stashed at my mamas\nI put the hit on your head\nAnd fly your bitch to Bahamas\nNow this the land of the free\nThe home of the brave\nNow wave your watch in the air\nIt's time to get paid\n\n[Verse 1: P. Reign]\nAlways pay day, I'll admit it\nJust got a new ho, I call her AK\nThese haters watching, till I cut off the cable\nNow all my bitches is stallions\nMy bedroom look like I stable\nLook I don't fight with no fools\nMy homies shoot when I say so\nYou niggas must have been born on like the first day of April\nPistol in the potato, I'll pop you your tomato\nAnd if she had is the molly first class down to Turks and Caicos\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: P. Reign]\nAlways pay day, I'll admit it\nVerse for the low low, no time to lay lay\nFresh off the runway, home taking off\nBought your bitch some panties, just to take 'em off\nIf your stunt its not an issue, you got my paper, got a pistol\nBaby mama wouldn't miss you, bet she kill you 'fore she kiss you\nIf you want it, big tittie doubt it take it from me\nWave your watches in the air, time is money\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: P. Reign]\nAlways pay day, I'll admit it\nTalking shit from bitch I'm ricks so fuck what they say\nIf you drink the milk, I'mma bring that cookie\nShe told me do it, just do it, I will knock you in that pussy\nI heard you a actress, well lets make a movie\nShe brought a group of bitches, now she my favorite groupie\nI tell them bitches lay there, like the choppers out\nAss up, face down, bitch gonna Pacquiao\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nAlways pay day\nAlways pay day", "year": null}]}
