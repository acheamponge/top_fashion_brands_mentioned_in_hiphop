Everest, 29,141 feet high\nWhat's the weight of the sky? The actual length and size\nAll I know is that I can't fit in it when I rhyme\nI'm about this high, use your mind for measurement\nI'm about to give you an estimate\nUse the scribes for testaments\nWhen I spit it's either a polar shift or a solar eclipse that's it\nSo when I write I breathe the breath of life into the Tree of Life\nChop meat like the Edomite\nSo raise your fist for your freedom rights\nI visit like the Rizqiyians visit Nigerians\nOr Reptilians visit Native Indians\nThe Abyssinians visit the Caribbeans\nPriest is rapping so let's visit the Millennium\nBlack Europe, I sit like Justinian\nStationary, the ability to maintain body equilibrium\n\n[Hook: Killah Priest]\nCome up to the Cosmos, enter into the divine abode\nReconnect the codes\nIn a cage that echoes from the darkest night\nThe Blackest Sun, the house is the soul\n\n[Ad-lib: Killah Priest]\nDigital Terrestrial\n\n[Outro: sample]\nCherokee 100085*00764*030*000*293*986-00"}]}
