Sometimes they will tattoo themselves.\" \"Do you have an opinion as to whether or not there are occult overtones or elements of occult involvement in these particular markers?\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nSleeping in on Saturdays\nI hang my head, I'm full of hate\nAnd you can die in many ways\nSo lay me on the interstate\nTold you once, I'll say again\nMy body's burned, I\u2019m shivering\nWon't make amends, don\u2019t need a friend\nMy blood is black, I\u2019m fucking spent\n\n[Bridge]\n\"Usually the younger the individual the more pure it is, the more powerful, the more force it has. A lot of times they will take blood and store it for other services and other use.\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nI fell away, please stay away\nIt\u2019s all in my head, can\u2019t leave my bed\nI'm sleeping all day, wasting away\nSo throw me in the reservoir\n\n[Outro]\n\"How were you accepted into involvement at Columbian Pacific universities?\" \"I had to fill out surveys of papers including all my education and background experience.\""}], "artist": "\u200bnothing,nowhere."}
