Indeed, indeed, indeed\n\n[Outro]\nSo moves like that\nThis is how we bust rhymes on a phat track\nMe and Kahlee, female refugees, we get down like that\nI don't know what to sing so my artistry brings\nThings from off the top of my head\nI bust freestyles instead\nOf memories of the time when we were free"}], "artist": "Lauryn Hill"}
