He used to push the bulletproof BM (uh huh)\nHis hair'll get you seasick; I sat back and peeped shit\nThey roll with E-Z Wider, and they ain't get blunted\nHad the whole projects working for fifty or five hundred\nWhat about bug, who trade and them niggas had cheese?\nIn the late 80s push Mercedes\nAnd Maseratis, kept reserved spaces at the horse races\nWhere they met Columbian connections like Lucho and Mariella\nThen bookoo bucks on the horses; they used to cook and flip bricks\nFaster than the jet flip flap jack and pack gats\nNiggas said Ds was dipping, burned his face with acid\n'Til this day, they would say the mothefucker's gasted\n\n[Hook]\nIt's my confession; I make corrections; I strive for perfection\nI try to be the best in, whatever I do; I'm telling you\nThis is my confession; I'm teaching niggas a lesson\nCause they can't do, what I do; here's my confession\n\n[Verse 2]\nYo, a lot of New York blocks are only bringing pennies in\nI stand beef - too many cheaps; too little fucking Indians\nToo many sips of the brew will make you do what we do\nPlay with insecurities, until we start fussing and cussing\nFrustration builds - few lose, and fist fights leave niggas busting\nNot only do we have to look out and avoid encounters with Jake\nGotta look out and avoid encounters with snakes\nNiggas who fake and play both sides of the gate\nI squeeze Boyz II Men for they cheese like Michael Bivins\nSlip with half a big nigga cap like Robert Givens\nComing up I heard sipping too much booze will leave you confused\nAnd if you watch the news, you'll see some players in this game and lose\nNiggas think they together; they ain't together at all\nStand on the block together, but divided they fall\nA lot of niggas locked down and ain't got nobody to call\nAnd a player ain't the same player when he can't ball\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, you better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me - the type that keep the bricks flipping\nJewels dripping, the margarita sipping - description\nNappy blowouts shaped up, brown-skinned\nAnd ask the hood rats about my dick; the chickens recommend it\nI make statements like \"Try me if you want\"\nPresentation: cool and calm - words as if I'm daring ya\nUsually roll with a 2 shot .25 derringer\nI'm not an actor; my life's not a movie\nI never worked with the Fugees\nI'm not killing you softly; pack a small gat just to back you up off me\nBut later when things simmer and all sin ceases\nMy peoples will see to it that you rest in peace in pieces\nKill or be killed - it's what the hood teaches\nNever go to church so the preachers can't reach us\nAnd if we do, it's only on Easter\n\n[Hook]", "year": null}]}
