(Ohhh!)\nLa la la, la-London {*2X*}\nLondon Bridge is, is falling\nLondon Bridge is falling\nAnd the Tower of Pisa is leaning\nThe Statue of Liberty is green with envy\nPenny for your thoughts, penny for your lows\nThe clothes and dress codes\nTradition of false things\nLondon Bridge is falling\nIndia's got salt on its coast\nThere's a tea party in Boston\nLondon Bridge is..\n\nMade of wood and clay, that wouldn't stay\nNo matter how hard the people prayed the materials just washed away\nThey could have used rocks, rocks don't bend or bow\nBut quite frankly they had too many enemies to stone\nIn the Empire (the Empire) State\nThe Empire State is Building\nThe Taj is on fire; these horus cats make a killing\nHeathens bow down to the sirens\nAn emergency for bread and cheese (rioters shut up and freeze)\nUhh, the Earth shall inherit the meek\nWhen Canada puts up a fence cause their medicine's so cheap\nAmerica's asleep (yeah I'm snoring)\nAnd London Bridge is... and London Bridge is falling\n\nI got the best seat in the house\nThey hired me as a watchman - London Bridge is falling\nIndia's got salt on its coast\nThere's a tea party in boston, London Bridge is..\n\nMade of stainless steel and wrought iron\nThat wall in China ain't so great, I built a bridge over a hymen\nIt goes up to the sky and Mother Mary is cryin\nMy fair lady, don't cry, it's gonna be alright!\nCus I'm alive - I'm alive and kickin\nTea party in Boston (tea party in Boston~!!)\nThe London Bridge is falling (the London Bridge is falling)\nThe London Bridge is falling!
