A nigga gonna do, go outside?\nSmoke a blunt in the car and come back\nAnd get some love in the club\n\n[Verse 1]\nI see a lot of hoes, they all on my dick\nBunch of player haters wanna front for a bitch\nIf a bitch want to fuck me, then let her do her thing\nJust step the fuck back, and let her give me brain\nI'm insane like Hussein\nIt's like I got two brains\nSee my shoe game\nAnd say them shit's butane, y'all niggas too lame\nMy bill game like poontang\nNine niggas on a track like Wu-Tang\nShoot like a two guard from Tulane\nBig Ving Rhames niggas at the door\nLike, like, like, you rang? No need for ID\nWalk straight past security, they don't search me\nPut three numbers in my phone 'fore I reach VIP\n\n[Hook]\nWhen it's hot, you need another drink\nWhat you think? A nigga gonna do, go outside\nSmoke a blunt in the car and come back\nAnd get some love in the club\nWhen it's hot, you need another drink\nWhat you think? A nigga gonna do, go outside\nSmoke a blunt in the car and come back\nAnd get some love in the club\n\n[Verse 2]\nOn the block, and on the street\nThey keep banging, they keep banging them trees\nNo seeds in my cigarillo, we be blacker than Romillo\nTasting like Sugar Hills, let me pop another pill\nSilver eighteen hundred\nKryptonite, yep, yep, yep, I'm on it\nNo not Superman you can call it X-Clan\nBlack red and green, sissies\nAll my bitches eat pussy like Missy\nBut they look like Chrissy\nFrom Three's Company, roll another blunt for me\nSmoke so much weed like I'm tryna lose my memory\nLike I'm tryna smoke away my mad thoughts\nBlunt gave 'em up, a bit too bad go\nShe wanna hit it, and I do too\nI ain't talking 'bout the weed bitch, I'm talking 'bout you\n\n[Hook]\nWhen it's hot, you need another drink\nWhat you think? A nigga gonna do, go outside\nSmoke a blunt in the car and come back\nAnd get some love in the club\nWhen it's hot, you need another drink\nWhat you think? A nigga gonna do, go outside\nSmoke a blunt in the car and come back\nAnd get some love in the club", "year": "2010-03-16"}], "artist": "Danny Brown"}
