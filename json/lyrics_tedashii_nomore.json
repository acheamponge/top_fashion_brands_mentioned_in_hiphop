(talk to y'all)\nI got caught in this mess yearning to walk in the flesh and thirst for Him less watching her walk in that dress\nI saw the cross and how it took me from the worldly things and how He told me to count loss the dross and earthly things\nI know I wanna sin (hey) but dog I'm born again (hey) and by His grace He displaced my disgrace and now it's on again\nSo I'm a buffet my body make it my slave main crucify my flesh daily til I see my grave main\nI'm a fight and your games I won't play them no more, to the world listen up, we fed up, we not gon take this no more\n\nWe ain't no slave to sin, we ain't no slave to sin, we not gon take it no more because we born again\nWe ain't no slave to sin, we ain't no slave to sin, we not gon take it no more because we born again\nWe ain't no slave to sin, we ain't no slave to sin, we not gon take it no more because we born again\nWe ain't no slave to sin, we ain't no slave to sin, we not gon take it no more because we born again"}], "artist": "Tedashii"}
