Blidge\nOnly whack through my eyes\nIf you could see what I saw\nAt the age of ten, probably wondering\nExactly how I made it in\nThat is how I made it out\nSix years, back up dancing\nOnly 'till I figured out\nThat I could do my thing\nNow I'm sixteen chasing dreams\nThat many dream about\nBut I'm on my shit, got what mad\nLet him paint the picture out\nI put work in, little later\nCapitol gets interested\nPut more work in\nNow we got the album that we're putting out\nMy dream's really genuine\nAnd now the pressure's building up\nSix little children that be looking up\nNo time to be f*cking up\nBut daddy and his granny always looking down\nDaddy's little girl is more like a woman now\nPlus I understand\nI couldn't stay at mommy's house\nMommy was so hurting\nCause the man she fell in love with\nWas resting six feet under ground\nOh no, you couldn't walk down my road\nCouldn't stay in my room, oh no\nAll my life, let me show you all the pain\nThat I've been through in my life\nWell I'm eighteen now\nFeet planted in the soil\nI ain't spoiled in my ways\nI deserve what I made and more\nFuture's looking brighter then it was before\nI was running wild in them streets\nWith the boys in the heat\nWhat I find I'm a keep\nI won't stand for defeat\nDemand everything\nThat gold made me prosper\nWatch the charts\nI'm coming a hundred miles, I'm running\nMy pass is my pants\nI'm anxious for what's coming, forthcoming\nI won't rest 'till I'm hanging with my pops\nWon't stop 'till I'm hanging with my pops\nGod bless me, won't rest\n'Till I'm hanging with my pops\nWon't stop 'till I'm hanging with my pops\nGod bless me\nYou couldn't walk down my road\nCouldn't stand in my shoes, oh\nMy life, let me show you all the things\nThat I've been through, oh\nMy life, my life, ooh oh, my life yeah, oh\nCouldn't walk down my road, my shoes", "title": "My Life", "album": "International"}], "artist": "Ak\u2019sent"}
