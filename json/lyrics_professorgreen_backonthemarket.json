I'm a vet\nI can kill, I don't play, I rap skilled\nI quit rap and then I got a tax bill\nHeap up, better speed up\nSpeak on it, better speak up\nDon't worry about what I'm lean off\nOr pee'd off cause I'm P'd up\nPigs took away my license\nYou see all that laughter? Dead it\nCause last July, when I got a new whip\nParked it outside the police station\nWaited till I seen that pig and then revved it\nCommotion, I'm bursting\nSomebody hand me a little potion\nWhat's the motion [?], feel a lot of demotion\nFeel a lot of emotion\nI'm emotive\nAnybody saying they're the boss has since been demoted\nWhat? Demotion\nLook, it's hard out here in these times\nThese guys have got no hope\nTheir flow's coke, it's been stepped on\nLike three times, they've got weak lines\nDead lines, they've got no shots\nThese shots at me? I mean, these swines\nI grew up in E5\nWhere you hear shots and then police sirens\nYour girl's a groupie, blud\nI see her preeing me\nYour life's a movie, but\nIt went straight to DVD\nI'm still the pro, bro\nI'm still a fiend\nSo who's got all the pills?\nSomebody spill the beans\nBlimey, I'm grimy\nThe way I'm rhyming just might be\nThe reason all of these hot spices\nWanna season my meat\nIt's all about the timing\nDon't watch mine\nJust went and copped a new watch\nTo make up for lost time\nI've got a new watch, it's a Hublot\nOr is it Hublot? Fuck it, who knows\nI'm lying anyway, it's an AP\nDon't make me get old school, put on my AP\nBig up Time, big up AP\nVirgin ain't the label that pays me\nVirgin ain't the label that pays me\nVirgin ain't the label-\nBack in it, give me the jab like a vaccine and\nSit back and relax a bit\nAs I strap you in and inject the vaccination\nYou ain't ever gonna rap dissing\nKeep practising\nYou never know, it might pay off\nIf you see Jammz or Ethan\nKnow that it's day dot\nBadboys from day, from day, no, day\nArmy? Are you barmy\nYou'll need an army to harm me\nPG, but I yell out \"cunt\"\nOn live TV like Harvey\n\"Hello, you cunt\"\nI said hello, you cunt, not Ella, you cunt\nBut Ella's a cunt\nYou can tell I'm a cunt, one hell of a cunt\nCause I tend to get ahead of myself\nSo full of shit, I need an enema\nI would rather listen to Enya\nThan any of you on my stereo\nWickedest ting to come out of my area\nIt's Pro, dig a hole, I'll bury ya\nWhy in the world would I ever remarry her?\nMarry her? I've got all these hoes in the Marriott\nGive me that spliff and let me spark it\nBoy, I ain't even started\nI don't miss any exes\nI'm always on the target\nScarlet in my glass\nWith a whip that'll make you car-sick\nFootloose and fancy free\nYeah, I'm back on the market\nA platinum artist\nBut I'll still shit on your carpet\nBack on the market\nPiss on your parade\nBack on the market\nMoney can't buy you class\nBack on the market\nBut it can buy you class A\nBack on the market", "year": "2016-09-12"}]}
