I\nI'm riding 'round in the night\nMy body is moving, I'm tryna get groovin', yeah\nWhat's going down in your head? I\nI'm riding 'round in the night\nI'm tryna get groovin', let's go to the beach and jump in\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh they trusted her and she tried to be\nEverything that they want her to\nBut she had to see what she could do\nAnd all the things that she would also\nTell me one thing\nIs it really bad to have experience?\nThen you know for yourself\nRather than sit home and believe in this\nThey said, \"Willow don't touch that\"\nI looked and walked and then I went and touched it\nThey said, \"Don't walk fast\"\nI took off running and was not near stopping\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat's going down in your town? I\nI'm riding 'round in the night\nMy body is moving, I'm tryna get groovin', yeah\nWhat's going down in your town? I\nI'm riding 'round\nI'm gonna go, baby, the frequency\nYou wanna roll with me\n\n[Bridge]\nBroken\nTwo shards that fit together\nHoping\nMore come together\nTo make a piece of art\nBigger than anything we could imagine\nTo make a piece of art\nThat's raising the whole vibration of gaia\nGoing right back to the ropes\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat's going down in your town? I\nI'm riding 'round in the night\nMy body is moving, I'm tryna get groovin', yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/47e950d4037e02d2f0c7a9888f03b3dd.1000x1000x1.jpg", "album": "ARDIPITHECUS", "title": "UR Town"}]}
