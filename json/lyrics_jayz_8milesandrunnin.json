Where was you before I blew this up?\nI didn't see you in the courtroom when everybody was suin' us\nI didn't see you in all black when everybody was suitin' up\nBack on the block, getting it in, there wasn't no you with us\n\n[Hook: Jay Z + Freeway]\n8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'\nAnd my eighth album comin'\nFeeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!\n6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'\nAnd my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs\n8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'\nAnd my eighth album comin'\nFeeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!\n6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'\nAnd my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs\n\n[Verse 2: Freeway]\n6 miles and runnin' in the Pontiac six thousand eighty six\nTrans might shift while the engine run\nAnyone tell your honor: \"Give me one more chance.\"\nAnd them smokers screaming, \"One more gram!\"\nSo I'ma bring 'em one\nOnly son to my pop, stick close to my mama\nKeep toasters for drama, make Salat with my son\nMy son growin' and he learnin' a lot\nThat's when them toasters, when the burners will pop\nBrain on your, um\u2013brella, a nigga, tell 'em niggas\nThat's like the Biblical scripture\nLook back, turn to salt, like the sinners\nMost of your heartless and self-centered\nLike Meshach and Mesha\nSet up your brother \u2018cause you jealous, nigga\nThe heat back, like you never left\nI ever rep, cops watch every step\nSix miles and runnin', dodgin' every trap\nThe rap gingerbread man\nCherish every precious breath, state P the second gat\n\n[Hook: Jay Z + Freeway]\n8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'\nAnd my eighth album comin'\nFeeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!\n6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'\nAnd my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs\n8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'\nAnd my eighth album comin'\nFeeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!\n6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'\nAnd my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nBack when nobody would find he had talent\nNobody would sign me\nNobody believed in me, nobody but Mommy blindly\nBut how can she deny me?
