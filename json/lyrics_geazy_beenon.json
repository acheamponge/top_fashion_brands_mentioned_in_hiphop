I'm like \"hardly, pal\"\nBlack on black with hair slicked back, boy, I got the hardest style\nAnd I'm always snatching chicks\nFlier than Aladdin's whips\nHaters on the sideline bitter, hella fucking mad he's rich\nTook your darling off your arm, now she just wanna be daddy's bitch\nThey can't even find me where I'm chillin' like my addy switched\nYeah, breaking rules, we all bent 'em\nDreaming about these M's, told my team \"let's all get 'em\"\nMake a classic song, last as long as raw denim\nEvery track's a problem, what I spit is all venom\n\n[Chorus]\nEveryday I got some fly shit on\nKeeping all black outfit on\nI already bagged most the chicks\nThat you out here trying to get on\nYou just catching up to what I've been on\nYeah, that's what I've been on\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI see what you trying to do, that's not even kinda new\nThat's the shit I've been on\nAll these girls you see around, I already took 'em down\nThat's the shit I've been on\nThat's the shit I've been on\nThat's the shit I've been on"}]}
