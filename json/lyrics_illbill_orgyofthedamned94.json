Simpson would turn into Joeeeel Rifkin\n\nWelcome to the Orgy of the Damned\nWelcome to the Orgy of the Damned\nOrgy of the Damned\nWelcome to the Orgy of the Damned\nExperience all your lusts and fantasies first hand\n\nI'm searching for hitchhiking virgins\nYeah, you know, the type of girl that's down for like what ever's your perversion\nShe's got the itch but doesn't know quite how to scratch it\nSo I'm slipping the bitch amoeba during a surgic acid\nTo cause a Cumshot Bonanza\nThe way I'm getting all up in that ass you'd think I was a case of colon cancer\nPlus I'm diseased in the mental\nAnd when I'm feeling stressed I inject direct to my left ventricle\nPumping fluids containing pharmaceuticals to keep me kooky\nSome people would describe my vibe as spooky\nOr freaky, cause I be kinkier than Luther Campbell\nThe pussy vandal, sticking my fingers in for samples\n\n(Chorus X2)\n\nI'm doing the type of sex that pimps do\nJheri curls be hanging out my hat like I was down with Eazy-E's crew\nCreeping through public transportation terminals\nLooking for alcoholic sluts willing to use their mouths as urinals\nI like a really touchy-feely\n3 girls and some baby oil squirming on my Posturepedic suite\nSome and join in by a cult of love\nI'll initiate you with some anastatics and a rubber glove\nI get my kicks from watching chick flicks\nEuropean women shooting around out their lactating tits\nNow that's what I call entertainment\nSome into the Orgy of the Damned and free yourselves from the enslaaaavements\n\n(Chorus X 2)\n\nSoya juice", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2bac33967790d87128fa9676f5b0c7b0.600x600x1.jpg", "album": "The Early Years: Rare Demos \u201991-\u201994", "year": "2003-09-16"}]}
