'bout to get on this shit\nAnd straight murder everything Brooklyn style\nYou already know nigga\nIt's Young M.A, remember that nigga\n\n[Verse 1: Young M.A]\nMy squad is a bunch of niggas with no manners\nWe hold hammers\nBetter duck when that gun flash, no cameras\nNo jammin', my gun blammin'\nYour bullets flying but not landing\nGod damnit, my hands cramping\nThis big cannon do big damage\nHeat on my side, my hip tanning\nMy nigga Danger keep the grip near him\nThey shot my nigga like 5 times but he's still alive and he's still standing\nB.I.P to my big bro from 88 to 09\nI swear to god it would be problems if that nigga was still alive\nTell these niggas don't fuck with me\nI'm not in the right state of mind\nPut the Desert Eagle to his forehead and make the nigga have a change of mind\nStop talking that tough shit cause you dyke bitches ain't bout that\nHeard niggas out here rattin' so I had to set up my mouse traps\nBlow a stack and I bounce back\nHit me up for that loud pack\nGot shishkaberry, got cookie kush\nGot white widow, a whole pound of that\nFuck a squad, I'm three deep\nYou got 10 niggas that's 10 sheep\nPlus these pussy niggas don't want beef\nCause they all chicken, 10 piece\nI'm in Crown Heights, I'm in Bed-Stuy\nI'm in Brownsville, I'm in C.I\nI'm in east New York where them things bump\nIf a nigga die we don't talk, shh\nThat's Brooklyn nigga\nThem TEC-9s'll cook a nigga\nTurn his brains into pudding nigga\nI'm not a killer but don't push a nigga\nI swear to god I will pull it nigga\nMiddle finger to them lookin' niggas\nYou say you got shooters on the roof\nWell I got shooters in the bushes nigga\nNever ever been a pussy type\nBut I know a lot of pussy dykes\nYour shit's trash, you can't rap\nAnd the engineer should've took your mic\nYou ain't a thug, you the mushy type\nFall in love and be hooked for life\nYou the type that'll kill your bitch\nIf she tried to leave and get booked for life\nI'm really a calm nigga but the niggas round me is really rowdy\nI'm the type if I don't fuck with you\nDon't come near me, don't come around me\nThis loud pack that we smokin' on\nGot the whole car lookin' really cloudy\nI'm riding 'round in that white Chevy but my next whip is that black Audi\nIt's Brooklyn nigga, that's King's County\nNiggas hate, don't know a thing about me\nOnly real niggas I bring around me\nFuck your foriegns, I rock Jordans\nWith a tank top and a Jesus piece\nThat flashy shit you niggas wearing really don't mean shit to me\nI got young boys that'll rob you\nFor your ACs and credit cards too\nWith that 380 it ain't hard to\nSo cooperate or they sparkin' you\nI was born alone, I'ma die alone\nFuck friends I don't need any\nI love money, I get money\nI got money and I got plenty\nMr Hayes, when they let you out\nI'm right there with them weapons out\nYou a fake blood, a disloyal nigga\nAnd they gone have to bring them stretchers out\nCause I'm not playing\n20 shots, pussy clot to your chest nigga\nYou killed my brother now you rest nigga\nNaw, fuck that, I got more to say\nI know these hoes ain't loyal\nMotherfucker I wasn't born today\nFuck M.O.B, I'm M.O.E\nI'm just tryna grind and duck the Ds\nI told niggas I don't gang bang but for my bro I throw up them Bs\nIt's Pain Gang, RedLyfe\nDon't fuck with them and don't fuck with me\nThis is Brooklyn nigga, what the fuck you mean?\n\n[Verse 2: Rell]\nI was kicked out with my shit out\nBut I been out with my pen out\nThe paper here when I dish out\nI got a thick snout when that fish out\nI want the money, cars, got the hoes\nBut that skrilla all on my search route\nNo growth spurts but my money sprout\nGot a bad bitch with a fat ass\nWhen she twerk out that's a workout\nBut the first scout, I done passed out\nWith her ass out and my cash out\nShe opened up and I splashed out\nI done broke the [?], bring a cask' out\nI'm the best in it and the last out\nI'm the last out and the best in it\nY'all hiding niggas bring the mask out\nY'all garbage niggas keep the trash out\nIf you talkin' shit you better watch your mouth\nCause your snot box will get busted out\nI don't talk 'bout it, I walk it out\nI'm 19 and my stance strong\nMy money green and my pen lean\nI'm a damn fiend for this damn green\nHit the damn scene with the fam, homies, and the damn team\nI been here and I been there\nHer pussy wet, no swimwear\nBut I'm in there with my army gear\nCan't trust hoes, don't trust niggas\nJust trust yourself and your fucking figures\nI did this and I did that\nHer pussy fat, I did that and I did this\nAnd I'm all about my business\nAnd there ain't no competition, I'm vicious\nIn the booth I put a nigga on the hit list\nDear god can I get a witness?\nI slayed that and I slaughtered this\nCause I'm a motherfucking menace nigga\nI'm 19, when that light green\nShe might scream for that pipe me\nThese light bars for that ripe cheese\nHomies got bars for that hype fees\nI got loud, come holler at me\nEtcetera, some OG\nA quick talk for that QP\nAnd I'm out the sky with a blue dream\nBrooklyn where I reside at\nMoney all in that sty rack\nA couple niggas that's OT\nIf you can't handle, they'll fly back\nStudio, and I'm on beats\nNo time for me to get sidetracked\nIn the booth steady going skytzo\nI'm working hits with my mind strap\nCan't stop me then fuck with me\nOr follow up, get in line scrap\nFuck you and who you fuck with\nThis money here, this paper fat\nGotta grind so I'm a go-getter\nNiggas fake and I'm so realer\nBeat war and I'm a gorilla\nMJ and I'm so Thriller\nCan't fuck with me, I'm that nigga\nYou typing scared, nigga that figures\nI can take your thot, I bring back figures\nFlipping musically with a couple hitters\nThat's [immune?] to get it with a crip triggers\nGotta hit a nigga, backflip a nigga\nPistol whip a bitch and ziplock a nigga\nGo kill a nigga when he feeling froggish\nThrow me a beat and I'm getting on it\nAnd I'm getting on it and I'm shitting on it\nA bad bitch in my radar, I'm murking it, then I'm dipping on it\nIn the booth spitting and I'm killing on it\nAnd I'm living on it\nPay attention bitch cause my dick enormous\nAnd they looking gorgeous and they getting on it\nAnd they only want me cause a nigga ballin'\n\n[Verse 3: La Montana]\nIt's RedLyfe, man it's RedLyfe\nMan it's RedLyfe, ain't no joke\nRollin' with so many blue 30's nigga would've thought I was loc\nCall my patria up, said I'm heavy up, man a nigga need that coke\n'Cause my boaty niggas wade, and my Russians need that dope\nStay with that four-five for niggas thinking I'm chucha\nYeah kiate la boca 'fore I hit 'em when I drove by\n[?] any nigga approach La, you know why 'cause they no lie\nIf you know La, I don't lie\nIf I say so you gon' die\nI done shipped more niggas than a boat ride\nDone pimped more bitches than Don Juan\nI'm pimping right now while the song's on\nMy bitches don't play, them 30's on\nMy niggas don't play, our arm is long\nFeeling like Jordan nigga, this our song\n23 hour shifts all night long\nY'all regular niggas act like shones\nThat 40 cal gon' take him away\nLike a landlord I put him in place\nNigga dead from a pole off the waist\nSeperate his head from the front of his face\nTake his legs, turn them under his waist\nBitch ass feds tryna build a case\nLookin' ass niggas, I'll give 'em DNA\nI fuck your wife and I nut in your face", "album": null, "year": "2014-07-17", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9df8ed3210323d9d5849bee39a473ebc.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Young
