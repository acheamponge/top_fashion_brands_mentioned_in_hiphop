Who goes there? Have no fear, it's just I\nWho showed you what you can't see with just eyes\nI kept it justice and poetry over beats and hoaxes\nMy city win like the Chicago beat\nI took a chance and rapped like I'm a Chicago breed, for realer\nIf I ain't the most dope, than it's Mac Miller\n'Coz these days I wear many faces\nRollin' up a drough tree Californicatin'", "title": "16 Bars (Freestyle)", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/filepicker-images-rapgenius/0sfhqn8qSr0cTamFCJUd_ab-soul-dwtw-interview-3.jpg", "year": "2014-07-07"}], "artist": "Ab-Soul"}
