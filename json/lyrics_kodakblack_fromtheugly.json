'cuz i stay flashing\nWhy you think nobody like you 'cuz you stay flagging\nIf i stay consistent with it I can buy an Aston\nI got shawty booted up she giving me daffy\nPower high fuckin with me, he makin me happy\nI just bought a new strap, I'm ready to blast it\nEverybody in here with me straight bop-whacking\nI can make a millie in my reebok classics\nI forgot to bring the poker but i brought the flathead\nBout to make the bands drop, straight pop magic\n\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm from the ugly corner where we do a nigga nasty\nEverybody toting straps, everybody trapping\nJit just jump up off the porch now he making it happen\nThis for all my young niggas up the road snapping\nBig wheels, big bills, big automatics\nAll a nigga wanna do is ball like the mavericks\nI could get a Rolls Royce if i keep snapping\nDope boys, wrap the slabs in the plastic"}]}
