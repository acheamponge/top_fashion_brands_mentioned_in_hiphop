I'll probably never pull you chair out, bitch\nYou know this money grew your hair out, switch\nAll that shit I bought you wear out\nRich, and I'm the only one I care about\nPlace none above me, God don't like ugly\nHate me or love me, only he can judge me\nUnpolished, unapologetic\nBig willie with the blow, niggas, I am legend\nSchool of hard knock, I attended\nSelling hard rock, fuck who I offended\nI was a goner, punished by karma\nCalled him tar baby, now he\u2019s transcending genres\nThe 911 came with the ass shots\nA toothless crackhead was the mascot\nThe owner of the key to that padlock\nI\u2019m Jordan versus Cavs for the last shot\nI need all mine, reparations\nWe growin' poppy seeds on my 40 acres\nPush!\n\n[Chorus: The-Dream]\nTrouble world, trouble child\nTrouble times destroyed my smile\nNo change of heart, no change of mind\nYou can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine\nI'd rather die, than go home\nI'd rather die, than go home\nAnd I ain't leaving without my 40 acres", "year": "2013-10-07"}]}
