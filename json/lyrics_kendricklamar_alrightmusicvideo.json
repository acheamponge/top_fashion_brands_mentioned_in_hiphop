Ahhh!\nI remembered you was conflicted\nMisusing your influence\nSometimes I did the same\nAbusing my power full of resentment\nResentment that turned into a deep depression\nFound myself screaming in the hotel room\nLucifer was all around\nSo I kept running\nUntil I found my safe haven\nI was trying to convince myself the stripes I got\nMaking myself realize what my foundation was\n(In the room, and I run it)\n(Bluh! Bluh! Bluh! Bluh!)\nBut while my loved ones were fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one\nA war that was based on apartheid and discrimination\n\n[Interlude]\nAy on my momma nigga (R.I.P. Pat Dawg)\nI'mma be the greatest to ever do this shit\nOn my momma doe like\nOn the dead homies\nAye Sounwave turn this shit up nigga\nTurn this shit up! Sounwave, turn this shit up nigga\nTell me, who the bitch nigga hatin' on me?\nJumping on my dick, but this dick ain't free\nTo Pimp a Butterfly, another classic CD\nGhetto lullaby for every one-day MC\n(Bluh! Bluh! Bluh! Bluh!)\nNigga, now R.I.P\nMy diligence is only meant to write your eulogy\n\n[Intro]\nAlls my life I has to fight, nigga\nAlls my life I...\nHard times like, \"God!\"\nBad trips like, \"Yea!\"\nNazareth, I'm fucked up\nHomie you fucked up\nBut if God got us\nThen we gon' be alright\n\n[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nWe gon' be alright\nDo you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nHuh? We gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nDo you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright\n\n[Verse 1]\nUh, and when I wake up\nI recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut\nBut homicide be lookin' at you from the face down\nWhat Mac-11 even boom with the bass down\nSchemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life\nPainkillers only put me in the twilight\nWhere pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight\nNow tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows\n20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me\nReapin' everything I sow, so my karma come\nAnd heaven no preliminary hearing, so my record\nI'm a motherfuckin' gangster in silence for the record\nTell the world I know it's too late\nBoys and girls, I think I gone cray\nDrown inside my vices all day\nWon't you please believe when I say\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWouldn't you know\nWe been hurt, been down before\nNigga, when our pride was low\nLookin' at the world like, \"Where do we go?\"\nNigga, and we hate po-po\nWanna kill us dead in the street fo sho\nNigga, I'm at the preacher's door\nMy knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow\nBut we gon' be alright\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nWe gon' be alright\nDo you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nHuh? We gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nDo you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhat you want, you a house, you a car?\n40 acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?\nAnything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog\nMotherfucker, you can live at the mall\nI can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal\nI don't think about it, I deposit every little zero\nThinkin' of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal\nDiggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you\nEveryday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you\nIn the presence of your chico... ah!\nI don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel\nIf I got it then you know you got it, heaven, I can reach you\nPat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all\nBick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all\nI rap, I black on track so rest assured\nMy rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWouldn't you know\nWe been hurt, been down before\nNigga, when our pride was low\nLookin' at the world like, \"Where do we go?\"\nNigga, and we hate po-po\nWanna kill us dead in the street fo sho\nNigga, I'm at the preacher's door\nMy knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow\nBut we gon' be alright\n\n[Chorus]\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nWe gon' be alright\nDo you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nHuh? We gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nDo you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright\n\n[Outro]\nI keep my head up high\nI cross my heart and hope to die\nLovin' me is complicated\nToo afraid, a lot of changes\nI'm alright, and you're a favorite\nDark nights in my prayers\n\n[Poem]\nI remembered you was conflicted\nMisusing your influence, sometimes I did the same\nAbusing my power full of resentment\nResentment that turned into a deep depression\nFound myself screaming in the hotel room\nI didn't wanna self-destruct\nThe evils of Lucy was all around me\nSo I went running for answers"}], "artist": "Kendrick Lamar"}
