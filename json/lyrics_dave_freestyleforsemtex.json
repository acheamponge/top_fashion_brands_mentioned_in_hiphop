face\nDrink in my hand\nHand in my pouch\nMan talk greaze\nMan look left look right look straight to a bang in the mouth\nMan talk grease\nMan see man in the flesh, man sayin' please just dead it\nMan talk grease in the whip\nCome out the car, and come in like Niko Bellic\nAhhh\nI phone up like we want a pizza\nA flip blade or a sweet in a heater\nTo touch more skin than Mia Khalifa\nYour man said come round the corner you're joking\nMan tryna talk like he's touching us\nYour man best run when he see man come son you can get a tiger- tiger- tiger uppercut\nI'm next in line bruv\nThey got my brothers doing next to life cuz\nRing ring on a lyca lyca\nFor food in the club like tyga tyga hyper hyper boys doing cyber cyber\nSee man in the flesh dark\nTalk big on the nets dark\nBread in pen and kill a cyberman like David Tennant\nAhhh\nMad ting I went back to paper\nBack to my notepad\nBack to basics\nBack to black in fact I went back to back\nStack to stack from a penny to half a grand\nHad to find myself I wasn't looking right\nIn a state could've got your g hurt like mulla light\nFatalistic thoughts, I swear I could've died\nThat's why I ain't wrote a thing since\nWell\nI can't confine my pain to a sentence\nI sentence you that's pain in a sentence\nI got a sentence explained in a sentence\nThat's 18 years explained in a sentence\nThe way I'm living's been so peak\nIntroverted, my friends don't know me\nCause more time I'm walking on my lonelies\nOr in the graveyard talking to my homie\nBelieve me\nBelieve me this life ain't easy\nWhy do you think the mandem rarely ever see me\nWhy do think I gave up dreams of a CD\nWhy do you think I splash as soon as I see P's\nChief Keef\nPrada's 300 get funding before he could beef me\nHow could I spend like a grand on clothes\nStill refused to spend a pound on\n**Kisses teeth**\nAdvertising draws\nMaking songs about gunplay\nYou dumb youts are bringing more heat to your strip than a runway\nWhat a plain bar\nHad my brother in Feltham that's Heathrow\nWhat a plane bar\nAnd I bet that flew over your head what a plane bar\nThat's runway Heathrow plane bars\nAnd on Sundays we still claim ours\nCause them Polish guys don't sleep\nAnd Sergey still needs\nDimitry still needs cheese\nI do it for them for the guys that still move green\nLine to line, crime to crime I still see P's\nGucci scarves back I still see G's\nPrison visits I still see C\nOnce we had to hide down I still see B\nGot into the graveyard I still see A\nUnemployed and I still got paid\nSkipping school just if we still got A's\nGirls say I got gassed in change\nAnd I say damn right look at my trainers babe\nListen\nNone of you man want beef and none of you man want heat\nListen\nNone of you man want beef, none of you man want heat\nListen, listen\nLook, look\nLike none of you man want beef and none of you man want heat\nNone of you man want smoke\nNone of you man make P's\nNone of you, none of you\nNone of you man seen cash\nNone of you man own straps\nNeither do I\nIf I need that I got boys that will bring heat with the 4\nI am in Dubai nah\nBut I still think I am in Dubai\nNo rapper's 'liver than I\nSergey phoned like I wanna buy\n5 of the brown\n5 of the white\nWrite that down, give it to my guy on a bike\nWho gives it to my guy on a fly\nI\u2019me the guy that sells to the guy on the left\nAnd I probably sell to the guy on the right\nThis line's so long I could peddle white to the guy in the sky\nMaybe it's rude\nMaybe it's true\nTrap line's local\nMoney tight but I've never seen a total\nWhy?\n'Cause I got money in halves\n'Cause I got money in queues\n**Kisses teeth**\nMan\n'Cause I got money in squares\n'Cause I got money in shoes\nBut are you really from your ends mate?\n'Cause you're really doing wheelies on your ends mate\nAnd we're really drawing beanies from your ends mate\nMy kitchen will have you fleeing from your estate\nI rush man I'll have you filled in the next day\nI touch man I saw twingin like a Sensei\nI brush man, I Van Gogh with the red paint\nChornobyl feel heat when that leg raise\nI grab man and start squeezing his neck mate\nLike three's you won't leave unless I see ps by the next day\nHeat in the next way\nHeat in BE's and I leave a G weak\nAnd he's easily easily beaten by flow\nShow respect when you speak\nAnd I **fights back tears**\nHe's screaming like please can i make a new ho-\nAh I'm bleeding but fe- **kisses teeth/laughs**\nI'm needing a friend to help me to say no\nAnd he's holding a weapon talking to a demon\nBro I swear I ain't letting you go\nListen I'm calm in colly\nLink Holly from Colly\nThat\u2019s Holly from Colliers Wood\nNah I'm calm it's golly link donny in Totty\nThat's money that's payment in full\nNah I don't bark no shotties\nNo hearts for thotties\nNo time for a girl or a friend\nI just go my lessons it's less than a blessing\nIt's comfy in colly\nThe end\nAh man", "year":
