Jet, get your mittens, little kitten\nRun\u2014the MCs I battle be missing\nI say, \u201cDamn!\u201d  Still repping the peeps\nI straight BLAM!  My best weapon\u2019s the beat\nYo, you stepping to C?  I\u2019m collecting your fee\nLet\u2019s swing an episode of speech backseat of my Jeep\nIn the street, Casio, or MPC\nMy technique through audio or MP3\nMy [?] clip yelling, \u201cEmpty me!\u201d (\u201cEmpty me!\u201d)\nPutting heads to bed.  Putting heads to rest now\nI write down screenplays for my [?]\n\n[Verse 4: L.I.F.E. Long]\nI rhyme in black fitted-out sets while\nShadowboxing with the silhouette of death gasping for breath\nTryna find the light [?] of darkness\nMy world parallel to hell where fools dwell with the same stories to tell\nEverybody wants they record to sell\nBut I\u2019d rather excel than spit nothing over recycled [?]\nToo many get caught up in the same money scheme, which makes you wonder, \u201cHow many damn ways [?]\u201d\nTalking queen but holding [?]\u2014that\u2019s why I\u2019m issuing out waitlists for the rent\nCracking your chin, leaving you with a permanent cleft\n\n[Verse 5: Orko the Sycotik Alien]\nMy broken English of a beat-breaks underground overlord\nUnemotional, unattached with an unorthodox angle\nWalk with an angel of death.  My breath control like Storm, the mutant X-Man\nI don\u2019t assimilate, so don\u2019t associate my name with weakness in the chain\u2014that don\u2019t fit\nFunny how MCs that wanna freestyle all night long\nDon\u2019t got enough composure and focus to write a dope song\nI\u2019d rather sock your mouth than say a dope line\nNo metaphors or similes\u2014victory is mine"}]}
