Poor, no (Oh)\nSex cells (Yeah?) Hormone (Ha)\nTake off (What?) Your clothes (Yeah)\nI got it down to a T (No wardrobe)\nWe came a long way from selling albums in the boot\nNow we drop a song and see the shit has landed on the news\nWhen you're makin' money watch what will family do 'cause\nThat's how you decide whoever's relative to you\nIf you rate this and feel this dog then make a playlist\nOf the real 6 God and be the channel with the views\nMoney so high up but it fuckin' won't die\nBut if numbers don't lie then I'm tellin' 'em the truth\nI\"ll rock a purse, that crazy bitch\nWhen I drop a verse, yo, a fat lady sings\nI think my mum and dad should get back making kids\nIf I ain't the best born fuckin' Matt Damon is\n\n[Chorus: Travy P (360)]\nThey can hear me, they don't see me though\nNowadays on my UFO\nIn a league of my own\nDon't tell me what they want\nDon't say it's been my time (Don't say it's been my time)\nRight now I'm just living life (Livin' life)\nYou know what I'm here to do (You know what I'm hear to do)\nSo I've got nuttin' to prove\n\n[Verse 2: 360]\nHey yo, I'm grimy, recording every verse up in a payphone\nDo it by the book, but I'm skimming every page though\nYou'll be bored as until the time you see play though\nEven as support act I'm still the fuckin' main show\nI can find a silver lining every time it rains though\nGrab the pot of gold while they lookin' at that rainbow\nNinety-five percent is the amount I'ma save though\nThe other five is fuck around money, call it Play-Doh\nWhy does everybody in this game rap the same?\nI can put a fuckin' stop to this shit: Drake flow\nBody all these unknown bitches: Jane Doe\nWhen I say bitches I'm talkin' 'bout how many\nFigures will I aim for, I can figure eight more\nGrade me on the paper, boy, why you want that A4?\nYou ain't in the same league, let alone the same sport\nYou can't put a baseball player next to a racehorse\n\n[Verse 3: Travy P]\nBeen a minute, now I'm back in it\nThought I was down, now I'm back winning\nThought I would lose, huh? Yeah\nBut I ain't no loser (Travy)\nI ain't ever fell off\nAlways been a good fella, yeah\nVeteran like De Niro\nSo now I stack hella zero's\nPent house on the top floor\nI guess I ain't got no floors, dog\nGirl, suck me like she jawless\nShang Tsung, I be flawless\nShang Tsung, I be flawless, yeah\nShang Tsung, I be flawless, yeah\nShang Tsung, I be flawless, yeah\nShang Tsung, I be flawless, yeah\n\n[Chorus: Travy P (360)]\nThey can hear me, they don't see me though\nNowadays on my UFO\nIn a league of my own\nDon't tell me what they want\nDon't say it's been my time (Don't say it's been my time)\nRight now I'm just living life (Livin' life)\nYou know what I'm hear to do (You know what I'm hear to do)\nSo I've got nuttin' to prove"}]}
