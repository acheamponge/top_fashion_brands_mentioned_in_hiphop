Hold on tight, Daddy got ya\nYea, we finna see cloud 99\nBippin' (?) on the finest pallet sippin' on the finest wine\nI'm fitten my K-E to the J-A-G-G\nMake these women come to fast every time they see me\nGet a whiff of the aura it's hereditary\nGirl I do it nothin' less than legendary\n\n[Hook:]\n\n[Verse 2: Big KRIT]\nFirst off, shawdy let me ball a bit\nI got the type of Candy paint that will make you lick up all of it\nSticky icky dreams, crude to seen, and I drop the roof\nCause once you lose your cool, ain't no tellin' what these (?) do\nAny bitch can get in the way and sometimes you jus' gotta let 'em go\nGod gave you all of that and sometimes you jus' gotta let it show\nI'll just let you know off the real though\nI'm curious where the hit bowl\nLet me get deep in your mental, B-P in your tempo\nI know just what you need, so lets not waste no time\nI'll work you like a B, rip and break you down\nShawdy let me see it, let me see it then\nOver let me see it\nDon't be teasing let me beep it\nCause I know how to treat it\nLike a old school, display it in my show room\nUnder lights, over night, light it up like I'm supposed to\nProblem is you probably lookin' to be my number one\nTo keep it real, I'm just here for the night and I'm tryin' to have some fun\n\n[Hook:]"}], "artist": "Big K.R.I.T."}
