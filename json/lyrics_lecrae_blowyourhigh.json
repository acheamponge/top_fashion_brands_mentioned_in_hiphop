I'mma blow your high\nI know you're trying to free your mind\nBut you just wasting time\nAnd Jesus is alive\n\n[Verse 2: Canon]\nWait a minute ya'll\nLet me take it down a river while they rolling down the hedonism boulevard\nAnything that got em' feeling, maybe money or the Lamborghini in the magazine about the sports car\nEverybody wanting satisfaction\nBut there's no regard for The One who has it\nAnd everybody wantin' grabbin'\nBut you gotta get it from above where they stash it\nYou can try to get high\nYou can feel alive\nBut the reality, your soul dry\nYou gotta find anybody with a better high\nYou ain't fillin' half of the $20 bag full of weed that provides it\nGotta make a U-turn cause if you turn\nYou can see The One who turns\nBut if we never make that turn\nYou will never be content with the high you've earned\nYou will never be happy\nRunning with the love of kush\nFor the love of kush, I promise\nYou can either be a slave to an object\nOr rather be a slave to the God who's honest\nThey ain't never seen a high like I got\nBut they fallin' in the puddle like a raindrop\nSteady running from the top of the balcony\nLooking over the Hollywood valleys falling from the rooftop\n\n[Hook: Canon]\nOhh, you think you high but you really getting low\nYeah, you gon' hate it but I had to let you know\nThat in the end we all gon' die, can't escape it if you try\nI know your lighters up but I'mma blow your high (Eyyy!)\nI'mma blow your high (Eyyy!) I'mma blow your high\nI know you're trying to free your mind\nBut you just wasting time\nAnd Jesus is alive\n\n[Verse 3: Lecrae]\nThe wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men\nWho by the unrighteousness suppress the truth\nFor although they knew God, they did not honor Him or give thanks to Him\nThey became futal in their thinking\nThey exchanged the truth of God for a lie\nAnd worshipped and served the creature instead of the Creator who is blessed Forever\nAmen"}], "artist": "Lecrae"}
