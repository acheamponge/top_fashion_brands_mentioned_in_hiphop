I might as well ask\nCause I'm kinda in a giving mood\nI got free advice for the ones that hate\nThis motherfucking nuts for you (bitch)\nI'mma walk with my head held high through these trails of tears\nCause I have nothing to fear, ya'll\nI'm Detroit's first native representing\n87 it was written memorized ready for spitting dawg\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Anybody Killa]\nI'm so proud to die and I'm proud to live\nAnd I\u2019m going to scream it to the world til my lungs give in\nIf there anything I got that you think you deserve\nThen next time contest my nerves, or it's all bad\nCrazy, psycho, not right in the dome, leave me alone\nSo fed up and don't know what to do\nSo now it\u2019s time to ask from you, help me\n\n[Bridge x2: Anybody Killa]\nI know you think I\u2019m crazy\nI do it for you, I do it for you\nEven though it true I\u2019m crazy\nYou crazy too, you crazy too\n\n[Hook x2]", "year": "2008-11-25"}]}
