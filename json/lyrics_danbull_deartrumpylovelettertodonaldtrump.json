Trump\nFor president\nWhatever anyone cleverer says is irrelevant\nJust vote Donald J. Trump\nFor president\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're the landlord of the fellow that played John McClane\nNow there's a real hero\nTake note, John McCain\nDonald knows how to keep the oil price low:\nFind out what they're asking for it\nAnd just say \"No\"\nSee Trump debunk the hoax of global warming\nIf it was true his walk-in freezer would be thawing\nEvidence is boring\nWhereas dogmatic thought isn't\nSo vaccination is the blatant cause of autism\nDriving farmers out of their family homes with force\nWhy? To build a fucking luxury golf course\nOf course\nIt's par for the course, some find it coarse\nYou can't please everyone\nIvana divorce\nMen and women can't work together\nSegregate the military\nEverything'll be better\n'Cause men are rapists, they can't help this\nAnd it's a well known fact women are helpless\nThey're too pretty to risk military service\nThank Trump for Miss USA to give them purpose\nThey do it for the Donald\nFor the Donald\nLet's do it for the Donald\nThe Donald, the Donald\n\n[Chorus]\nI wanna hump Donald Trump\nPut my thumbs on his rump\nThen pump\nTrump\nFor president\nTrump for president\nVote Donald J. Trump\nFor president\nWhatever anyone cleverer says is irrelevant\nJust vote Donald J. Trump\nFor president\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou know how to make America great again\nYou're used to being in debt\nAnd then just starting a new slate again\nFile another Chapter Eleven\nAnd to refill your wallet\nSue a journalist for several billion dollars\nOther men in your shoes might choose to retire\nBut if any of your suggested that to you\nThen they'd be fired\nBring back the death penalty\nExecutioners are MLG\nBlack lives don't matter if I reckon they're guilty\nHey, that's not a racial attack\nLike Donald says\nHe's got a great relationship with the blacks\nAnd what he lacks in tact\nHe packs in stacks of cash\nLand grabs and manly pats on the back\nDonald Trump can break a man\nSimply by shaking hands\nDonald Trump can break a bank\nSimply by making plans\nThrow your bankrupt companies in the air\nAnd pare that debt like you just don't care\n\n[Chorus]\nTrump\nFor president\nTrump for president\nVote Donald J. Trump\nFor president\nWhatever anyone cleverer says is irrelevant\nJust vote Donald J. Trump\nFor president\n\nI wanna hump Donald Trump\nPut my thumbs on his rump\nThen..\n\n[Verse 4]\nIt's the Republican pundit\nPummeling, punishing\nNot pulling punches, pumping up the public\nAnd the publishers are loving it\nYou're bringing fanatical fringe feeling to the forefront\nWith the fab fringe of a bloody Liverpudlian\nTake a little sprinkle of rhetorical eloquence\nThat is as nebulous as that mess of follicle negligence\nBlend a bit of venom and pretend that you're intelligent\nAnd what do you get?\nTo be the next president\nYou impressed us and blessed us\nWith your excellence\nSo we request that you prevent a pestilence\nOf pesky Mexicans\nWe need a reckless non son of an orangutan\nTo rescue America from ending up in excrement\n\n[Chorus]\nI wanna hump Donald Trump\nPut my thumbs on his rump\nThen pump\nTrump\nFor president\nTrump for president\nVote Donald J. Trump\nFor president\nWhatever anyone cleverer says is irrelevant\nJust vote Donald J. Trump\nFor president\n\n[Outro]\nYours sincerely\nDan Bull", "year": "2016-10-28"}], "artist": "Dan Bull"}
