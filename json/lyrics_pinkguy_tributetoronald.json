Nah man, he ain't no clown\nHe don't need another guardian to hold the fucking place down\n\nRonald, I never got to say thank you\nIf you caught me at a KFC, I never meant to hurt you\nI tore down a thousand Burger Kings for talking shit\nHave 'em lost for words on some Stephen Hawking shit\n\nThis cancer's got these little kids biting lips\nIf burgers kill then fuck it, I'm gonna die from it\nI'll fucking die for you Ronald, I hope you understand\nAvoid beef and I'm taking your ass to Pakistan\n\nSee, if Ronald McDonald would have to run a bottle shop\nRonald would unload a couple shots on these fucking cops\nSee McDonald's is the finest china quality\nThat make your legs wobble\nA lava lamp holding Socrates is less post-modern than Ronald\n\n'Cause in a thousand years\nYou and I'll be gone but the patties keep flipping\nThe chicken is still delicious, the living expense is limitless\nSo why the fuck you eating salad, bitch?\n\nSee back in '48 was when I heard of this magic place\nWhen the atom bomb crushed a small country in its natural state\nRebuilt itself into a fine little real estate\nAnd reeled in any American chains with exceptional taste\nBut\u2026\n\n[Outro (only on the music video version)]\n(They don't understand)\nThey don't understand, y'all\n(Who you and I are)\n\n[Alternate Outro (only on the album version)]\nBut all I want to do\nIs to get another taste of you\nKeep cooking\n\nFuck the haters, Ronald, I love you\n*mwah*", "year": "2014-01-31"}]}
