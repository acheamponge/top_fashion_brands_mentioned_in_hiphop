(What sort of problems?)\nIf they catch them, they kill them\nThey don't ask any questions\nThey just kill people\n(Why do they do that?)\nWhat? They're paranoid\nBecause they think they've come to spy on them\nThey're paranoid\n\n[Verse 1: Canibus]\nYour stomach hurt the whole night cause you ate too much GMO rice\nTo go along with your GMO life\nYou just a dummy with a smart phone\nAnd you belong in the poor social class in the country you call home\nThe old grizzly bear with some nappy ass hair\nSelfish motherfucker, no honey to spare, yeah\nEnergy shortage, the poor got to pay for it\nThe water is poisonous, wait a couple days for it\nThird world conditions, no way out\nRelief's on the way, they say it could be any day now\nI say they lying tryna stall you, alter your view\nThe S&M Executioner escort you down the hall\nTo a noose in a FEMA camp freighter caboose\nI trade a pocket knife for a pair of boots\nBorn as a beggar, die with more spiritual treasure\nThe Nebuchadnezzar letters from dead repossessors\nBelly up to the bar, half a bottle of Maker's Mark\nShut the fuck up, it ain't safe to talk\nBy the hook or crook, certainly not ever by the book\nThat's the reason the world's so corrupt\nThe bank is like pussy, they tell you it's yours\nSoon as you turn your back, they open up they drawers\nFlugelrads with computer jobs\nAdam Zakar plays basketball, he just wants cash and cars\nHe lit a match, he wanted to check what's in his tank\nThat's why we all call him \"skinless Frank\"\nA loss of confidence of leadership\nThey don't report till they see the shit hit the fan then they plead the fifth\n\n[Chorus: Canibus]\nProperty, gold, Ice Age, cold\nEs solamente piel y huesos\nProperty, gas gold, Ice Age, cold\nEs solamente piel y huesos\n\n[Verse 2: Canibus]\nCursed, blessed, all in the same breath\nIt's a miracle Germaine got anything left\nThey tell you to relax, then stab you in the back\nWhile the world collapse through small covert attacks\nThey observe the boss, a brown nosers' work of art\nHe tells everybody else to leave the room, then removes your heart\nHe says \"don't ever turn your back on God\"\nThe vampire of emotions and thoughts\nA few adults hug close in the dark\nSomebody opens the door, to find out what emotions are for\nThe future is gone, feast your eyes upon the new world at dawn\nThat's what you get for observing the boss\nCursed, blessed, all in the same breath\nWe had all the time in the world, didn't prep\nMercury extracts the gold from the ore\nThe same thing happens when I write metaphors\nCinderella and the brown dwarf out taking a walk\nThen both bodyguards morph into a horse\nThe horse morphs into Leviathan El General\nLeviathan brimstone and fire emulsifying him\n5, 6, 7, 8 limbs count them again\nI was just standing there in some timbs\nThey had rockets, ratchets and bang sting tactics\nI don't know they names but people call them Fascists\nCouldn't fight that with practice\nIt's like you had to go back in time before all of this happened\nBefore sister rebuke the slaves ancient ways\nWhat rhymes with Dana Dane? Saint Germaine\nSalt and pepper flakes of gray, I was ill back in the day\nKeep pace with the track, tracking the pace\nReport aliens from outer space, laugh in your face\nYou got nothing to say? You had your chance to escape\nHandcuffed to an anvil, so when was your chance to escape?\nDance with the wolves, handshake with the apes\nTake a apple from a snake, watch the Fascist put powder on his face\nCause he don't understand how to relate\nHe didn't even have to use two of his hands\nCause nobody lives longer than a nuclear plant\nWe on food stamps, but get rude about school grants\nWe get mad cause we don't got enough YouTube fans\nEbonic super cram, ruin the plan, two suits take a cruise in a van\nSuper advanced, got something called Zeus in his hands\nFlugelrads with computer jobs, computer program\nIntroduce you to Hip Hop shogun showman\nResistance is futile' the battle rifle shoots two miles\nYou got the juice, the Jones look for you now\nThe son of King Neptune, a million dolphins come to my rescue\nBut I didn't want to impress you\nCursed, blessed, all in the same breath\nAutobot Rock gonna explain the rest"}]}
