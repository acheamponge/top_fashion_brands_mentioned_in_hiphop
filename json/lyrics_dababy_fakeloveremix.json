Ha\nMy whole crew gon' fuck today\nAnd I brought four, five guns inside the club with me\nWho gon' fuck with me?\nI brought twenty bitches on the sprinter bus with me\nWho gon' fuck today? Ha\nMy whole crew gon' fuck today\n\n[Verse]\nI got in the club with a thirty\nSecurity ain't really search me\nWe a hundred deep on purpose\nWhen they see us they get nervous\nWe just came to shut the club down\nI started rap and put the drugs down\nCall my nigga, he the plug now\nI said call my nigga, he the plug now\nHe the plug now, haha\n(Turn up, turn up)\nWe take them pounds and stuff 'em in a rental\nWe fly to california and we send 'em\nSay what you want, just tell me what you spendin'\nI still will pull up and serve you out the window\nI just made a play on the way to the shows\nSo it's fuck the show money, I ain't really trippin'\nAnd I just caught a case 'cause I tried to go get on a plane\nAnd forgot that I still had my pistol\nShoutout to my lawyer, I'm still on probation\nSo I'm tryin' to stay out the way, I be chillin'\nA whole lot of fake niggas showin' fake love\nBut I ain't really bothered, I ain't really trippin'\nA whole lot of gangsters be actin' like women\nThey get on the internet, typin' their feelings\nWhen you see me out, just remember\n\n[Chorus]\nThat I brought four, five guns inside the club with me\nWho gon' fuck with me?\nI brought twenty bitches on the sprinter bus with me\nWho gon' fuck today? Ha\nMy whole crew gon' fuck today\nAnd I brought four, five guns inside the club with me\nWho gon' fuck with me?\nI brought twenty bitches on the sprinter bus with me\nWho gon' fuck today? Ha\nMy whole crew gon' fuck today\n\n[Outro]\nThat ain't DaBaby, that's my baby!", "album": "Baby Talk", "year": "2017-01-23", "title": "Fake Love (Remix)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fa242d3e0e043b6323716b6cd4f41477.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "DaBaby"}
