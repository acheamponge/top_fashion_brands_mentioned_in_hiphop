I'm fine with today\nYou pretty as fuck and I'm tryna slay\n\"Let's do this right now\" is what I'm trying to say\nI can tell you don't love him, you're dying to stray\nI do not give a fuck 'bout your ex\nI'm not looking for love, I'm just looking for sex\nTension between us had me feeling vexed\nThen she sent me a text...\n\n[Hook: Devon Baldwin]\nTake me down\nTake me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving\nBreak me down\nBreak me all the way down, bef..\n\n[Bridge: G-Eazy & Devon Baldwin]\nI really wanna take you down\nMoaning is how I wanna make you sound\nI really wanna take you down\nMoaning is how I wanna make you sound\nI really wanna take you down\nMoaning is how I wanna make you sound\nCan't wait until I get you home\nFuck that I wanna take you now\nI really wanna take you down\nMoaning is how I wanna make you sound\nI really wanna take you down\nMoaning is how I wanna make you sound\nI really wanna take you down\nMoaning is how I wanna make you sound\n\nBreak me down\nBreak me all the way down\n\nI really wanna take you down\nMoaning is how I wanna make you sound\nI really wanna take you down\nMoaning is how I wanna make you sound\n\nBreak me down\nBreak me all the way down"}]}
