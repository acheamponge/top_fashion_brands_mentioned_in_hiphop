(yeah)\nCan we pick up where we left off? (yeah)\nCan we pick up where we left off? (yeah)\nIf you ain't never left us\nCan we pick up where we left off? (yeah)\n(If you ain't never left us)\nCan we pick up where we left off? (yeah)\nCan we pick up where we left off? (yeah)\nCan we pick up where we left off? (yeah)\nCan we pick up where we left off?\nIf you ain't never left us\nThen maybe it's not over\nIf you ain't never left us\n\n[Verse 2: *unknown artist* & KB, Both]\nBe Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;\nNaught be all else to me, save that Thou art;\nThou my best thought, by day by night;\nWaking or sleeping, Thy presence my light"}], "artist": "KB"}
