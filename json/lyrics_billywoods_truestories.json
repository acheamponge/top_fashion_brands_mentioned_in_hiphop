Do tell\n\n[Hook x7]\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nTalk a good one but you right, I don\u2019t want it\nNot for nothin, first line of the sonnet\nTalk like you never got you a shot\nNah nigga you fucked up a lot\nSet my watch off you fuckin up\nTrue stories Op\nTower of London plots\nSay what you will but I always aim for the top\nNeed a fixin to come around the old block\nBut nostalgia ain\u2019t my bag\nRichard the Third with the words I took a drag\nCrushed a roach on the curb\nCabs flagged\nGotta get up pretty early to jerk me\nWhitey grinned as he took the briefcase\nSaid he never went to sleep in the first place"}], "artist": "\u200bbilly woods"}
