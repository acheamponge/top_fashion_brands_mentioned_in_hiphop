That's my intention\nAll that means is smash a rapper, bash a rapper, rapper slash\nRemember what happened last time a rapper flashed?\nTo throw flames he forgot that hell was hot\nNo brains, you just parked your car in Salem's lot\nAnd Sky-Cam knows who I am\nThe shots will be aimed at you, helpless lamb\n\n[ Hook ]\nI hold it down (serve and protect)\nBlow up the spot (serve and protect)\nTake you out (serve and protect)\nThe mic is mine (serve and protect)\nThe time is now (serve and protect)\nI speak the word (serve and protect)\nClose your mouth (serve and protect)\nAnd that's my job (serve and protect)\n\n[ VERSE 2 ]\nStatistics say linguistics pay\nMy mystic display made em insist that I stay\nHuh, I'm on the level where I meditate and levatate\nAnd dedicate every awaken day so I can celebrate\nMy last drink of water, my last piece of bread\nI'm the last bullet in the chamber aimed at your head\nStranger, cause you thought I was better off dead\nNot shot out of anger but duty instead\nLook, me and you rappers got one common thread\nWe both speak the language so you know what I said\nThe spot only grounds where I bled\nThe tracks are my tears from the love that I spread\nGrieve no more when you breathe no more\nDo you believe in happiness or believe in war?\nSpeak no more, talk no more\nI open up my pour-through and I walk through the door\n\n[ Hook ]\n\n[ VERSE 3 ]\nBetter calm your nerves before you get served\nFor sure I give you what you deserve\nAnd then some, I win some, I win some\nI win some, I win some, I hold em for ransom\nHas nothin to do with bein handsome\nWhen I enhance em\nI dance em around like a marionette\nI bet, then string em along like a pet\nPoodle, walk the dog but get stopped in your tracks\nShake the ground and you drop to your back\nThe uncontrollable urge for me and the beats emerge\nSends a surge of shockwaves through my words\nAnd you are my target\nI got a infinite amount of ammunition just to spark it\nIn the end all you heard was a scream\nDiggin as dug in the concrete, a disappearing dream\nAnd don't tell me how it seems\n\nTo hold it down (to serve and protect)\nTo blow up the spot (to serve and protect)\nTo take you out (to serve and protect)\nThe mic is mine (to serve and protect)\nThe time is now (to serve and protect)\nI speak the word (to serve and protect)\nClose your mouth (to serve and protect)\nThat's my job (to serve and protect)\nWith respect", "title": "Serve & Protect", "album": "Accepted Eclectic", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f38e699f6f80a3255420adf5e98a0a8.600x600x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
