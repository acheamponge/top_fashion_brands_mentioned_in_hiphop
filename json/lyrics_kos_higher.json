Far to close to mention\nLove without a second... Far to close to mention\n\n(K-OS)\nYou can take this higher ....And be all the stars above\nYou can take this higher.... than I can\nYou can take this higher ....And be all the stars above\nYou can take this higher.... than I can\n\n(K-OS)\nTheres no need keeping it seperated\nJust show me we moving together now\nAin't no need keeping it seperated\nJust show me we moving together\n\n(K-OS)\nYo   yo\nYou really got me going, you took me for a ride\nFunny how you got two faces, Dr. Jeckle, Mr. Hyde\nI try to swallow my pride but then I choke\nPeople thinking this is just a joke\nNever really got the verses I wrote\nIts just a rap song thats all, people do not care\nDo it for money and power and rolleys in the air\nBut you know who be returning so people dont fear\nI got to take it high and disappear\nI got to do it\n\nYou can take this higher ....And be all the stars above\nYou can take this higher.... than I can\nYou can take this higher ....And be all the stars above\nYou can take this higher.... than I can\n\nTheres no need keeping it seperated\nJust show me we moving together now\nAin't no need keeping it seperated\nJust show me we moving together\n\nYou say you say you say you flying\nAnd it feel so good\n(repeated to the end of the song)"}], "artist": "\u200bk-os"}
