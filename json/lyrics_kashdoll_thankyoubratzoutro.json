But look, let me get straight to it\nThis award means so much to me cause it's a social media award and it was at one point in my career where social media was the only platform that I could use to release music\nSo I really appreciate being apart of this show and being here!\nAnd for all my Kash Bratz voting for me, um, I'm just excited Detroit in the building, let's get it! Haha\nThank you so much! I appreciate it! Bye!"}], "artist": "Kash Doll"}
