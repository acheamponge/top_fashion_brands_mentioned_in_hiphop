Forget that\nYou left me for 2 months, then decided to come back\nBut now I'm doing my own thing, now I bet you regret that\n\n[Chorus]\nI've moved on, I got a new plan now\nI gave my best and you just sat around\nI've moved on, I got a new plan now\nI gave my best and you just sat around\n\n[Verse 2]\nTell me, who you think you are?\nClaiming you a star\nI put in all the work for us to come this far\nClaiming all the credit but you couldn't just admit it but I'm saying just forget it 'cause all of this is bizarre\nI know what we had was fun but it's all because you changed, there was no love and it was enough for me to see you\nBut there's no helping\nNo, I can't explain it\nNo need for yelling\nJust stop complaining\nThat's how you did, kept writing on my bed\nSo don't say a word, 'cause you know it's a fact\nI've been taken for granted and that's for sure\nI've been taken for granted but no more\n\n[Chorus]\nI've moved on, I got a new plan now\nI gave my best and you just sat around\nI've moved on I got a new plan now\nI gave my best and you just sat around", "image": "https://images.genius.com/06a05fac4cd890302cd24b21c773852a.983x1000x1.png", "year": "2011-01-01", "title": "Marvin\u2019s Room (Remix)", "album": null}]}
