Check out the crabs in the bucket\nNo time to get down cause I'm moving up\nNo time to get down cause I'm moving up\nNo time to get down cause I'm moving up\nAhh, haa... Check out the crabs in the bucket\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's like this, It's like this...\nIt's like fly in a room, scream, writing on walls\nSwear this clone been havin' a ball\nClaimin' themselves just before last call\nTic-a-tic-a-toc, tic-a-tic-a-toc\nClock strikes twelve, clock strikes one\nSmoking gun put these fools on the run\nI know it's not that simple, I know it's not that hard\nWhere's your goal?\n\n[Chorus]\nNo time to get down cause I'm moving up\nNo time to get down cause I'm moving up\nNo time to get down cause I'm moving up\nAhh, haa... Check out the crabs in the bucket\nNo time to get down cause I'm moving up\nNo time to get down cause I'm moving up\nNo time to get down cause I'm moving up\nAhh, haa... Check out the crabs in the bucket\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah na I mean\nYeah, I heard you man, yo, check, yo, yo\nIt's a conniption, fit when the microphone's lit\nI take it higher like a bird on a wire, retire the fire\nI'll never cause I'm just moving on up\nChoosin' to touch, the unseen, craving the clutch\nThe most inevitable, legible pyro-mania\nSlaying the devil, and send him back to Transylvania\nStrangely enough, I avoid that side of the ghetto\nFrom my heavy metal, will settle the puppets like Gepetto\nDamn, if mirrors where created by sand\nThen I'm looking in the water for reflections of man\nUnderstand the minds above time when it's empty\nEmcee, tragically hip, ahead by a century, rrahh\n\n[Chorus]\nNo time to get down cause I'm moving up\nNo time to get down cause I'm moving up\nNo time to get down cause I'm moving up\nAhh, haa... Check out the crabs in the bucket\nNo time to get down cause I'm moving up\nNo time to get down cause I'm moving up\nNo time to get down cause I'm moving up\nAhh, haa... Check out the crabs in the bucket"}], "artist": "\u200bk-os"}
