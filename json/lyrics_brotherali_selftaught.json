Why you always so upset? '\nI tell 'em ' Shit, theres a thin line between anger and hunger my man\nAnd I ride a unicycle down the middle, you might catch me touchin' feet down on both sides '\n\n[Verse: 1]\nEver since day number one, it's just me and where I'm coming from\nRites of Passage and Shadows on the Sun\nMy people, I stand before you, As a man with more true shit\nThan he knows what to do with\nI give it all to you, long as you can promise me this\nWhen it's time, you will ball up a fist (like this)\nMe and Anthony, we fill all the gaps in\nAnd are proud of what we make, regardless what happens\nFuck rappin', I sing off key\nOne thing you should never do is dis Ali\nCause, motherfucker, there ain't nothin' rougher\nThen tryin' to climb from the rug you get swept under\nI can run through every one of your blunders\nMistake number one is that your crew don't love ya\nI'll take a bullet for the core of the Sayers\nWhen me and my dogs out tourin' the nation\nI spit with an intensity you have to witness\nLook close, my blood on the back of the tickets\nIt's that religious, it's what I teach my son\nHow to read the Qur'an and how a party is won\n\n[Chorus]\nWe like ' Doctor, don't get it mistaken\nWe carve life out when we sit in the basement\nWe self-taught, it's as real as you make it\nAnyway you look at it this shit is amazing\nDoctor, don't get it mistaken\nWe carve life out when we sit in the basement\nWe self-taught, it's as real as you make it\nAnyway you look at it this shit is amazing'\n\n[Verse: 2]\nWhen line meets mine, we bend ya girl's spine\nFigure-eight status, she got back for days\nThe same old magic will not crack the maze\nThe lights changed since we anted up, pot has been raised\nAnd I'm fucking with the hand I was dealt\nLive twenty-five years to experience what Lazarus felt\nIf you drop three crumbs, I'll eat one\nFeed one to the family, rest'll get invested in my freedom\nI battle through carton of shit\nWith a wrist, full of broken tooth picks, tryin' to carve out a niche\nYou can either choose the heart or the fist, but you will connect with me\nIf your path ever intersect with me\nThe fire in the eye could never be held back, (it's the same)\nPressure that made the liberty bell crack, (it's the same)\nPressure that made my brother E sell crack, (in the name)\nQur'an, holy, Rest in Peace\nMy back is bein' watched by, the only one on high\nWe stride in the party, hoods up, crossed eyes\nBroke as what, but don't give a fuck\nCause I feel I got the world by the nuts, Uhh!\n\n[Chorus]\nWe like, \"Doctor, don't get it mistaken\nWe carve life out when we sit in the basement\nWe Self Taught, it's as real as you make it\nAnyway you look at it this shit is amazing\nDoctor, don't get it mistaken\nWe carve life out when we sit in the basement\nWe Self Taught, it's as real as you make it\nAnyway you look at it this shit is amazing\"\n\n[Bridge]\nHomeboy understand, I ain't mad at you\nThere's just very few things in life I know how to do\nAnd this is one of them right here\n\n[Verse: 3]\nAnd whatever comes up comes out\nWe don't put our hands on our mouths, I stand for what I'm about\nUnknown but I'm still a soldier\nCan't let em go home till I win 'em over\nMy youth was training, it's very clear\nEvery year, new city, new rules to play with (true shit)\nNew kid in school, didn't rule nothin'\nTo this day I rap like I'm trying to prove something\nLittle bit aggressive, when I spit a sentence\nTill you get the message\nYou couldn't pay me to quit professin'\nRock sixty-one sold out shows, came home, and caught a bus to the\nSixty-second\nShirt sweated full of work ethic\nBeen in love with the shit since I first met it\nRhymesayers is the first to come, last to leave\nAin't no tricks up our sleeve, this is what we believe\n\n[Chorus]\nWe like ' Doctor, don't get it mistaken\nWe carve life out when we sit in the basement\nWe Self Taught, it's as real as you make it\nAnyway you look at it this shit is amazing\nDoctor, don't get it mistaken\nWe carve life out when we sit in the basement\nWe Self Taught, it's as real as you make it\nAnyway you look at it this shit is amazing'", "year": "2004-05-11", "album": "Champion EP"}], "artist": "Brother Ali"}
