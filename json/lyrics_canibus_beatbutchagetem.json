Get 'em, metaphorically speaking, this set of bars\nIs letting off till several squads is deaded and weakened\nOr probably beheaded and beaten, severed and leaking\nI get it, started like before I parted I settled in Eden\nBut evolved over the course of time\nMore was just forced to fall off course for the shine (yeah!)\nI'm the ultimate, no alternate\nSwords can give, darts with tips, dipped in arsenic\nMost sound like nothing like after me\nTrack murdered the graveyard's busting at the seams\n(When I crush) like a nug out of the bag of the trees\nTo be honest, your rhymes sound like rotten to me (word)\nI'm the sun, I'm the rise, and the fall\nWhen I die and collapse the whole sky'll dissolve\n(Yeah) And I fight for the cause\nYou should say my name first when describing the boss\n\n[Verse Three]\nPut up your laptop break the boombox plug your infantry your iPod\nNo need for tough talk, or rocking up in the streets with Krylon\nHip-Hop is not forgotten, its been watered down like {?}\nTick tock me waving the time bomb, blowing it up so it don't die off\nThat's why I'm on the job with balls to supercharge your ions\nI be the icon you read about in multiple {?}\nConsulted by God, still open the third eye like I'm a Cyclops\nTo keep my mind strong, I memorize entire rhyme blogs\nEmcees try hard, but many just get sunk like a battleship\nAnd missing a bunch of requirements like {?} an asterisk\nFact or fiction I can't tell the difference when half of these rappers spit\nIgnorant, I bet they don't even know what the meaning of wackness is\nYou actually think you're good, sorry man, your talent is absent kid\nI guess them folks won't ever be dope no matter how much they practice it\nIlly inject the game with passion, putting an end to the abstinence\nThere's so many things for you to fathom but for now it's class dismissed\n\n[Canibus]\n(Get 'em!) As we proceed to MC\nKeep it real recognize the skills over the beat\nHold up, don't shine your boots up, you still suck\nYou can't rhyme like this, unless you rhyming with US\nFuck the questions~! Find out for yourself\nYou got to find out who you help\nService to brothers, service to others, service to self\nThere's no way to tell\nEven if you got a mic in your grill\nYou wanna sell? It's got nothing to do with being ill\nI rock bells with a glass of water and a melatonin pill\nPut your soul into a spell, stay still\nThe universe moving at a pace, perhaps it'll all be revealed\nFor me this all happened because of a record deal\nFor you, this happened because of what you all feel\nAnd now nobody can copy me, I am my own technology\nYou pay homage to me electronically\nOne out of three speak about they flawed philosophies\nBetrayal, that is the cause of all hypocrisy\nWe are living in the garden of technocracy\nI am my own technology, ten thousand G\nWhat's the weight of a light beam? Ask Killah Priest\nHe gon' tell you that your soul is not ready to be released\nI'm a king with a slave's pair of feet, a flat-footed freak\nI walk around hooded in the streets\nLooking for beats, the djinn creep looking for beef\nThey looking for the emcees with the invisible speech\nSo do not even look up at what you are beneath\nJust stare straight ahead and pretend you're on the beach\nMy breathing becomes labored after they shock me with a taser\nI fell to my knees then they shot me with a laser\nBeat Butcha, one thousand bar street pusher like that\nSnap, spring coil tap, release trigger\nMelatonin Magik, metal drones with payload attachments\nShoot me in the head till I stop rapping\nJaecyn Bayne, Son One, Propane Germaine\nOne day I'm a show you what we all made\nMelatonin Magik, the golden child chanted\nDaddy, the cell phone got too much static\nMelatonin Magik is now tracking all known air traffic\nUnknown traffic, just red flag it\nMelatonin Magik, go to sleep, do not panic\nThe heart of your soul is in the planet\nMelatonin Magik, turn your face to the left you maggot\nDon't look at me unless you want a challenge\n(Get 'em!) Architect, Chopp Devize\nReverse polarity, optic eyes in the skies\nMelatonin Magik for minds like mines\nLike mines, like mines, like mines s"}]}
