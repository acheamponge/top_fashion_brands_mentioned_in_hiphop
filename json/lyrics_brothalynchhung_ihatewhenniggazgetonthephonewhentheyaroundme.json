You know what I mean Roberto?\nYou handle business when you get on the phone, nigga\n\n[Verse]\nI hate when niggas get on the phone when they around me\nI really get paranoid, get the 50 pound piece\nPepper box in my socks, use it for ground beef\nI know they plottin' so I don't go to town meetings\nThey wanna hit me like Barry Bonds\nThey wanna get me in the backseat and send me to my mom's\nThey wanna pick me up\nThey want the ambulance to get me up\nThey think I don't know\nI didn't sign up for this\nBlack Market got me in this twist and did a flip-flop back flip\nBut this is Crip-Hop, that's it (cuzz)\nJust wipe your dick off, that's it\nYeah, just get your bitch off, that's it\nJust 'cause your shit's soft, that's it\nI like to get off gat spit\nI like to spit raw rap shit\nI might get shit all backwards\nTakin' it out on the wrong niggas and yeah that hurts\nSo I have to let the gat squirt then disappear\nI'm satisfied and that works\n\n[Outro]\nJust before we get into the last song\nShouts out to Strange Music for puttin' me on\nYa know what I mean?
