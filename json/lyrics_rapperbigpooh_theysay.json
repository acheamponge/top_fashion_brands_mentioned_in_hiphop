And this is for, ha...\nThis is for my niggas, y'know..\nThe ones, that's still my niggas, haha! Yo...\n\n[Verse One: Rapper Big Pooh]\nI done heard I was crazy\nNiggas ain't want me to make my first album\n(How COME??) Guess they was nervous of the outcome\nGet it done anyway, FUCK what the people say\nAs we look around, notice who ain't with me here today\nMy circle getting small, my legend growing bigger\nAnd I'm yet to reach my apex, go figure\nAll the respect I accumulated\nYou could times that by ten and it's understated\nI done been shot down, underestimated\nI done seen plenty try, I'm the one that made it\nI ain't related to ya failures, young'n I'm no loser\nIcebox flow, novice niggas just coolers\n+Slick+ as +The Ruler+, purpose be the jewelery\n'Bout makin moves, rest of y'all tomfoolery\nAin't nobody true as me, ain't nobody cool as he\nY'all about truancy, I'm all about brew to see\nThey say..\n\n[Hook: Choklate]\nThey say they know, but they don't\nSay we should go, but we won't\nThey say so much, but I don't\nLet 'em say what they want (Say what you want)\n\n[Verse Two: Rapper Big Pooh]\nThe world don't stop cause my foot is on the brake\nMy belly ain't full when there's food on your plate\nI'm tired of niggas talking 'bout how they ain't ate\nBut sitting on the net perpetrating like they straight\nThe pace is the pace, I know egos do inflate\nThis life ain't a movie dawg, it's only one slate\nIt's only one boss, Flintstone, no brakes\nThis is all protein (Muscle Milk!) no shakes\nIt's written on your face, I can no longer toy\nWith grown-ass men Peter Pan'n such boys\nWe all make noise, my frequency is favored\n+Return of the Jedi+, better have your lightsaber\nWe can be neighbors, never more friends\nLoyalty is royalty, you'll get it in the end\nI did it once again, it's honor to the death\nOf HOJ 'til I'm done, nothing left\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Three: Choklate]\nForgive me for the second that I lost my cool\nCreeped outside of my zone while in end zone crusing\nLoose with the venom, spirit seering 'em and choosing\nGreatness over settling for further verbal brusing\nI can't wanna get it, I'm supposed to just POV\nAnd stall on my calling and ball on 'em all\nMaybe it's for the best of me to keep climbing on\nGet out to the crest of the mount' on my own~!\nGive the glory to the heavens, manifest good fruit\nWhat you getting is for you for you to get at who you due\nI ain't nobody's saint, I'm bound to fall too\nGetting up out there's a shade of a warrior's cue\nThe battle is within and only few got a clue\nThey're fighting without the inner attack is how you lose\nSitting down at dinner but you not cooking the food\nAnd fat ain't trimmed and the juice ain't cool\nSOMEBODY tell me how the community got room\nTo be, crabs in the bucket and the culture be abused\nNow it's no longer special when we touch the soul's groove\nWe're only really makin-makin room for the true (They say!!)\n\n[Hook]"}], "artist": "Rapper Big Pooh"}
