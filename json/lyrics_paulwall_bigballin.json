Whattup {?}\nI see you on the beat mo' betta\n\n[Paul Wall]\nI'm comin down, candy paint, sprayed by that Eddie\n12 coats of that clear lookin like some grape jelly\nMy paint's drippin wet, my slab is superb\nPark the truck and catchin boppers down here in this dirty third\nI hold it down for the block bleeders workin overtime\nNot concerned at all with petty shit, I'm occupied on the grind\nI keep my mind on breakin bread, makin chess moevs, thinkin ahead\nI soaked up game at a early age, I'm built for this, I'mma seasoned vet\nSwangers symbolize respect, cain't just anybody tip on Vogues\nThey'll catch you slippin in the turnin lane, and leave ya ass naked walkin home\nCandy on chrome is how I drive, with screens fallin in the back of the ride\nMy music screwed and my drank is purple, go and take a sip I'd be obliged\nI'm comin straight from the land of the fry, the city of syrup and the home of Screw\nI'm on the block with my potnah Gooch, stashin cash in my Reebok shoe\nWhat that do I can't complain, the candy gloss drippin off the frame\nBall in the mix I'm off the chain, it's goin down H-Town\n\n[Hook 4X: Paul Wall]\nI'm big ballin baby, yeahhh, and I'm spendin cheese\nI'm on my grind all day makin money with ease\n\n[Paul Wall]\nI'm grippin on that woodgrain, I'm sippin on that good drank\nI'm showin love to every side and every neighborhood mayne\nI got them neon lights glowin, representin my block\nI'm on that 59 South, ridin with my trunk popped\nFrom that Homestead to that Spice Lane, I'm on Scott, in the turning lane\nI'm headed straight to that Timmy Chan's, order up and let's get some wangs\nNew Hawk on that chan-nel, I'm on that dolly right\nOn the way to my gran-ty house, I'm navigated by bubble lights\nI'm tatted by that Junior, I'm cut up by White Mike\nBusted up by that Mr. Davis, sluggin me is a beautiful night\nThat chrome is quite atrocious, complimented by candy gloss\nI'm tiptoein on fo' swangers, eighty-fo's like Randy Moss\nOpen mouth and show platinum grill, it's like a disco ball\nI got expensive tastes, courtesy of expensive jaws\nThey see me comin grill and woman, truck bumpin\nKnockin pictures off the wall is nuttin cause I'm a baller\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Paul Wall]\nWhen the speakers start bumpin and that fifth relax\nI make the trunk dance around like it's doin jumpin jacks\nI'm ridin on them Spyders, them eighty-fo's tiptoein\nAnd that trunk is exalted with them neon lights glowin\nThe candy paint's immaculate, drippin wet up off the fender\nBeat the block up like a boxer, chop the street up like a blender\nI got the flat screens fallin down from the ceiling\nAnd the platinum mouthpiece with diamonds in the filling\nI'm big ballin, grippin grain, breakin bread, I'm stackin change\nGettin money I'm havin thangs with two commas, I can't complain\nDrippin candy paint, off the frame, switchin lanes\nIn the turning lane leavin stains, cause I'm a baller\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2005-09-13"}]}
