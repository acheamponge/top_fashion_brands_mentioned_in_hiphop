Just tell me what I did wrong\nSince you didn't come home, got me sittin', writin' this song\nWhere did I fuck up, baby? Just tell me what I did wrong\nNow you out havin' fun, so I guess you're single now\n\n[Verse 1]\nBitches lyin' on me, tryna break us up\nNiggas lyin' on you, they just wanna fuck\nBaby, you know this industry crazy\nYou know how I deal with these different ladies\nIt's all for the image, you know that I don't love 'em\nIf she lookin' like it's night then, baby, you my supper\nYou the only one I fuck without a rubber\nYour friends lyin' on you, say you fucked my brother\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI believe them, and you believe him\nBack with the bullshit, baby, here we go again\nI believe them, and you believe him\nBack with the bullshit, baby, here we go again\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere did I fuck up, baby? Just tell me what I did wrong\nSince you didn't come home, got me sittin', writin' this song\nWhere did I fuck up, baby? Just tell me what I did wrong\nNow you out havin' fun, so I guess you're single now\n\n[Verse 2]\nGuess you done picked out a letter\nNow you got a lot of niggas\nAsked for your freedom and I gave it to you\nYou just fucked up a pretty picture\nNow you twerkin' in the club and you drinkin' liquor\nDamn, look at all these niggas lookin' at you\nGirl, they just wanna be your baby daddy\nThat's fucked up, you can't even go out in peace\nWithout somebody callin' me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI believe them, and you believe him\nBack with the bullshit, baby, here we go again\nI believe them, and you believe him\nBack with the bullshit, baby, here we go again\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere did I fuck up, baby? Just tell me what I did wrong\nSince you didn't come home, got me sittin', writin' this song\nWhere did I fuck up, baby? Just tell me what I did wrong\nNow you out havin' fun, so I guess you're single now\n\n[Outro]\nLook, I guess you're single and you love it\nThrew our relationship away like, \"Fuck it, fuck it\"\nNow you're single and you love it\nThrew our relationship away like, \"Fuck it, fuck it\"\nNow you're single and you love it\nThrew our relationship away like, \"Fuck it, fuck it\"\nNow you're single and you love it\nThrew our relationship away like, \"Fuck it, fuck it\"\nNow you're single and you love it, love it\nNow you're single and you love it\nThrew our relationship away like, \"Fuck it, fuck it\"\nNow you're single and you love it"}], "artist": "J.
