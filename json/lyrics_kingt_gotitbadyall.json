To the tip\n(And what cha bout to do?) Bout to rip\nSome people use the word funky too loosely\nAnd just how many rappers say they kick it like Bruce Lee\n(What's your favorite brew?) Olde E\n(And what it make you do?) Go pee\nIt used to be about rhymes, all about rhymes\nNow rappers rearranging and changing like times\nI got it bad y'all, I got it bad y'all\nWhen it comes to the pen and the pad y'all\nI got it bad y'all, I got it bad y'all\nWhen it comes to the pen and the pad y'all\n\n[Verse 2: E-Swift]\nBack the fuck up, give me room to breathe\nNot too many niggas can flip the rhymes like these\nI freak the technique as if it was a bitch\nGot more soul than the pick with a fist\nPitch the ball, so I can beat it with the bat\nTalk some shit, so I can smoke ya with my gat\nI'm feeling kinda feeling kinda feeling kinda feeling kinda\nFeeling kinda buzzed off a sack of chocolate Thai\nMy my my ho, I like to rip the shows up\nSmack the hoes that walk around with they nose up\nRun to the liquor store, before they close up\nBuy a few 40s, cause daily I get to' up\nSit at the crib and write riggy-riggy-rhymes\nLine after line after liggy-liggy-line\nYo I can get funky, buy my tape and bump me\nTo the break of dawn I hit the bud and pass it on\nHanging at the park, shooting craps on the weekend\nMy brown bag is wet cause my tall can is leaking\nStaring at the cops, beating up on Rodney\nWhile a pack of O.G.'s stepping to me trying to rob me\nJust because I'm dope, niggas wanna smoke me\nOn the mic I get funky while you're doing the hokey-pokey\nDance steps, I think that you should leave to Paula\nAlkaholiks is the shit, E-Swift's the smooth baller\nIs slangin' these rhymes like a rock\nLife ain't shit but money and a Glock\nDon't punch a clock, but I clock a fat knot\nSo I can smoke a lot of pot that I roll up with tops\nAnd ya ain't heard shit yet, I'm just gettin warm\nLike hot butter on say what? The popcorn\nI'm headed to the top, please give me my props\nMy beats are fat as fuck so bump my shit in your box\nI love to hit the skins, but then again who doesn't?\nI love to hit the herbs cause it leave me feeling buzzing\nI dedicate this chumpie to the poets who can wreck\nAnd to all the natty dreads I gots to give them nuff respect\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: King Tee]\nUp jumps the man with the loot\nRocking like a troop with the Alkaholik group\nEverything is kosher, got a little taller\nLiving kinda phat cause King Tee's a baller\nI just irritate the wack, leave em so confused\nWhen I'm checking on the mic with the ones and twos\nSneak you a peek of the drunk technique\nCan't stand up, need to take a seat\nBaby baby baby it's the Alkaholiks\nBut I can freak the mic no matter how ya call it\nMetaphors grand, and I'm the great man\nDrink a whole fifth yes I can, yes I can can\nThe girls call me dick-em-down\nGot that title rocking for the crown\nCatch y'all later, around next weekend\nI'm a Alkaholik and I'm late for my meeting"}]}
