Aw, same old same\nI'm healthy, I'm alive, I can't complain\n(I see you troopin through the streets tryin to dodge the rain)\nBut I'm heatly, I'm alive, I can't complain\n(Momentum is gained, it intensifies the pain)\nI'm healthy, I'm alive, I can't complain\n(As long as you get to break those chains)\nYeah, I'm healthy, I'm alive, I can't complain\n\nHow does it feel to be truly understood? Well, good\nIt's nice to know you're doin all you should\nBein all that you can be despite your circumstances\nJust buckle up and take the world head on and make advances\nBut don't take chances, we both know the world is scandalous\nThe criminals are everywhere from the south of France to Kansas\nHe dances with wolves, he hypnotizes snakes\nAnd him, he wrestles alligators in the lake\nI'll do all I can but I'm just one man\nWith the microphone in hand\nAnd you know what happens after that\nSometimes I flow with it, sometimes I go against the grain\nBut I'm healthy, I'm alive, I can't complain\n\n(What's up Aceyalone?) Aw, same old same\nI'm healthy, I'm alive, I can't complain\n(It's war on the streets, I can see the bloodstains)\nI'm healthy, I'm alive, I can't complain\n(I heard somebody likes to mention your name)\nYeah, I'm healthy, I'm alive, I can't complain\n(They wet behind the ears and got water on the brain)\nYeah, I'm healthy, I'm alive, I can't complain\n\nThe tenacity for my capacity is beyond my control\nFor it is the truth that i must uphold\nIntake and download and told from the soul\nWherever I go the truth goes and it grows\nWhen evil rears its ugly head it shows\nWay beyond your hairstyles and your clothes\nMark my word, God's temper won't be disturbed\nThe good is much more preferred and deserved\nI overheard a jaybird singin the words\nTo the greatest song written, the fruit is forbidden\nI'm only one man and I'll do all I can\nWith the microphone in hand\nAnd you know what happens after that\n\n(What's up Aceyalone?) Aw, same old same\nI'm healthy, I'm alive, I can't complain\n(See you troopin through the streets tryin to dodge the rain)\nBut I'm healthy, I'm alive, I can't complain\n(Momentum is gained it, intensifies the pain)\nI'm healthy, I'm alive, I can't complain\n(As long as you get to break those chains)\nYeah, I'm healthy, I'm alive, I can't complain\n\n(What you gon' do?\nWhere you gon' run?\nAnd who you gon' run to?) (*4X*)\n\nI'm nearly fit as a fiddle\nExcept for a little\nLimp in my walk and my talk\nThe hemp from the stalk\nIs the only medicine for my rheumatism\nIt helps open up the doors to my mental prism\nRacism, industrialism\nCapitalism, uncivilized socialism\nComputerized, televised, contrived\nMicroorganism, microchip, microincision\nGood machines, bad machines\nFactory rejects and recalls, incorporation schemes\nI'm only one man and I'll do all I can\nWith the microphone in hand\nAnd you know what happens after that\n\n(What's up Ace One?) Aw, same old same\nI'm healthy, I'm alive, I can't complain\n(It's war on the streets, I can see the bloodstains)\nWell, I'm healthy, I'm alive, I can't complain\n(I heard somebody likes to mention your name)\nWell, I'm healthy, I'm alive, I can't complain\n(They wet behind the ears and got water on the brain)\nI'm healthy, I'm alive, I can't complain", "title": "I Can\u2019t Complain", "album": "Accepted Eclectic", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4f38e699f6f80a3255420adf5e98a0a8.600x600x1.jpg", "year": null}], "artist": "Aceyalone"}
