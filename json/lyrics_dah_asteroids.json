{"songs": [{"lyrics": "I told 'em hold up, got this weed to roll up\nHate when people in my business, told my mother keep my door shut\nShe telling me to slow up, told myself to pour up\nMan, I'm half way through this bottle, I'm just hoping I don't throw up\nConvince myself it's helping, but I know it's only hurting me\nCertain thoughts of uncertainty seem to give me an urgency to get bent\nAnother swig up out this bottle then I bounce\nHold up, I'm back inside, I left my keys up on the couch\nMom shouting every time it smell like weed I'm in the house\nI reply, you don't want me here then kick a nigga out, yeah\nTryna avoid the argument\nHit the front door, jump in my homie crib\nRolled a blunt and sparked the shit\nCaught in a fork behind the tints, we creeping through the streets\nSpeakers booming, heat on in case we run into police\nGirl buzzing me, thinking another bitch between my sheets\nGuess she don't know involvement cheese the only time I cheat\nKing of my time, because I'm working while these niggas sleep\nOn my grind with these rhymes, ain't got a cut in some weeks\nHustle like a motherfucker trapping\nBut I'm just tryna get a mil' off this rapping\nGet a mil' off this rapping\nOn my hustle you'd think a lil nigga trapping\nYeah, tryna get a mil' off this, yeah, yeah, yeah so...", "album": "Caveman Files", "year": "2011-03-15", "title": "Asteroids", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8364eac38f8e9f936d9169b02883e6b0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Da$H"}
