Come again\nWhat you say? Come again now\nNothing left to do but let it burn\nI only hope we're all ascending high\nWhat you say? Come again?\nWhat you say? Come again now?\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll around my hometown\nThey tried to chop me down\nBut the truth shall not forsake me\nTake me up to higher ground\nAnd you-ou-ou-ou-ou\nYou're the light when the feeling is dark\nYou're pretending the game is a race\nBecause you're born and you die'll in my heart\n\n[Hook]\nI don't wanna change the world\nI only want to stop pretending\nWhat you say? Come again?\nWhat you say? Come again now?\n\n[Bridge]\nI will never let you down\nI'll be right here beside you, hanging around\nSo if you think you let me down\nLeave me here in silence, without a sound\n\nChange words\nCh-Change burns\nWe came first\nThat's why we're in chains\nAnd there's no one to blame it on"}], "artist": "\u200bk-os"}
