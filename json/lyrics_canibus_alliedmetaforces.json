like a Hollywood script\nBitch-niggas on the floor screaming for mommy and shit\nCardiologists hook up the heart monitors quick\nThermometer temperature dips below 76\nThat's what you get for telling niggas that you better than Bis\nNot possible, if I can't pronounce it, it ain't rhymable\nThe audible probability probably ain't probable\nSupreme rap, G Rap, underground without a rule\nShopper proof, holding hip-hop for hostage, 'bout to shoot\nHelicopters stabilized at low altitudes\nTalking to the negotiator, laying out the rules\nIn a tight compromise salute, road-block with troops\nUnder orders not to shoot, but they break ya vertebrae with boots\nTen o'clock news flash, Bis and G Rap\nAll punch bullets are lookin for them niggas in black\nLean back in the avocado El Dorado, passing the bottle\nSpeakin Japanese like Nomi Masho\nShe got a banging body, cold sushi with warm saki\nIf I'm rappin sloppy, she got me\n\n[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]\nWelcome to my world, danger and hazards\nGang of bastards, banging they ratchets\nKing and the Jacker, slanging in traffic\nClaimin they cabbage, obtain half, they aiming for stackage\nGet brains from the addict, keep blinging with karats\nCops aiming the 'matics, then let ya dame have it, flames to the attic\nThe stains on ya fabric, the paint in the graphic\nCanibus and G Rap banging a classic\nAnd if that beef on the street hate you enough, blow out ya brain in ya casket\nDon't you love this drug element?\nWhere slugs crush ya melon and dome, chrome that's known to break bones in an elephant\nShotgun pellets and, gunsmoke, smell the scent\nBig bullets, wiggle ya guts like gelatin\nCut through ya skeleton, knock out ya intelligence\nRide, stand and bite the dust\nJake wanna be like a Russian cuffed on that Riker bus\nWe raised in the slums with haze in our lungs\nRaisin the guns, knowin;\nMy day'll come, razors under the tongue\nClips in the steel, bricks in the wheels\nChips in the field of fortune\nDead men walking with hits on the grills\nLate night at the spot, posted with goons, dope and balloons\nCoke and the doom, scheme I'll leave you open with wounds nigga\nWitness G Rap put it back in perspective\nBeat up shit with a dash of the peppers\nGet blast for ya necklace, leave ya brains on the dash in ya Lexus\nWe up in the club, dash for the exit\nMake ya spread 'em out, show you what this lead about\nTake it from an old thug, whoever clean cold blood, believe they bled it out\nCrave for the war, pop out rages with fours\nHit the jackpot, blazin the raw, gettin bands in the pores\nBitches and whores with dick in their jaws\nThe frame drank sick of Valor, straight bandit spot\nOpen up shop, turn the block to Planet Rock\nShit with no chop, slept with the Glock with the hammer cocked\nServin the fiends, hop in the Suburban and lean\nLook at that don nigga swervin in Queens, player\nBallin a lot, brawling for props, calling the shots\nHit the curb, birds all on the flock\nJockin, like \"who that there covered in all of them rocks\"\nIt's royalty bitch, fall on the cock, recognize one\nGiacanna G Rap, that live one, pay homage\nGet it fucked up, I spray comments, nigga what?!\n(Nigga what, it's the Curriculum!)\n\n[Verse 3: Canibus]\nYo, e'rything is e'rything my nigga\nI ain't bitter, but if I gave you the finger it'd be behind the trigger\nFaggot-ass nigga living in a gated community\nUp in radio, telling them what you gon' do to me\nI live in the 'burbs\nClean my Winchester every other weekend with the same dirty Hanes shirt\nIt takes two to tango, three to jump rope\nFour to bury the body, plus look out for po'\nYo I guard everything within the limits of my post\nMy orders is to smoke you if you get too close\nThe whole globe scared of my flow, spirit world scared of my soul\nNowadays it's like I'm scared to be known\nThe methods of my motivation is completely subjective\nMy perception is completely parallel to perspective\nRhyming is the reason I spit in faces\nHabituation of my flamboyance without rational reservation\nWhiskey, X-Ray, yankee, Zulu, unusual\nWord-ologically my syllable position is beautiful\nOnly respect niggas if the feeling is mutual\nG Rap snatch the jewels from you, I'll throw 'em in the crucible\nProlly throw you in there too, mix it up and make nigga-stew\nIf you can't admit I'm iller than you\nBaby you sparred with the shadows, Canibus and G Rap bro\nMotherfucker professionallin with the pro's\n\n[Verse 4: Kool G Rap]\nKnow it's, dough over hoes, bankrolls, Rovers and clothes\nAnd shots blow all them cowards and foes\nGiacanna proud with the pros, foul mode\nWe quick reachers, spear with the fearless til you drip liters\nFlip divas, the big secret, strip to they tits and beaver\nSip Cris' and sniff coke of the peeter\nYeah we ball big baby, look off the meter\nYou should see us, it's movie star status\nScar lackers lost cabbage, rip the Pablo Escobar fabrics\nFroze the road we chose, not a pretty route, Diddied out\nGrimey and grittied out, stack dough, jiggy out\nDime bitches behavin like ya sex slave skizzied out\nSome nigga dizzy south, til he's out, busy mouth\nSwerve to the curb, hit the bird split the kitties out\nWe kidnap for trap - blackmail for a gang a mill\nSpot banger himself, fishscale rocks under the fingernails\nThe blood trail lead to a corpse\nTreat my appetite for greed with a torch\nFor keys to a Porsche, to breeze in the loft\nRoll up my hand sheets with the force\nWe squeeze off, no need for remorse, playa\nForty wild goons, with forty Calhouns\nYou die forty foul dooms for forty coward moves\nBless sparkle, and spark until my shorty style rules\nGiancanna dead? Widespread, I'll be a 40 mile tune nigga\nWhat, what nigga? The noble laureate\nComing at y'all niggas..\nUh.. 40-pound style nigga..."}]}
