I'm still counting\nMan, I need counseling\n\n[Verse 1: Pusha T]\nHey! I think I got a problem problem\nAnd I need an open ear to try to solve 'em\nHaving a hard time picking out my darling\nSo until then I guess I juggle all 'em\nNah, I ain't gonna beg my pardon\n'Cause I don't shop for none ya'll bitches at Arden\nB, sippin' on a sweet as a Chardonnay\nI balls, I don't bargain, see\nI used to be all about a fat ass\nThen I found a cutie with a flat ass\nGood head, nice smile but her flat ass\nTwo out of three, shit, I couldn't let that pass\nDoc, what you gon' about this?\n'Cause I ain't got a clue about this\nI'm use to getting what I want, when I want, where I want, how I want\nThen them girls holler \"You ain't shit!\"\n\n[Hook: Pharrell]\nLook at that ass just bouncing\nOh God, I need counseling\nImages in my head steady hounding\nOh God, I need counseling\nYou don't want to bring your chicks around him\nOh God, I need counseling\nHow many chicks do I got?
