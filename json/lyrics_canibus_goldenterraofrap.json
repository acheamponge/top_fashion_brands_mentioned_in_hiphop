Let's weed it out\nFore I turn into something somebody gotta bleed about\nIf I feel the need for speed, do not freak out\nArmor upgrade beneath seat mount\nNo seat belt, breath in, breath out, then lean out\nWhite phosphorus, smoke screen the whole street out\nFire squad gotta reroute, SWAT team can't see now\nRPG launch out the tree house\nGot a casualty, tell me what the beef is about\nHe don't wanna talk, let him bleed out, don't need him now\nPTSD MC, the kind you read about\nTurn the beat up Premier, this is how a beast sounds!\n\n[Chorus]\nI take it back, back to the golden era of rap\nWhen it was exactly that\nNot specifically, jams in the park\nBut when MC's used to talk with advanced thought\nI take it back, back to the golden era of rap\nWhen it was exactly that\nNot specifically, jams in the park\nBut when MC's used to talk with advanced thought\n\n[Outro: Busta Rhymes]\nMu'fuckers better step up your bars!"}]}
