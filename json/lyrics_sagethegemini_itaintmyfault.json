(Ayy, uh)\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhen I pull up, niggas already hating\nWomen love me, it's like Paid in Full in the '80s\nOnly difference, Forgiatos, not Daytons\nThey want my money, they all like, \"Fuck dating\"\nThey're playing innocent until I catch 'em all, ayy\nThat's why the next girl never feeling low-key\nThat's why I grew up a damn soldier\nAnd I ain't got no limits, thought I told ya\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThat's why I ride around, everything clean\nPlaying guapali? Closer to my dreams\nThen it dawned on me, I'm a damn king\nAnd when I get home, she gon' question me but\n\n[Chorus]\nIt ain't even like that\nWhen I leave, I'm coming right back\nAnd sometimes she don't like that\nI don't even fight back\nAll she want me to do is pay attention\n'Cause we know young niggas don't listen\nIt ain't my fault, sometimes it's these bitches\nWhen a young nigga on, they listen\nThey just love me for the shine and the glisten\nBut hey, I already know...\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou ain't got to be so insecure (Okay)\n'Cause losing you also my biggest fear (Okay)\nYou call me, you crying, I'm switching gears (Okay)\nWhen I hit it, we shaking the chandelier (Hey)\nFuck these other hoes, they ain't shit, you don't hear me though (You don't)\nI'd drop them all for you, you don't feel me though (You don't)\nYou more like Paul Martin's, they get Rubio's\nWhen you call, I don't pick up, I'm at the studio\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThat's why I ride around, everything clean\nPlaying guapali?
