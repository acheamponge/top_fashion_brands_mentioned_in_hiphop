tells me this\nBut because I put the Ultimate Warrior to shame in the Super Post Down\nAnd it won\u2019t be long until you see the sexiest man alive with the title belt around his sexy waist\nAnd for all you ladies wondering about the Rude Awakening, I have raised my standards\nI now come to town with the bear size 5 Calvin Kleins and a 36DD\nAnd if you don\u2019t fit the mold, don\u2019t dream of
