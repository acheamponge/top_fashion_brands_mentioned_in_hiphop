We back...\nAs if we never left this bitch... on top... it's worldwide...\nStill Just Blaze'in this shit up...\n\n[Verse 1]\nEvery place I visit, I got land there\nHow could niggas stand there\nSay I sound like them? Hell no\nPush wigs back, push Bentley drops that's yellow\nStarted from the elbow, nigga, from the get-go\nNo, not the Geico, ain't nothing accidental\nJust the facts that I've been through\nPerhaps if you was into\nHalf of the shit I've been through\nThat'd make your pen move\nYour mind would open, your heart would bleed\nInstead y'all niggas flow oh so retardedly\nYou sound retarded to me!\nHow could you stand there, pants near down to your ass, you wanna spar with me\nI'll put you down in the grass, it's the God MC, Young V-I-T-O\nYoung'n, you are my hijo\nMy son dula\nI clean the cesspool up\nRap stinks\nYou cats are the Sphinx\nYou cut off your nose to spite your face\nBet you like it that way don'tchya?\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't you know?\nWhen you're defeated, young punk?\nWon't you throw\nWon't you throw in the towel, stop running your mouth\nDon't you know that we know you're just running your mouth\nCause when this shit pops off, we gonna run in your house\nDon't you know\nWhen you're defeated, young punk?\nWon't you throw?\nWon't you throw in the towel? I'm better with vowels\nMy vocabulary murders the dictionary\nFlow switches every 16, shits mean, man\n\n[Verse 2]\nShit, I'm heavy in the game\nI ain't worried 'bout a thing\nLast man standing\nBlam-blamming the cannon\n48 Hours, it's Reggie Hammond\nThe colte, Nick Nolte\nMy demeanor is Humphrey Bogie\nBaby, I'm comfy, cozy, my spot is solidified\nRoc-a-bye baby, I sing you a lullabye\nHow ill am I? BK to Philladi-\nDelphia! Niggas feelin how real am I\nShit, I carry two Taurus, niggas they call me Gemini\nThough my birthday is one day before December 5\nIt's S Carter, the archer, I throw darts at ya\nArrows through your apparel, I will dearly depart ya\nIt's clearly hard for ya, what God has bestowed on me\nYou nah destroys me nigga; nigga I'm poetry\nIn four part harmony, it's like Jodeci\nCheck out my melody, my flow is a felony\nOh, I'm so seventies, I'm in tune with the heavenly\nGoverning body - Check, check, check out my destiny\nI walk leaving four footprints\nMy hood sense\nMy book smarts\nMy faith of the unknown\nAnd a good heart\nWhat's seldom shown is the good part\nLike I said\nTry to bring 'em life, but they want dead\nYou won't listen\nHov' is a nice guy, but you don't miss him\nThat'll piss him off quick, you won't listen\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't you know?\nWhen you're defeated, young punk?\nWon't you throw\nWon't you throw in the towel, stop running your mouth\nDon't you know that we know you're just running your mouth\nCause when this shit pops off, we gonna run in your house\nDon't you know\nWhen you're defeated, young punk?\nWon't you throw?\nWon't you throw in the towel? I'm better with vowels\nMy vocabulary murders the dictionary\nFlow switches every 16, shits mean, man", "title": "Don\u2019t You Know", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a917a7860d941ea37e5282ff431e1a05.688x688x1.jpg", "year": "2002-11-26", "album": "Dame Dash Present: Paid In Full Soundtrack"}], "artist": "JAY-Z"}
