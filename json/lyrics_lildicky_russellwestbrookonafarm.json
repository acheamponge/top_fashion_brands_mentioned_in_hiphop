it\nAlways told myself that this the type of shit I wanted\nI was being honest, even made a promise\nNot with anybody else, this was inner conscious\nTalking to my fucking self, das' a little bonkers\nI know, I still got a lot of shit to conquer\nI hope that ain't even my concern though\nYou know I\u2019ll be working till I get what I deserve\nWhatever totems I get personally you know I\u2019ma earn those\nThis ain't even 'bout some shit up on a checklist\nThis about the fact that I\u2019m about to test this\nI\u2019m about to figure out what my best is\nI can't avoid it because now ya' boy invested\nAnd I ain't gotta a choice except to smile and accept it\nPretty reckless, pretty restless 'cause\nI\u2019ve lived my life expecting love\nTo come the second my attempt was done, and yeah, I guess\nTo some extent I was correct because I\u2019m getting buzz\nBut now I\u2019m 'bout to be ubiquitous, look it up\nYeah, or that\u2019s at least what I\u2019m assuming\nBut as alluded to reality is looming and\nNow ya' dude about to make a move and take the truth\nAnd hope to god that when he through\nThat what he thought about is proven\nBut honestly, I'm not afraid that it\u2019s delusion\nI\u2019m hot enough to where I know it\u2019s not illusion\nBut obviously I been finding this confusing\nThis ain\u2019t even close to what I thought I would be doing\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I was born to be big\nBut I always figured it would be the comedy thing\nSo I started rapping just to see what drama it brings\nWhat big dogs from sitcoms would holler at me\nAnd as the time past, I rhymed faster, lines crafted\nWas high class as I mastered my craft, and\nGoddamn, who\u2019da thought it get like this\nBack in twenty-ten music wouldn\u2019t make that list\nI\u2019m talking top five-to-ten strengths, with no winks\nI would not lie, my pen dry, with no ink\nOr, that\u2019s at least what I thought 'til I clawed and scratched the pen 'til I saw a line draw\nThen I coulda let bygones be bygones\nBut I really wanted to rhyme till my line drawn\nLike where the fuck is my peak at?\nNot Brown but I make it pop, then I beat that\nNot crowned yet, but I don\u2019t think I decreed that\nNot loud, but you know I\u2019m ready to tweet that\nI just really hope I\u2019m ready to be that\nNow you seeing where D\u2019s at\n'Cause even though I\u2019m softer than a tissue\nI ain't nothing to sneeze at\nI\u2019m smarter, where fuck ya' degrees at\nAnd I ain't harder but I\u2019m hotter homie, where da fuck ya degrees at\nI\u2019m 'bout to come in and desaturate\nThe chic rap today and evaporate\nThe feedback I hate, I elaborate\nAt a later date\nBut I\u2019m getting off the point with the player hate\nWhat the fuck was I saying, oh yeah\nI\u2019m kind of a slave\nTo my ambition, I ain't quittin' till my shit is appraised\nAnd I admit it, I predict that where I finish is crazy\nBut that just means that it\u2019s further away\nSo, Burd about to work until he turn in his grave\nIt\u2019s really burdensome when earning something\u2019s fun for the day\nBut I\u2019m concerned about da' burning out from upping the stakes\nI\u2019m always uppin' the stakes\nI\u2019m taking dinner meetings in New York, always up for the steaks\nWe exploring the discussion of great\nThey assuring me that when I\u2019m more elite I\u2019ll be secure and amazed\nBut this isn\u2019t insecurity mang\u2026\nLike this the opposite of that, confidence in fact\nMy biggest problem is I can't honestly relax\nBecause inside of me a damn odyssey enacts\nAnd I made a promise that I can't be the body\nThat\u2019s stopping it, think I need a lobotomy\nLil Dicky the prophecy, little bit of anomaly, not a commodity\nNot a fa\u00e7ade, or a lotta da Comedy prodigies\nCommonly brought up wit Dicky\nFeelin' weird, lemme think of an analogy\nJust imagine for a second what if Russell Westbrook never knew his own mentality\nGrew up on a farm where the biggest commonality\nWas people that conform to the ruralest localities\nTo Russell though it was nuffin' but normality\nAnd he really nice up on the plow in actuality\nEverybody liked the kid and dug his personality\nAnd so da mutuality was somewhat rationality\nSo then ya man made a plan of practicality\nNot even a plan, it was more of a formality\nGet a little land and attend to its vitality\nThen raise a little fam 'til it all became finality\nThe strategy was just to stay in the course\nAnd do ya chores, when ya' happy ya' ain't need to abort\nNever explored nothing less he rollin' round on his horse\nThen one day he was up on his horse\nThat\u2019s when he went past the porch, the path he normally\nPasses forth was fast and short, was after more\nWent faster north, amassed a lure to master more\nAnd then discovered the court\nHe like ya! Let me down Tim\nHopped off, lookin' puzzled at the round rim\nSaw a ball up in the corner on the ground then\nRussell started dribbling and giggling astounded\nThen he shot a brick and then a brick and then he downed it\nAnd when he hit it Russell listened to the fuckin' sound friction\nUp in a swish make and he was confounded\nBecause he knew that he had found him\nBut right now; it was still for the fun\nJust a way to kill the time when the farming was done\nThen the walking turned to running, and the hoppin' turned to jumping\nAnd dunking, and Russell had to keep coming\nBecause the young\u2019n was fucking disgusting and loving it\nRunning it, all of a sudden the public started to come in abundance and fuck wit him\n'Cause he was butter and hungry, hung jury\n'Cause stories of glory, not normally for people like him\nThen the word got around up to ESPN\nAnd they flying Russell down to compete in the gym\nBunch a grown men lookin' to belittle the kid\nBecause to those men, ball was the reason to live\nAnd the G.O.A.T.S. they been all in since they was kids\nSo this goat owning mafucka look like a dick\nAnd even know Russell knows that, he doesn\u2019t submit\nHe just chills with a grin\nAnd then the game start, and this muthafucka take charge\nMake it rain, hard D up on these bitches making children of men\nLookin' better than his predecessors ever could get\nTurned the animosity to respect\nAnd then the Thunder called him\nSaid they heard a lot about the ballin'\nTold him that they wanna get involved and\nShowed him all the shit that you can get up in the league, it\u2019s so appalling\nOklahoma City in the autumn, hella pretty\nAwesome, errbody laud him\nErry-bitty lookin' like they really fucking fallin'\nCondominium is so legitimate it\u2019s sprawling\nAnd this muthafucka on the court straight ballin'\nCash all up in that ass, lol\u2019ing at the past like\nWhere the fuck would I be at up on the other path, right?\nIf I never stumbled 'pon the game then think of that life\nShit, who taking care of my farm?\nWho taking care of my farm?\nWho taking care of my farm?\nI really loved that farm, uh\n\n[Outro]\nCAKE, CAKE, CAKE, CAKE, CAKE\nFive-hundred million now that\u2019s a pound cake\nAccording to Jay Z, and Drake\u2026\nBut greatness ain\u2019t about cake"}], "artist": "Lil Dicky"}
