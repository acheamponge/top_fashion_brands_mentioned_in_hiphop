Any other apologies you wanna make?\"\n\nPimp C \"Let me say this: That statement about Russell Simmons had nothing to do with his sexual orientation. It had more to do with a disagreement [we had]. I don\u2019t know if the man likes Martians, squirrels or whatever, so I ain\u2019t gonna speak on something that I didn\u2019t see. It\u2019s no gay-bashing with me. It\u2019s just, be proud of what you are, instead of hidin\u2019 in the closet. And if ya fuck boys in the ass, then don\u2019t be tryna fuck with the girls, too, poisoning the pussy population wit\u2019 ya shitty ol\u2019 dirty-ass dick.\"\n\nInterviewer: \"So Pimp C is not a gay-basher?\"\n\nPimp C: \"I\u2019m not a gay-basher, because gay people buy my records. Why would I be offended by your sexual preference, unless I\u2019m in the closet? If ya like boys, go get all the boys ya want. And whatever you did that you ashamed of, don\u2019t do it no more.\"\n\nInterviewer: \"Do you ever feel any compassion for Bun B, for being in a group with a man like yourself, who is unfiltered and can be bullheaded in his ways?\"\n\nPimp C: \"You been programmed to think I\u2019m bullheaded. I just know what the fuck goin\u2019 on. I know who\u2019s a faggot, I know who lettin\u2019 them girls fuck \u2019em in the ass with them dildos, I know who really sold dope, I know who didn't. I be in Houston. The only nigga I see [in Houston] goin\u2019 to the mall by himself is Slim Thug. Other niggas, when I see \u2019em, they got bodyguards around \u2019em. How you gonna be scared of the neighborhood you supposed to be reppin\u2019? All them [Houston rappers] that think they stars, guess what, bitch? Ain't no stars down here. Only stars is in the muthafuckin\u2019 sky!\"\n\nInterviewer: \"So the only Houston rapper you\u2019re acknowledging is Slim Thug?\"\n\nPimp C: \"I didn\u2019t say that! I said, again, the only nigga I see at the mall by himself is Slim Thug. You magazine muthafuckas need to have more responsibility for what you write and put on your goddamn covers. I couldn\u2019t get on a Source cover \u2019til I went to prison. I had to go to prison to get on the cover of yo funky-ass magazine?\"\n\nInterviewer: \"But, Pimp, you do know this isn\u2019t a Source interview, right?\"\n\nPimp C: \"I know this ain\u2019t The Source. I\u2019m riding on them in yo book! So if [they] wanna give promotion off the negativity, then eat my whole dick and nuts at the same time. I\u2019m not talkin\u2019 to you, but, like, you gotta ask the hard questions. I gotta answer the hard questions in a hard-type manner.\"\n\nInterviewer: \"Anything else would be uncivilized. In your Ozone interview, you referenced rappers lying about their drug rep\u2014specifically, Mr. 17.5, which is Young Jeezy\u2019s nickname. Why did you call him out?\"\n\nPimp C: \"So that\u2019s your opinion? You\u2019re basing your opinion that I went after Jeezy \u2019cause the same number that he calls himself is the same number that I used in my interview?\"\n\nInterviewer: \"Uh, yeah, he\u2019s the only person I know that calls himself Mr. 17.5. So, yeah, I guess you can say I assumed that\u2019s who you were referring to. But was I wrong?\"\n\nPimp C: \"First of all, Jeezy is a cold muthafucka with a microphone who, in my opinion, gotta have something in him that\u2019s street or somebody street around him that\u2019s instillin\u2019 something in him. Now that I gave him his compliment, let me go on. Don\u2019t single out Jeezy, because he ain\u2019t the only one that\u2019s kickin\u2019 numbers that don\u2019t match. Have you ever sold drugs?\"\n\nInterviewer: \"Excuse me?\"\n\nPimp C: \"Well, you do know there\u2019s no water around Atlanta. So all the drugs in Atlanta either come from Miami or Texas. Ain't no way those prices match up. If work in Texas is $15,000 to $16,000 a ki, you gotta pay a muthafucka $2,000 to $2,500 a bird to bring it back to your city. How you gonna sell it for lower than you got it? A muthafucka might be cold and go down to San Antonio to buy it straight from the muthafuckas that get it across the border for $10,000. But news flash: I know you muthafuckas ain\u2019t comin down here to get it, \u2019cause we woulda saw ya. See, real niggas don\u2019t swap it out. We get ya on the next batch. But Young Jeezy is my brother. I done made records with the nigga. I\u2019m not gonna side with the media against my brother. It\u2019s just that these dope prices\u2026 It ain't even just the South. It\u2019s a bunch of niggas lyin\u2019 on records. Y\u2019all ain't gettin\u2019 it like this on the East Coast, neither. Just stop, \u2019cause y\u2019all know y\u2019all gotta come get this work from us. Chuuch.\"", "year": "2007-09-07"}]}
